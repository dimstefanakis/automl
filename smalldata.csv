"Hey guys, I looked for the answer to this question on here before posting and couldn’t find anything, but if I missed it and it’s a frequent question, my apologies.

So basically I’m actively trying to get better at running and lose about 30 lbs of fat (for now) off my body. I started running around March of this year and improved dramatically, losing about 30 pounds (combined with dietary restrictions) and improving my run time and pace. My most common running distances are 2.4K and 5k, I usually go for a run every other day, so it would go 2.4K, break day, 5k, break day, and so on. I’d like to up it to 2.4K, 5k, break day, repeat. Is this too much? I guess I’m the only one who can really judge that but I don’t want all the issues lots of high-impact cardio can bring. I’m also open to general suggestions if you think I’m doing something wrong here.","fitness,fitness"

"I'm assuming everyone's primary reaction is going to be instantly to say buy a rack, barbell, weights instead, although the cost of that also adds up to about $2000-$4000 range. 

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. 

The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.

Personally, I doubt that it's worth the money since there are cheaper home gym alternatives but if tonal were to get cheaper in the next few years, do you think the level of convenience it provides may be worth the money?","fitness,fitness"

/u/FGC_Valhalla is MIA, and I need reading content for tomorrow's session, so here's the thread.","fitness,fitness"
"Hey guys!

I came across a really interesting article and I am wondering if someone has done this type of training before, or what some people's thoughts are. 


To try to condense the article, it suggests using different weights to create uneven loads. It gives this example. ""When selecting your weights for off-balance weight training, start by making sure the heavier side has 5 to 10 pounds less than normal for unsupported movements (meaning not laying on the ground or on a bench). Then subtract another 5 to 10 pounds for the other side. For example, if your Walking Dumbbell Lunge is normally performed with 40-pound dumbbells in each hand, I’d start with a 30-pound dumbbell in one hand and a 20 or 25-pound dumbbell in the other hand. Then, and this is crucial, you want to make sure you perform an equal number of reps with the dumbbells swapped. So if you start with the heavier dumbbell in your right hand and the lighter dumbbell in your left hand, you need to ensure you’re performing an equal number of reps with the heavier dumbbell in your left hand and the lighter dumbbell in your right hand"". 

The justification for this type of training is that in the real world we dont deal with perfectly balanced weights, so training this way helps us in a more practical sense. It also discusses stabilizing muscles. 

Anyways, I'm interested in playing around with this type of training, but just wanted to see if someone has done this before and/or what are some people's thoughts. 

Here is a link to the article if you're curious.

I'm looking for a wearable heart rate monitor that I can use to see whether I'm in an aerobic or anaerobic range and to track some HIIT workouts.

Ideally I would like to be able to download the info to my laptop and view the data but I don't want a device that requires registering an account and viewing the data through an app or website that is going to talk to the cloud like a FitBit does.

"Hello! 

As mentioned, this is my first post here, so I’ll just jump right in to it and explain.

I (male, 20’s) do a lot of different activities (mostly running, cycling, skating on ice, crossfit. High intensity is Key), but recently i’ve lost interest in doing these kind of activities alone. In fact, I think its straight up boring just having to do these things by myself. I want to share my training experience with somebody, talk about the training session, and so on. 
Its just about having someone interested in the same kind of things as me. If i want to do a hike in the mountains, i usually have to prepare myself that its just going to be me.

I have a girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to be involved in these high intensity training sessions. With her, i usually just walk. I also have some friends that I ask if want to join me, but they never want to.

I’m not even an extreme kind of training guy, i’m just average and want to be in physical activity. When I first started training, i didn’t care about being alone. But Now i think about training as some kind of experience, rather than some kind of personal goal. 

I dont how to solve this. 

QUESTIONS: Do any of you struggle with the same?How do you manage to exercise alone? 

I’d love to have your take on this.","fitness,fitness"
"I have never seen anybody except for obese people talk about walking as exercise on Reddit. I am curious for myself because I am obese (6'2 and 256) and I'm trying to walk an awful lot because I love it, but I don't do much else exercise.

I'm sure other forms of exercise are better for you (running would benefit you in cardio better, and lifting would benefit you in muscle tone better). But surely walking is much better than sitting on the couch.

What physical benefits does walking give you, and what distances are required to achieve any noticeable benefits?

And what are the differences, in terms of physical benefits, between different kinds of walking (pavement vs. rough, flat terrain vs. hiking up a mountain)?

Edit - thank you for all the support! I haven’t felt this much motivation in ages.","fitness,fitness"

"Hi all, 

Curious about what others think about dipping to 90 degrees or all the way down on stationary weighted dips. 

I dipped with 90+lbs attached to my armpits without problem. Guess I had the shoulder mobility. I also felt the full ROM would help prepare me for strict Muscle Ups. 

Al Kavadlo seems to dip to his armpits on parallel bar dips [here](https://youtu.be/0tk1H8XwUYY?t=26). However, he probably does not load weight since he is a bodyweight purist. 

I know on ring dips gymnasts utilize the full ROM. But maybe my weighted dip will improve if I go just to 90 degrees instead of ATG like my weighted squat. 

On a related note, I have been trying to go ATG on weighted squats for years. Couldn't go past 250lbs with my 6' 2"" frame. Went to just 90 degrees and was (obviously) able to increase to 315lbs on the first go. Less lower back pain too. However, I know folks that would argue ATG on squats is the way to go. Maybe for pistols. But on weighted squats I could never get rid of the butt wink sufficiently. Always lower back soreness eventually on ATG weighted squats. 

Thoughts?","fitness,fitness"

Hello! My primary focus at the gym was cardio up until today. Today, I lifted weights for about an hour (compound lifts + tricep isolation), then I hopped on the elliptical for 20 minutes.

My average HR shot up while I was on the elliptical (161 bpm). When I was doing cardio alone, my average bpm was around 145-150 over 35 minutes.

"Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. ""Non-negotiable"" as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn't possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip.

"Hi y’all:
New Years resolution is to work on my flexibility and (hopefully) get to the point where I can do a front split on the floor. For reference, I’m a pretty fit female (above 30). I’m not terrible with flexibility, but I’ve never been able to do the front split. I’ve never tried or trained consistently for it. 

Can someone give me a good routine that would help with this? How long do you think it would take me be able to do a full front split? Thanks","fitness,fitness"
"#[Link to Article](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/what-is-the-best-method-of-cardio-for-fat-burning/)

In this blog post from Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, he summarizes a recent meta-analysis his team performed comparing HIIT and moderate intensity exercise on fat loss:

[Slow and Steady, or Hard and Fast? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Comparing Body Composition Changes between Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/11/155/htm)

He notes a previous meta-analysis came to a different conclusion but has since been retracted after several oddities were found.  (Which, as an aside, [seems to be a thing](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/17/exercise-researcher-earns-more-retractions-as-investigations-mount/) plaguing Brazilian research lately.)  

The new paper is open source and worth a read, but Brad sums it up nicely by saying:

>Take-home: We can confidently state that HIIT cannot be considered a “magic bullet” for fat loss; MICT is equally as effective for achieving this outcome.

Still, the data is not without its limitations and Brad does a good job laying those out and further explaining how different protocols may lead to different results.  Then concluding with a message I don't think can be repeated enough:

>Research can help to guide exercise prescription, but ultimately you must determine the best course of action based on individual needs, abilities, and goals.","fitness,fitness"
"So running on a treadmill for 30 min really makes me exhausted and raises my heart rate and according to the calorie counter, I have burned around 350 calories or something during that time, but it really takes a lot of effort.

If I spend the same amount  of time on an elliptical or on a bike, I will be a lot less tired after 30 min but according to the calorie counter, I would have burned much more calories

I know that you really cant rely on the calories burned counter on cardio equipment like treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machines etc BUT those numbers must be calculated based on something. And its the same with different brands of equipment in other gyms. The exact amount of calories burned will differ a little, but ellipticals and bikes will still burn more calories but with much less effort.

This has really made me curious. Are these numbers completely wrong, or do some forms of cardio burn more calories than other forms even though performing it hardly makes you tired?","fitness,fitness"

"I posted on here a couple of months ago that I struggle with my bench due to having very long arms, and I was wondering about the merits of breathing into the chest to shorten the range of motion, compared to breathing into the belly like you would in a Squat or Deadlift. I was essentially told back then that it was a bad idea. 

Elitefts have recently made a video on YouTube specifically addressing bench press for long limbed lifters, saying that breathing into the chest is a good idea.

With this in mind, what are your opinions of this now that a well known powerlifting brand has advocated it?

"Hi there.  I'm about to take the leap into the beginning stages of body building.  I've hired a personal trainer to work with for a couple of months, because I don't know what I'm doing and haven't lifted anything beyond a couple of 10lb free weights

One question I know they will ask is what are my goals? Well I don't know.  I know I want to be able to carry my dog if he gets hurt (he's 100lbs) and not struggle or accidently drop him.  I want to look strong and be intimidating (lol).  I want to eat without guilt, and I want to be able to see my belly button again.   But besides being able to help my dog,  the rest aren't really tangible goals,  right?  I could say I want to lift Xlbs, but that doesn't mean anything to me.
The gym I'm joining is mostly geared towards show body building, and they have some serious before and after results - like where people heavier set than me when they started compete after 9 months!

How do you pick your goals so you have something to work towards and complete?  Did you have any to start? What are they now?  

Thank you.","fitness,fitness"

Added on a quick question, always here about how cardio doesn't contribute to weight loss (although still very important to do) but the time is better associated with lifting weights. 

I'm a 250LB, 5'11 male who has some muscle from my labor focused jobs, mostly fat. 

Should I treat cardio as a warm up to strength training(I'm thinking 30 minutes of treadmill) ? Or does it deserve its own accord?  


My goal is to lose 50LB's while building muscle, is there a certain time line I should bench mark myself in to lose that weight within a certain time period (while gaining muscle)?

What I'd like to do is add those accessories but not extra days. Will it be at least somewhat effective if I do one week of compounds like I do now, and alternate with a week of accessories? Something like Compounds: MWF Cardio: T, THU SAT; Accessories: MWF, Cardio T, THU, SAT; Repeat.

This is basically my current workout. I am going to drop the extra calories.

Are these a good measure, and more importantly are they all consistent with eachother? If I hit one, should I be able to hit all 4 goals roughly around the same time, if they are all trained of course.

"I haven’t been guaranteed a solid 15-30 min for a while. Some years back it didn’t really bother me much as it would get so busy, I’d forget I was hungry. Now that I have fitness goals, it’s extremely difficult to meet them as I’m always at a caloric deficit with this work lifestyle. I notice this being common in medicine, but I’m open to hearing from those in different professions struggling with similar obstacles.

I already have a hard time eating enough when I had the opportunity to eat 3 meals a day. Now, I’m unintentionally skipping lunch to meet high patient volume demands and my workouts are taking a hit. I have less energy, feel weaker, no incremental gain in strength. My appetite is dropping even more. I’ve been feeling defeated lately. Especially since most of my friends don’t exercise nor do they understand my work schedule, so I don’t have anyone to really talk about this with.

Anyone else on a similar boat? How do you feel about it? Did you overcome it?

"Hi all! My apologies if this is answered elsewhere; I couldn't find it.  
  
Four months ago I joined a group fitness class. I usually hate group fitness classes because I'm always one of the most unfit people there. However, this is one of those classes where you wear a heart rate monitor and it puts your % to max HR up on the front screen along with everyone elses. This was really the motivational ticket for me, because it meant that even if I was clearly not doing as many reps as everyone else, it was still evident that I was doing my damnedest. I really enjoyed pushing myself to 95%+. My competitive streak was driving my fitness.  
  
Lately, though, it seems like I'm still pushing hard and still hitting that wall but my heart rate is only going to ~90-92%. I can have an absolute meltdown on the rower and still not really breach 90%. I thought something might be wrong with my heart rate monitor, but I asked the trainer and he said that my heart may not be my limiting factor anymore.  
  
I watched the clock and counted my beats and it seemed like he was right, I'm still hitting that ""can't possibly push any harder"" wall but only getting to 90% heart rate for my age.  
  
It makes sense that my heart would be getting more efficient at its job over these four or so months, but if the ol' ticker isn't what's redlining anymore, what part of the process is limiting how much I can do? Lungs?  
  
Sorry for the wall of text, thanks for the help!

My sleeping routine is messed up even tho I started sleeping early and get 7/8 hours of sleep. Done with the informations, I started lifting about less than 2 months ago,  my aim is always been strength, I don’t really care as now to be cut and lean (aesthetic), I’d rather be big and bulky with some strength.

My squats went from 185 1x4 to 225 lb 1x5 and my deadlift went from 315 1rm to 1x5 and my 1rm is 365. So the question is how is my progress? I really want to have powerlifting numbers one day, bench 495, squat 600 and deadlift at least around 800.

"Hi there. I'm a 16 year old trans guy (for all intents and purposes, I'm physically a girl but I'm dropping this info so I don't get misgendered or anything). I have a few basic goals - lose fat, gain strength, and fix my posture (I have both kyphosis and lordosis). Problem is - I have dyspraxia, which is a disorder that affects a lot of things, but the most important thing is that it has decimated my balance and hand-eye coordination. I can't really do a lot of exercises like step-ups or squats because I just can't balance well enough. Does anybody have any ideas on how to start? Apparently, working out does help dyspraxia symptoms so this probably won't be a problem for long, but I honestly have no clue on where to start since so many exercises just aren't really possible for me right now.","fitness,fitness"
"Hi All,

I have searched google high and low for an answer to this question so I hope you lovely people can help. I have recently gotten back into exercising and specifically weight lifting and want to finally fix a problem that has plagued me all my life. Basically i was born with most of my right hand missing, google crab hand on google images and the literal first image is basically my right hand. 

The crux of the issue is that my hand ended up smaller than my wrist (I go into more detail below). But in essence any time I pull anything of weight the adaptive aid I use now goes  flying. 

&#x200B;

This has meant I have had very limited gripping strength and no palm to speak of which makes gripping exercises incredibly hard e.g. anything with a lat machine. I have an aid from the company Active Hands which works decently for any pushing exercises (although due to the small wrist size i cant do barbells without causing a decent amount of pain. This is due to all the weight on a tiny wrist area) ,however as my wrist is larger than my hand and gets sweaty mid workout, anytime I attach weight to the aid and pull it invariably ends up flying away from my hand, sometime with hilarious consequences (literally went flying across the gym yesterday when I again attempted the lat machine).

As such any advice, recommendations for alternative products or alternative back exercises you all could recommend to get over obstacle I would very very much appreciate.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Deformed hand smaller than wrist, can't grip naturally and aid goes flying off hand when I pull. Need alternate option for doing any pulling e.g. back, tricep, etc... exercises. 

Update: pic of hand

Goal: gain as much muscle mass as possible.

Question: Over the course of 3, 6, 12 months, will there be a difference in appearance between someone who does an at-home routine with basic dumbbells/bands vs a “body-weight only” routine? Will it be negligible if you work just as hard?

Assuming the same high calorie diet.

"I have had a good search of online articles and reddit forums and as far as I can tell, exerting yourself as much as possible for shorter periods of time as opposed to less exertion over a longer period of time does not differ much in terms of the benefits of the exercise, apart from some extra testosterone for men (which doesn’t apply to me) and a slight increase to the benefit to the cardiovascular system.

I ask this because many people who are interested in exercise seem to say that feeling the “burn” and really pushing yourself is really important and insinuate the benefit is far greater this way. 

Can anyone more knowledgeable shed any light on this for me?","fitness,fitness"

"What my question is exactly is difficult to explain but I will do my best.  

I played competitive water polo for a long time, and during conditioning, we would do training drills to increase our ability to hold our breath. Things like hypoxic breathing sets, underwater laps, etc. 

Now, I understand why this was something we trained to do. One reason being when you swim, you go faster the less you breathe and lift your head to take breaths. Also, it was great conditioning as it was much more tiring to do laps and sprints while you were more out of breath. 

My question is, now that I’m not a competitive swimmer /water polo player, would breath training and similar drills be effective and beneficial still. I know they’d help my overall  conditioning. But aside from just being more tired when I hold my breath when I swim, what could other benefits be? Is putting your body at an oxygen deficit for reasonably short periods of time beneficial in any way? 

I can easily swim a 25 yard lap under water still even though it’s been years since I had to do it for training. And I find it relaxing when I do hop in a pool for a workout. But are there benefits I could still see if I’m not necessarily focused on doing it to be faster as a swimmer or a better conditioned swimmer? 

Thanks!


EDIT: damn I didn’t expect to see all of these comments when I came back to Reddit. Thank you all so much for your helpful responses.

"I'm 19, 173cm (5'6') and i believe around 60 - 65kg (132 lbs-143 lbs) . I am planning to join millitary in April-May hopefully and I need to get my body in check.

My current workout program consists of:

2km (1.24 miles) run,

15-20 minute rest,

get down and do pushups until I can't,

rest 10 minutes,

Bicep curls with 20kg plate, until I hate plateu of 4 reps per set and I get bored.

Next week I'll start doing negative pullups since I need 5 to get in and I can't do a single one, yet.

I do these exercises 3 days on, one day off and have been taking that pace for the last 5-6 weeks.

Basically, going back 5 weeks I couldn't do a single pushup and now today I can pump out 10 pushups, rest 3 minutes then pump out 9, and then i hit a plateu  after my 6th set of around 4 pushups.

Usually after my 6th set of pushups I am just able to do 4 pushups then I rest 3 minutes, do 4 pushups and not a single more, rest 3 minutes, do 4 pushups again and I can do that for about 10 or so sets with just 4 pushups.

My goals are 70 pushups

15 pullups

2,4km (1.50 mile) run in 9 minutes.

&#x200B;

I recently found out about this subreddit and the FAQ suggested 'grease the groove' to increasing the amount of repetitions one can do in a row.

**Please tell me if I understood correctly, basically if i'm working from home, every hour i should get up, go down and, if my max reps are 15 pushups, i should get down, do 8 pushups, get back to work, wait an hour or two, get down again, do 8 pushups, get back to  work and so on AND i should be doing that basically every day?**

&#x200B;

And this should work with any exercise, ie, pullups, sit ups? Pardon my English, I'm european.  Thank you.","fitness,fitness"
"I’ve noticed that most of the largest, most muscular guys I see at the gyms tend to use a surprisingly small range of motion when they lift. I was under the impression that full ROM is optimal for hypertrophy, but I’m beginning to question that belief. It seems like most of the guys doing partials with heavy weight are much larger than most of the guys doing full ROM with moderate weight.

"Hey all!

I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner.

The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it.

My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max).

My questions are:

1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work?
2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process?
3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change.
4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)?
5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much?

In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5. 

Thanks everyone!","fitness,fitness"

"Hey guys, I have been looking to get into sled pulling or a variation of that (pulling a heavy tire). My two options for doing so are a sled harness with areas to clip onto the front and back and a pulling belt, which can easily be switched from front to back. Which do you think would be better? Which would provide a better overall workout? I am also concerned about spinal compression when pulling forward with the harness. Is that a valid concern?

You're tracking calories to a 500 deficit, and you steadily lose 1 lb/week. But then your weight loss stalls. For 15~ days, your weight hovers around the same number, going up half a pound, down half a pound. No progress. You wonder, do I need to adjust my intake again?

"I'm aware that it is very difficult to make strength gains during cutting but I'm not sure about regaining strength I had in the past. Here's my situation:

In the UK we had lockdown for a few months. As I felt like I had too much body fat I decided to cut and used calisthenics to substitute for weights. Fast forward 4 months and the gyms opened. I have lost significant strength, now after the previous lockdown I regained  strength quickly but I was not cutting.

"I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!). 

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true. 

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous).

"For 10 years I have been between bodybuilding and powerlifting. The years have worn on me and now I find myself enjoying mostly cardio and some lifting exercises to maintain health. I do about an hour of Low intensity or moderate intensity cardio per day. Some days are higher intensity.

I'd like to get into more functional training but the lifts I have found online haven't really been great for me. I have been doing a lot more active stretching, pull ups, push ups, sled pushes and core work. Any specific recommendations on where to find more?","fitness,fitness"
"According to this video I am linking below (and basically every online information source I could find), higher volume/lower intensity equals hypertrophy and higher intensity/lower volume equals strength without too much hypertrophy. From what I gather, in order not to gain too much mass you should also avoid going on a calorie surplus and be either on maintenance or a deficit. Can you however train some groups for hypertrophy and others just for strength at the same time (while on maintenance)? For example, if I did high volume/lower intensity arm and shoulder workouts and high intensity/lower volume abdominal workouts, would this give me bulky arms and shoulders and a trim but strong abdomen? Or you have to follow the same approach for the entire body?

"#Link to Article - [THE SECRET IS PATIENCE](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-secret-is-patience.html)

Once again, /u/mythicalstrength has his finger on the pulse and puts words to some things I've been ruminating on as well.  

The tldr should be pretty obvious: big changes in this space take time and persistence, but our modern day lifestyles and the marketing gimmicks that hack into them don't set up the uninitiated to be prepared for this stark reality.  

To add something of my own to the conversation, this lack of patience also seems to rob people of the satisfaction of the short term results they have achieved:  

""I've lost 16lb in 3 months and I'm not at my goal weight, where am I going wrong?""   

""I've been lifting for a year and despite improving my lifts greatly, my quads don't look like this professional bodybuilder's, what am I missing?""  

These people have achieved very real and very important successes, but because they have been blinded by the 'instant results' hoopla, they've denied themselves the gratification of this particular instant.  

We're all gonna make it, gang.  It's just gonna take time, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate successes along the way, too.","fitness,fitness"

Many people believe that if you get lean before you start a bulk, you'll gain muscle more efficiently. Their reasoning often relates to concerns about insulin sensitivity: if you have more body fat, your insulin sensitivity will be lower, so you'll gain more fat and less muscle in a calorie surplus. However, the evidence for this concept is surprisingly thin and shaky.

Hi! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!,"fitness,fitness"
The company I work for is giving out $300 a quarter to put towards physical/mental health and I’m curious what other people would put it towards!,"fitness,fitness"
"So, I just ended Barbell Medicine's conditioning program and I got curious into what is *conditioning.*

I found out after a few days of research that conditioning is extremely important for any kind of athlete since it builds work capacity, basically how much work can you do. The more work can you do, the higher intensity, frequency and volume you can have. Also it will impact directly your recovery which, again, means more possible work. Awesome, right?

By digging deeper and deeper I found out that it also increase **Lactate Threshold**, builds **Oxygen Capacity**, increases VO₂ MAX which is important since this increase:

* maximum oxygen uptake in all muscle fibers
* capillaries to all muscle fiber types
* ability to slow the build-up of waste products (not just lactic acid) that will slow down your performance
* and, also, last but not least cardiovascular health.

Now, this all is amazing, and we get to my question(s) here:

1. Why conditioning is not more pushed between athletes?
2. How much can you really improve your genetic set point on VO₂ MAX, work capacity et cetera?
3. Why VO₂ MAX and other factors are still considered controversial in terms of health indication? By looking at some metas, especially since everything I found before
4. Also by looking at most papers, research is mostly done on youth and the impact of aerobic and anaerobic training in early age. Why is that? Is it possible to close the gap in adults too and reach an incrementation of work capacity, lactate threshold et cetera like the gap between strenght-speed and speed-strenght?

"Hey all! For reference, I am a squash player. The length of the ""track"" is 10meters so every 10m i need to turn the sled around. So one ""round"" is 10m

I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. 

My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder.  If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. 

So my question is, do  you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. 

Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls? Like instead of pushing, you go backwards.


Tl;dr: how to program sled push

Edit 2: After reading the comments I will adding the sled push to build leg endurance and not speed. I will be cheking the sprint subreddit for that","fitness,fitness"
"Was doing wall sits and was just shocked how a max hold can smoke the quads harder than multiple reps of squats can. I started thinking about how doing negatives and static holds helped me achieve 10+ pull-ups when I previously couldn’t do a single rep.


How exactly do static exercises build muscle? I understand it’s time under tension. Old school ideology is high reps = muscle building, low reps = strength. I know that doesn’t exactly translate today, as strength builds muscle and endurance builds strength, but it still holds true to some extent.


So in theory, is a wall sit more akin to doing high rep leg press(or some other quad isolation). Or is it more like doing one max strength rep? Could someone technically do nothing but wall sits and build massive quads?

EDIT: lots of downvotes on this. I wasn’t suggesting this is as a substitution or even a thought about incorporating them into my workout. It was purely just a passing curiosity about the mechanism of action.","fitness,fitness"

"I have been writing up a workout plan set for 12 weeks and it is my goal to stick with it and finish the whole thing. My secondary goal is to work in a caloric deficit and attempt to maintain as much muscle mass as I can. My tertiary goal, and the focus of this post, is to use single-limb exercises, preferably with dumbbells when possible, in order to challenge muscles that stabilize those movements and ensure that each limb is getting equal attention and weight.

I have 2 questions that arose while writing this plan:

1. Is this method actually achieving what my goals are? Does this method make a reasonable difference with my routine?

2. Is it possible to use a similar dumbbell-centric, single-limb, plan for building mass? Would it be in my best interest to switch from one-arm dumbbell bench press to Barbell Bench Press?

It is totally possible I am missing some fundamental information. This is the first ever weightlifting plan I have written. I may be willing to share what I have written thus far.

Thanks!

EDIT: as mentioned in the comments my plan is an adaptation of the Frankoman's Dumbbell Only Split replacing overhead tricep exercises with cable tricep pull-downs to accommodate a shoulder injury I had a couple years ago under the advisement of my doctor. I've also made a couple other adjustments like replacing dumbbell squats with barbell squats, replacing dumbbell stiff-leg deadlifts with Standard Barbell Deadlifts. Other than that most other things are about the same.

TL;DR: I'm essentially asking if I can do a single-limb Variant of Incline Dumbbell Press instead of using both arms to work some stabilizing core muscles. Incline dumbbell press is the first exercise on the first day of Frankoman's plan.","fitness,fitness"

"I’ve recently added 60-degree incline presses to my routine every other week just to prevent boredom. I can put up significantly more weight than with normal (~80 degrees) seated shoulder presses, but it still feels like my shoulders are doing the majority of the work.

I’m wondering, though, does a 60-degree incline offer anything that traditional seated shoulder presses or a 30-degree incline bench can’t also offer (besides variety)? I never see anyone else pressing with a 60-degree incline at the gym and I’m wondering if there’s a reason for that.","fitness,fitness"
"So I'm a total beginner to fitness (especially weight lifting) and haven't even gone to a gym yet, but I'm thinking about my fitnessplan at the moment. I don't want to grow muscles on my upper body, but mostly on my legs and glutes. I would just like to train my back a little for a better posture, but I don't see any reason to train my arms. But then again I'm worried it would look weird if I have a visibly trained lower body but untouched arms. I would want to tighten the muscles in my arms at least but I heard tightening muscles is a myth and I also don't understand what you do differently when you want to tighten muscles in contrast to growing them. Especially if I have to be in a caloric surplus to grow muscles on my legs and glutes, then how can I simultaneously tighten them on different places and not grow them. It would only make sense to me to be in a caloric deficit if you want to tighten muscles. But I have no idea, so please correct me if I'm wrong....","fitness,fitness"

"Hi Reddit, it’s 10th day after I was tested with Covid (yeah, got it on New Year) with mild symptoms. I still have some coughing but otherwise feel much better.

Before it, I was training with different levels of effort for around 2 years and strictly followed bodyweight RR for last 2 months with good progression (from my point of view).

My question is when and how to resume working out. I think it may be an interesting discussion especially with this new variant as a lot of people either already went through this or will go soon. 

Some sources [1] tell that you need to wait at least 10-14 days after all symptoms are gone, but it sounds too harsh to me. Others [2,3] suggest for at least a week (also after all symptoms are gone). But again, minor coughing usually persist pretty long after Covid and I’m not sure if you should wait after it’s completely gone or a week after fever is gone is enough. 

I desperately want to resume these fun activities but afraid of making things worse to me. So, want to know if anyone has some experience/knowledge in returning to fitness after the illnesses. And what is the general rule of thumb of the community (I’m not seeking for a medical advice, just want to discuss with the people here their experience and issues in returning to fitness)

"I'm in my 50s (F) and just started exercising regularly 6 months ago after decades of being sedentary and morbidly obese. I do both strength training and cardio each time I go to the gym, in that order. At first I did the stationary bike for cardio, but about 6 weeks ago I switched to the elliptical (but took a couple of weeks off last month due to covid). For about the first 15 minutes on the elliptical, I'm miserable and I feel like I can barely manage to do it. Then something switches and it feels great and like I could go on for hours. I don't go for hours, but sometimes do spend longer on it than I planned. Is there anything I can do to get to the good part faster? I've considered going more frequently and doing strength and cardio on alternate days instead of doing both each time or going one or two more days just to do the elliptical, but I don't really understand what's happening and how to best direct my efforts towards improving it.","fitness,fitness"
"Article: [https://www.strongerbyscience.com/diet-tracking/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/diet-tracking/)

A common concern is that quantitatively tracking dietary intake may give rise to disordered eating. A new randomized controlled trial casts doubt on this idea, fueling optimism for people who want to more actively manage their diet without unintended consequences.

**Key Points:**

1. In the presently reviewed study[^(1)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34427188/), 200 female college students who did not closely monitor their diet were randomly assigned to one month of diet tracking with MyFitnessPal or no intervention (control).
2. The researchers did not observe significant negative effects on eating disorder risk, anxiety, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, quality of life, eating behaviors, physical activity, screen time, or other forms of weight-related self-monitoring. 
3. For individuals without a current or previous eating disorder diagnosis, tracking with a diet app did not negatively impact psychological outcomes or increase eating disorder risk. On the other hand, the mere act of tracking did not significantly improve other health-related behaviors.","fitness,fitness"

"I M(28)(5’11) had a massive health kick at the start of the year and thankfully it has gone quite well. Toward the end of last year (November?) I was hovering around 85kg and badly over weight. Just last week I have weighed in at 74kg after taking up walking and picking my weight training back up. 

I have been doing weight training for 7ish years with mixed results, I have a decent body now but nothing particularly impressive. This is now the 3rd time that I have done a big cut and I’m tired of see-sawing as a result of motivation. I would much rather stay at this weight or even lower (70kg) for the coming years. 

My question is for those who have made this change or lost a significant amount of weight and kept it off for a very long time, what keeps you going and what do you do to stay focused and not let work/life/social get in the way? I’m already having trouble with friends pressuring me to drink after I’ve told them I’ve more or less given it up for health reasons etc. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your advice there’s too many comments to respond to all of them but I’m reading through them all slowly ❤️","fitness,fitness"
"Hey guys, I've been working out pretty regularly (2-3x a week) for almost 8 months now. I recently added 20 mins of cardio at the end of each workout. I keep reading about people using exercise to relieve stress, and that it reduces their stress levels and improves their mental health in general life, even not just after exercise.

However, I have barely felt any effect on my mental health at all. I can't find anyone else experiencing this and I feel like I'm going crazy. I do feel good after exercise most of the time, and I have a bit more energy to do chores and stuff. But on a day-to-day basis I feel the same as I did prior to exercising.

Is there anyone else experiencing similar feelings?

**EDIT**:

Thanks for all your responses, it's been hard to keep up. A lot of helpful tips and perspectives here. I'm clearly not the only one experiencing this, and I have probably also been misinterpreting what people mean when they say they ""feel better"" from exercising. Lifting was way more YMMV and nuanced than I previously thought in terms of how it affects peoples moods!","fitness,fitness"

"Hey guys!

This is the first fitness community I’ve joined, Reddit or otherwise. I’ve got a question concerning measuring gains and changing calories accordingly. I’ve been lifting for about 4 months now and following an old Joe Weider guide book that came with the weight bench my dad got a couple decades back. I doubt it’s got the best exercise routines based on how much exercise science has evolved, but I’m sticking to it for now because I’ve learned the exercises well enough to do proper form.

Anywho, I’m always seeing people talk about increasing your calorie intake when your gains start decreasing. My question is: what sort of change in gains are we talking about that quantify bumping your intake by X calories? Should I be taking standard muscle measurements once a month and comparing them to previous months? For some context, I’m 5’ 10”, 166lbs, around 11.5% BF last time I used calipers. I’ve decided against bulking and cutting, preferring the more organic way of approaching a better physique. I lift three times a week, eating at 2600 calories on lifting days and maintenance (2200) on off days.

Please let me know if you need more context.
Thanks!

Edit: Thanks so much for all of the positive feedback! This seems like a great community of people.

Edit 2: It seems that I may be hindering my progress by eating at maintenance on my rest days. I’m going to switch back to bulking and cutting based on the solid advice you guys have given me. I’m grateful that you guys have helped me to clarify the misconceptions I’ve had about building muscle.","fitness,fitness"

"I'm male, 33y/o, about 5""8.5...been lifting for a couple of years.

Using mostly Greyskull LP/SS and the popular Reddit PPL program, I got my stats to these calculated 1RMs (never actually tested, just calculated on [exrx.net](https://exrx.net) based off of my strongest sets)

Body weight: 155-160lbs

DL - 399lbs

Squat - 317lbs

Bench - 215lbs

OHP - 137lbs

I'm interested in building more strength and muscle and love the simplicity and elegance of 5/3/1 (would probably do the BBB variant) - just wondering if I'm passing up on quicker gains by switching to it too quickly? It's getting harder and very taxing to try to progress linearly on a Greyskull/Reddit PPL model of just adding 5lbs to my 5rm each workout.

Was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for what program they might try if they were me? Or if 5/3/1 is a reasonable choice?

(My bench seems particularly sad and the thought of only moving it up 5lbs every 3-4 weeks seems inadequate..but maybe I'm just being impatient.)

"Hi all!

Just looking for a bit of advice really.

I’ve been off and on with gyms for the past few years and then when covid hit, really got back into going to the gym again, messy breakup, big focus on myself!

My new partner is really into CrossFit, so I thought I would give it a go, and fell in love aswell. My main concern about a standard gym was me not actually taking the time and effort to do any cardio, having asthma I was always scared too, but doing this has pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Anyway, the coaches have great WODs programmed in and do to Oly session on the weekends. But I really miss doing some good old strength training to go alongside it. I was doing a PPL at the time, but the CrossFit gym doesn’t have all the same equipment so I thought I would just focus mainly on the CrossFit and metcon. 

Now I want to get my strength back to similar/better level so I’ve been looking at strength programs again, but I don’t want to spend hours in the gym as each class with the warm up is roughly 45/60 mins. 

Can anyone help or may if had a similar situation in the past and what they did to have CF and a strength program side by side? I was looking at simple 5/3/1 but wasn’t too sure if it was enough.

Thanks all!


TLDR- I’m looking for a strength program  (5/3/1-PPL - just on a faster scale)to go side by side with programmed CrossFit workouts.","fitness,fitness"

"Hello,

New to the sub. So, I apologize if this was brought up on here often. 

I exercise at a boutique fitness place that is quite intense. I usually burn around 800-1100 calories per hour class. I’ve been doing this for 4 months now and it’s starting to get me down.

I take 3 classes a week but I’m not recovering. I thought I was just I was just over doing it and decided to take a week off to recover. But when I returned I was just as fatigued as before. I have trouble getting out of bed. Walking up a flight of stairs is unbearable. 

I’m taking the correct vitamins and protein. I get 8-9 hours of sleep. I well hydrated. I even drink Pedialyte occasionally to make sure I have all my electrolytes.

Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Is this common?

Edit: I’m 280 lbs 6”4. Haven’t lost any weight since starting. But I believe I gained muscle mass","fitness,fitness"
"If fast twitch muscle fibers are for hard efforts (like sprinting), and slow twitch fibers are for efforts like running marathons...

Why is it that you can increase your marathon time by running 400m intervals?

I've been training short fast intervals for a lot of my running career and just realized that I don't know how/why this adaptation crosses both barriers.

Same for deadlifting, I've done the Dan John 50 Squat rep challenge (225lbs) twice, failing the first time, and the only difference was working to increase my strength through 3x5 and Dynamic efforts across 3 months.

I know these things work by experience, but it doesn't seem to link up with what I actually have read.

How does this work? Are there any research or case studies to back this up?

Thanks for the help and look forward to the insight.


Edit: I didn't make my question very clear. I'm well versed in the application, I'm also well versed in the dogma on the topic. I'm looking for if there is more in depth research or case studies or published theories that specifically layout how this effect happens.","fitness,fitness"

"Marathon is the reaper marathon in south carolina, july 17th. 

https://runsignup.com/Race/SC/Seneca/CarolinaReaper

I've been training by running long periods of time consecutively in the given time frame-- last week I ran 15 consecutive miles at like a 13:30 pace. But the catch with this race is that the 26.2 miles are broken into 2.6 mile chunks, and every runner has 45 minutes to complete a given chunk. **If you finish early, you can't start the next chunk, but you have to wait until the next chunk starts.**


My questions are:

a) should I train in the manner the race is being run? or if I can run x miles consecutively at a given pace is it safe to say I can run that same amount broken up even faster?

b) what should I do for these breaks besides hydrate? stretch? sit? jog? walk? I want to stay loose but also staying loose for 8 hours is a long time to be loose

c) any other thoughts?



e: janitor dm'd me, per their request my goal is just to finish","fitness,fitness"

"I've seen a few posts about this but not too many answers. I'm a generally happy, calm person, not depressed but a bit prone to anxiety. I've noticed that over the last few years, exercise has gradually made me feel more anxious afterwards. Especially cardio (running or dance) or anything strenuous (like heavy weights), but even with more easy going workouts (yoga or a hike), I'll feel it. It seems to trigger an adrenaline or cortisol response, which lasts for a whiiiile. It makes sense to me, I think my body just assumes we're running from a tiger and it triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. My body feels stressed out after, for at least a few hours, if not the rest of the day, and I feel like my brain goes a bit fuzzy.

I feel fantastic when I'm exercising, just not so hot after, and it's really putting me off exercising at all. If I don't exercise, I feel happy and calm throughout the day. I try to make sure I'm eating a good diet, whole foods and enough calories. I don't eat sugar really, or take any stimulants. It doesn't seem to be common, but I see a few people on here share the same problem.

Things I've tried:  
Cooling down slowly  
Trying to not raise my heart rate too high  
Breathing exercises to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system afterwards

If anyone has had this problem and found a solution, I'd love to hear it. Or ideas from anyone else! If you've made it this far, thanks!!

"Hi everyone! I'm 23 and this year I've started competitive shooting in IPSC (for the US folks is like USPSA). The past year I've been focusing on loosing weight training with a personal trainer and doing mainly calisthenics, but now the cost of training for IPSC really took the budget I got and, because I'm not really a fit kind of person I was looking for something I could do at home. Do some of you train specifically for practical shooting? Do you have routines or something I can follow online, like videos or something? 
Basically a match consists (obviously) of shooting, so using a minimal grip strength, then there's a lot of sprinting, squatting while shooting in awkward positions, and sometimes ducking and moving through tunnels. So mainly is a lot of cardio work, the match are a some of stages that doesn't last more than 30/40 seconds at worst. 
The idea is to get faster and develop a good coordination in explosive movements. I don't really need to get a ton of muscles to manage recoil, contrary to what most people think, I just need to be more athletic. 
Sorry if is a dumb question but I really don't know much about, and tbh I just don't want to waste time and energy in some routine not useful or to get hurt with dumb exercises found randomly online. Any suggestions are welcomed!
P.s.: sorry for mistakes if there are, English is not my first language and thank anyone in advance!","fitness,fitness"
"What are people's thoughts on using a heavier-than-recommended Bulgarian bag?

It's generally used as a strength-endurance-cardio tool that is centred around lower back and core strength in the transverse plane, along with grip and shoulder endurance.

Usually you see the bag used for 10-12 reps, switch exercise, another 10-12 reps, repeat, through several exercises without rest.

I see this as something akin to doing barbell complexes, which are great, but not necessarily conducive to pure strength/power, and more of a strength endurance thing bordering on cardio/HIIT.

So what if one were to use a bag heavier than that recommended, sticking within a range where 4-8 reps would be max effort, then taking a break, then repeating for another 3-4 sets? It's normally recommended than a reasonably athletic male should start with a 12kg bag, then move to a 17kg then 22kg eventually. But I'm thinking of a scenario where one would begin with a 22kg and move potentially to a 30kg.

I guess one could also slow down the movements somewhat, focusing less on the skill of the movement and more on strength/time under tension. Another parallel; heavy kettlebells where movements such as the overhead press are performed seated and with strict form.

This matter is interesting to me because I don't see it explored much anywhere, and it is an incredibly versatile piece of equipment, and I love the core stability benefits offered in that transverse plane which is something that isn't targeted by conventional weight lifting programmes.

Thanks.","fitness,fitness"

"I've started the RR a few weeks ago, and have been gradually learning about form, and variations and progressions to try to figure out where to start each exercise.  The explanations here are great, but seeing the exercises in action really helps.

One thing I found in looking at the many training videos on youtube is that most of them are made by these incredibly muscular guys who can do every exercise perfectly.  This is so far from where I am as a beginner, though its important to see them being done right.

So I enjoyed this video which shows a pretty normal looking guy in his messy little apartment doing the RR over the course of a year.  It shows him doing it well, doing it badly and falling, his setbacks, his progressions, how he adapts the RR for his limited equipment and space, and what he did wrong and learned along the way.

I thought I'd share this for the other beginners like me who need someone to relate to.

"Hello, I've been seeing strength gains in my pullups and dips, but it's not helping me with endurance at lower weight. For instance I started doing dips with 35 lbs a few months ago I would be able to 7-8 in a row but in the next set I could only do 4-5 sets. I assumed the problem was my strength so I started doing more strength training, and stopped hypertrophy training for approximately 2 months. My 1 rep max now on dips is 95lbs and 40lbs with pullups. However im going back to the lighter weight and still hitting the same reps. The funny thing is though the lighter weight does indeed feel alot lighter then it used to, but my endurance hasn't changed at all. Do any of you know what's wrong, I know alot of solutions, but I can't find a solution for this problem at all. If you know what I can do to fix this please let me know.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm on vacation right now, and I keep eating where ever we go, but all I have is my body because I don't have anywhere to hang my rings.  And I'm officially bulking for a few days only because I will not say no to food.

Insert isometrics.  I know by itself it can make you strong and grow muscle if you repeat the effort of 3-10 seconds on different positions. I.e. pull ups or pulls/push ups or dips or pike or handstand/ squats and it's variations.

So I decided to try it out.

So I'd do first 15 s of each major body part.  Squats resting on the wall, you can do a horse stance, then pull ups or rows, hanging making sure to squeeze the late and back and any other body part you want done, then on dips/push ups or pike or variations, you hold the position without locking out. 90° thing.

By doing this, you get an easy body weight strength training.  And you can do it in a circuit.

After one circuit of this, I do burpees of 15s.

I then do these two circuits repeatedly.

Takes around 10-15 minutes a day.  Very fun and quick.

Warning:

Be sure to use stable and strong immovables so you don't destroy stuff as you travel.

"Hi, I'm 17 and recently re-enrolled into public school. I'm around 6' 1'' and believe I weigh around 238 pounds (can't remember my weight, but I think this is close). I don't have a job and practically sit all day, even before school. I'm not very active asides from walking around at school everyday. I eat out on a daily basis due to living with my father who doesn't know how to cook (neither do I) so I don't exactly eat healthy to say the least (I also only eat once a day and tend to consume quite a lot of food during that meal), although I do try to fit in veggies whenever I can, though those times are few and far between. Needless to say I don't have access to very many healthy food options and don't exercise at all, which needs to change. I'm unhappy with where I'm currently at and desperately want to change so I can be healthier and finally be happy in my own skin, maybe even socialize for once (don't now due to me being embarrassed). I have no idea where to start and have absolutely no knowledge on healthy eating nor exercising and have had trouble finding information in the past. I was wondering if anyone can help me find some good options to help me lose some weight fairly quickly?

"29M, 180 lbs

I'm someone who exercises 3 times a week, but I really just do exercises that I find here and there for 20 mins at a pace that gets my muscles exhausted, gets the heart pumping, and breaks a sweat. I found one in the sidebar that I'd been doing a while:  pushups, lunges, rows, shoulder taps. Is this still considered a decent quick body routine? I'll sometimes switch this up and throw in more abs or arms exercises.

Anyways, I have access to 2 Bowflex dumbbells that I can vary the weight on. I'm looking for a routine that uses only bodyweight and the dumbbells so that I can workout from my apartment. I'm also willing to get resistance bands.

My primary goals are to overall look and be fit, strengthen muscles joints to support sedentary work life and hobbies, and build foundation so that I'm not hurting when I'm older. I guess I appear fit enough, but I'm not necessarily gaining muscle, which is fine as long as I'm healthy.

Generally my questions are...

1) Is my current routine good enough to support my goals?

2) What exercises can I add with my limitations to achieve more?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I've been training for about a year now. Started with 0 pullups and 12 sloppy pushups. Now a year later my max pullups(if I'm not focusing on a strict tempo) is ~13 reps(haven't tested in a few months so id imagine it's a bit higher), but with pushups it's now a grand total of 15 reps. Three whole reps over the course of a year. I don't really understand how this has happened, my primary pulling movement is of course pullups, and primary pushing movement is pushups as dips irritate my shoulders.

I know at the very least, my form has definitely gotten better with pushups, but surely after almost a year I'd expect to do more than 3 reps than I originally could. Especially given that pushups aren't the most challenging exercise in the world? Looking in the mirror I can very clearly see way more chest definition than I had before so I know I've been working my chest, but still the numbers don't really make sense to me.

Height ~175cm, ~70kgs and 22m. Im happy to dm anyone a video of my most recent pullups and pushups to give me an idea of what my form is like. I aim for a 3 sec eccentric and a 1 sec pause at the bottom/top for each exercise.

"Hi all, espec.those who procrastinate or have difficulty with choosing a routine or sticking to it. My take :
I started more than a couple of times...Ive got a lot of books.....

My AHA moment was yesterday....I ve got a chronic depression and Borderline Pers.disorder and choosing or sticking to something is what I found hard with BW.

But

After starting 2y ago but 3 times stopping/ not going to the gym ( anxiety and/ or Covid) I did this and maybe it will help someone else?

I did not know if I would loose weight And gain muscle / how to choose a routine,so I began with this: 1300kcal/ a day and once a week not. And Every day I go down on the floor and do pushups. Perfect form,5 times and first only 1 or 2, now 7 eacht time.
Mostly 2 in the morning, 3 after noon.

I just know I need to do this 5times. Thats it.


After 3 months my hips stick out. I see some abs. My arms are muscular  and my back and chest too. I lost for my feeling 2kgs, but weigh 1 kg less so maybe even gained muscles?I just see result and now I incorporate my pullups/ dead hangs/ active hangs. 5 times a day. Nothing on sundays. 
Each day I try to walk 1 or 2 hours  / 10.000 -15000 steps.
Thats it.

Now I see I did this and it has results, I am going to up it more.
Maybe even 3 times a week a circuit. Or not.

But these small steps, just 5 times laying on the floor and pushing up, changed me.

I also don’t have access to a gym, so I’m using adjustable dumbells at home, along with bodyweight workouts, like pushups, dips. I’m going to add planks and other bodyweight only ab workouts, but I want to get into a routine first. 

My intention of doing 100ish pushups everyday is to get into a routine of working out (I have adhd and struggle with consistency without routine.) Also, I’ve read that 100 pushups everyday is a great to start building up strength. Lastly, having a tangible goal of 100 pushups to do everyday will hopefully help with motivation and momentum with other workouts too. 

Furthermore, I know that the number of 100 pushups isn’t really important. I’ve been more focusing on doing as much as I can throughout the day. I’ve been doing mostly wall pushups, but trying to do 20 or so floor pushups for variation and training. Are wall pushups effective? Or should I try to build up to more floor pushups? I’m using knees for floor pushups right now. I also can’t do regular floor pushups because they hurt my wrists, so I’ve been using a bar and in the past I’ve used my fists. 

I would love to hear any tips/ advice, but my main question is how pushups everyday will interfere/ affect with needed muscle rest for growth with other workouts. 

Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello. I’m taking an agility test at the end of December. This test will consist of a timed run, and push ups/sit ups for reps. 

I’m a fat guy, but dropping in the right direction. 6’4” 28YOM 260lbs. Over the past year I have lost almost 70 pounds with aggressive diet and exercise. I typically warm up with kettle bell swings and Turkish Get Ups, followed by body weight squats, sit ups, rows, and push-ups. I normally do a full body routine, 3-4 days a week. I also run for about 30 minutes 3-4 days a week. I loose an average of 2lbs a week.

I am progressing well with running and sit ups, but I am severely behind on my push up numbers. Following progressions, I went from physically not being able to do a push up, to being able to complete a few in good form. I am trending in the right direction, just not as quickly as I’d like.

My question is, being that I have a scheduled test, should I stop my full body routine and ONLY focus on runs, sit ups, and push ups? At least until the end of the year? Or is it better to keep up what I’ve been doing and hope for the best?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Tl;Dr: Is there a specific way to call the side aspect of calisthenics done on the floor in a flowing manner, like GMB or Animal Flow?

I started my fitness journey several years ago as an overweight person. I always felt like bodyweight fitness was the way to go, but I sincerely couldn't pull anything in my sad condition. Instead, I passionately started powerlifting, then moved to kettlebells at the beginning of the pandemic. I am now so many pounds lighter (30kg/65lbs) and younger as a 40yo dad than I have ever been. Never really cared about hypertrophy anyway.

I have discovered Animal Flow several months ago, then moved to GMB that I absolutely love. Finishing GMB Elements at the moment. While still a beginner, I have good mobility and sufficient strength to progress rapidly and pull tricks I am humbly pretty proud of.

Therefore, I would like to explore this aspect of calisthenics further: flowing, crawling, having fun on the floor and moving from one pose to the next in an ""effortless"" manner. How should I search for new ideas on the interweb? Calisthenics as a keyword brings a lot of stuff with rings and implements that I am less interested in.

Also, I would be very grateful if you fine people could recommend YT channels and stuff around what I described.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I have recently just finished a workout program from a calisthenics athlete and was able to unlock the muscle up, frontlever, one arm push up(although form is questionable), one arm row and at least 5 secs free-standing handstand.

I'm now trying to train for the one arm pullup, full planche and handstand pushup and these are the workouts I do in a week.

Mon: 1×15m Handstand routine; 4×3-8r One arm negative pullups with bands; 4×3-8r tuck planche press

Tue: 1×15m Handstand routine; 4×3-8r Archer pullup; 4×3-8r tuck planche pushup (any exercise to replace this exercise would be much appreciated)

Wed: 4×3-8r Frontlever pulls; 4×3-8r Wall handstand pushup; 4×3-8r leg workout(probably squats, thinking of incorporating weight)

Fri: 1×15m Handstand Routine; Frontlever hold 4×5-10s; 4×10-15s Tuck planche hold

Sat: 4×8-15r One arm row; 4×3-8r One arm pushup; 4×3-8r leg workout(haven't decided on one yet but suggestions would be appreciated).

Is this a viable workout and if it is not, what should I change?

"Hey everyone, I was really struggling with handstand and it's progressions. I wanted to do handstand push ups as soon as I got a decent handstand (around 20 seconds). The problem was the exercise selection. Should I do wall handstand push ups or incline pike handstand push ups, or head straigth into handstand push up negatives.   


I just tried different this and achieved my first handstand push around a year ago. The first clean rep right around 9 months ago. I struggled a lot with getting reps in and my max to this day is 4 reps (also after a 6 months bulk).

"Hi all.

Been on a fitness journey the last two months and looking for some advice.My main goal at the moment is to lose weight. Currently skinny fat but have lost around 5kg in the past 8 weeks. While doing around 4 sessions of cardio a week and eating at a caloric deficit i have also been incorporating some bodyweightfitness to try and achieve body recomposition. Everyday i do either arms; back or abs (always a rest day after every group)I have a question about my current chest / arm workout. It is as follows:

12 x 3 Push-ups (elbow out)10 x 3 Push-ups (elbows inward)8 x 3 Diamond push-ups8 x 3 Bicep curl14 x 3 Lateral raisesI take a minute of rest between every set, 2 minutes between each exercise, try to focus on form and try to slow down each rep to 4 seconds to increase time under tension. I also go to failure on the last rep of every set for each exercise.

Over the course of the last two months i have made various changes to my workouts after watching calisthenics videos or general fitness videos. I'm wondering whether or not i am doing too many push-up variations in my current workout. My chest does burn like hell after the workout but wondering if i should stick to just one type of push-up and incorporate another exercise instead. If anyone has any thoughts that would be appreciated.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I want to have a routine that I can keep doing for the rest of my life. I'm 6'2"", 130 lb, and in my early 20s.

I have lots of free time these days, but I'll surely get busier in the future. This is why I don't like doing the recommended routine, and would instead prefer a split routine, where I'd be exercising up to half an hour a day.

I already take a walk (~1 hour) every day and go for a run (every 3 days or so). I'm thinking of working my upper body and core in a single day; legs, glutes, back, and shoulders the next day. I believe I can keep doing this with no rest days, so I can exercise all the body parts I listed about 3 times a week.

How does this routine sound? I'm worried running will make me too tired for legs exercise, but I can't see anything wrong with it otherwise. I can obviously switch the days of core and back/shoulders exercises.

Someone was kind enough to provide me with the routine below but it's mostly for upper body, so I can't stick with it.

```
3 sets with 60 seconds in between ever set and 120 seconds in between each round (notated by letters A-C) of A) 5x knee pushups, B1) 8x diamond incline pushups, B2) 8x wall pushups, C1) 10 second pushup hold (at the bottom of the pushup position), C2) 45 second plank, C3) 8x each side shoulder taps

"hi guys, long time lurker but first time posting. as the title reads, i’m looking for exercises to strengthen my hip flexors, because i notice that they click when i do movements like mountain climbers, so i suspect that they may be quite weak. also looking for movements to strengthen my back, as i’ve noticed that it’s also pretty weak. 

over the year i’ve come to build a full body routine that targets my needs, and i’ve seen some sweet muscle growth (noob gains really kicked in fast, i very quickly couldn’t fit into my jeans anymore!) but have failed to properly target my hip flexors and back. 

any help is much appreciated!


**EDIT:** i should have mentioned this earlier, but the clicking in my hips is *very* uncomfortable. it’s not something that goes away with stretching or warming up before i exercise. i’ve lived a pretty sedentary life for years up until this point, and so i’m certain that the pain is due to very tight and probably small/atrophied hip flexors.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I'd love to find a copy of it. It was the UK i was in when i got it. Years later, i found a website called 60 minute muscles or something and that had very similar ideas.....can anybody help me?

"Ok, before I got my PR on dips and other stuff, I was doing gtg.  While I had the flu and after, which took roughly a week, I had 2 days of sniffles.

Being healthy really kept the experience light.  And having no fear as I trusted the science that doing exercise and eating healthy reduced all causes of mortality by 3-5x.

So my only warning is don't over do it.  Because you'll get sick if you don't take time to recover.

My adjustment is this every 72 hours, I go to failure exercise.  In between after that training, I just do HIIT burpees.

WIM Hof 30 breathes and burpees helped clear my nose for breathing and the deep breathing allowed me to clear my lungs of stuff, mucus, inside.

So for all of us here who are exercising, we are in the right path.  Also for those who are not taking time to recover. Ease up a bit.  Normally that's fine but there's the flu right now.  So recovery is more important than breaking the body.

Today 83kg, and still 14% bodyfat.  So I'm kind of happy.  Muscle memory is real.

Here's to all of us who believes in exercise, eating healthy, and proper rest.

"Hi all,
I’ve been training calisthenics for about 8 months now, around 6 on some version of the RR (currently doing upper/lower split so I can do more leg volume, but I still generally do 3 on each a week). I’ve been working pistol squats for about a month now and I’m noticing a pretty significant strength imbalance between my two legs on these. 

For example, I can do 5-6 unassisted (or maybe very light assistance towards the end) on my left leg. On my right, I can do maybe one unassisted on the first set but pretty much all subsequent reps/sets, I need at least a partial assist to get back up from the bottom.

I’m not sure if it’s a mobility/ankle strength issue maybe, although I am able to hit full range of motion on both legs even if I can’t get up from it unassisted on the right. I don’t think flexibility is a huge issue though—I’ve always been quite flexible.

Any help/suggestions are much appreciated, thank you!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
" I started the recommended routines a few months ago. I got a question for Anti-Rotation. It has 3 alternatives (banded pallof press, Copenhagen Plank with Movement and ring pall of press).  

 I don't have the power rack or strong pole. I am using my power tower with the band. It can't handle my pull so I have to put the weight plates and etc. My power tower is outside so it's a bit problematic when it rains. Putting the weight plates and etc. is not so convenience for me as well since it makes noise when it fall down or the powertower is not stable.  


Copenhagen Plank with Movement is good but i found it too easy.

"I am confused. I want to get strong hip flexors. When I search for exercises that are supposed to strengthen hip flexor muscles I see videos like:

1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozx6Nl4vivA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozx6Nl4vivA)
2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbmiI4YSdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVbmiI4YSdU)

The thing is, I am confused. Which muscles do hip flexors really constitute of? Aren't quads hip flexors? Then squats and unilateral squats should work, right? Why is it always someone demonstrating as if it is the end of the world and you have to do exercises that old people do? No disrespect, but, I am just confused. Are hip flexors untrainable to gain back strength in a normal way? I don't see weight lifting exercises either.

Don't flag this as a low effort post. This is what I just want to ask.

1. What are hip flexors really?
2. How to make them strong AF?

Edit: I can go that 15 sec test that u/Moon_Knight_ suggested. But I think my hip flexors are weak because when I sit on a chair without armrest I slouch both in the thoracic spine region and my lumbar curvature is gone. Since hip flexors attach to the lumbar spine, I think they are weak. Or is it not?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I was just watching one of my nutrition lectures, and I learned that for us to feel the sensation of being full and getting that 'satisfaction' after eating, leptin must be secreted for it to go to the hypothalamus and bind to the LEP-R receptors. Our body only then recognises this as 'yep that's enough food. We're good.'

I also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. This has the following implication: we need a rise in blood sugar, so that insulin can get released -> secrete a fair amount of leptin -> feel full. On this idea, my lecturer said that ""fats making us fuller"" comes across as a misunderstanding for the most part. Whilst it could keep you full ***after*** you feel the initial 'fullness', but to *actually feel full in the first place,* fats are actually counteractive. This is because fats slow the digestion rate of both proteins and carbs (ie. agents who are capable of spiking blood sugar) and delays insulin secretion, and therefore leptin secretion as well.

And this led onto an important point for those following LCHF/keto approach; for those who don't track their calories and only just 'listen to their body', having such high intake of fat + very limited rise in blood sugar levels, they could actually PUT ON WEIGHT because they have harder time feeling full after they eat!

This was the main takeaway from the lecture though. Any ideas/counterarguments/supporting arguments? I know this sub can be biased towards outshining the benefits whilst neglecting its downsides, but I always like to evaluate the validity of my sources - even reliable ones like university lectures imo.

I wasn't able to train for the last 3 week and now that the first month is over, I'm trying to train but notice I'm not getting to the same rep range as before and my Range of Motion in Pull-Ups are lesser than before and my Ring Dips Range is significantly reduced compared to before.

My current reps have dropped to 8 per set. I can squeeze in one or two more during the first set but if I do so, I'm not able to reach 8 in the subsequent sets.  
I was able to do Archer Ring Dips but now I'm not able to stretch my arm out completely at the top)

Would fencing lunges work the same things as regular lunges? I'm not thinking of performing the fencing lunges explosively like in actual fencing, instead I would perform them at the same pace as regular lunges.

I'm not even a fencer, this lunge just comes more naturally to me. My goal is strength and hypertrophy.

Tourette’s make it difficult for me since I have tics that put stress on my arms, back and neck and I twist nerves easily.

"Since gyms are temporary closed because of omicron, I have recently started doing bodyweight exercise at home but a problem I have is that I have no idea how each bodyweight exercise compares to the weight I am lifting in the gym.

Pull up I have no problem with because it is a regular exercise in my routine but for pushing movement, I find regular push up to be too easy. Assuming regular push up equals to lifting 70% of my bodyweight then it will be 50kg but I have been lifting 80-90kg bench press in the gym. I went on to find harder push up variation and am now doing side-to-side push up. It's harder but I have no idea what weight I am actually lifting.

I am just wondering if there is a list of some kind showing may be for example push up = 70% bw, diamond push up = 30% bw to tricep, side-to-side push up = 90% bw etc so that I can get some numbers to plan my workout in order to get stronger.

"Hi all 

I've seen a lot of people asking for routine creation help and well the responses are pretty much always the same. So heres a general list of standards for a routine that you should try and stick to. This applies for beginners and intermediates as advanced will have more specific needs and goals.

Frequency - train each muscle 1 to 3 times week

Volume - do 5-20 sets per muscle per week 

Intensity - train a few reps from failure or to failure on final sets 

Progression - have a progression system be it to add weight, reps or make the progressions harder

Balance - train at least some vertical pulling, vertical pushing, horizontal pulling, horizontal pushing, knee dominant movement like squats, hip hinge movement like deadlifts.

Purpose - ensure your routine has a purpose and that each exercise you do is aiding that purpose.

Rest - ensure you're resting enough to feel good for the next time you train the same muscle.

Feasible - make sure you're not expecting yourself to go from no training to 6 days a week and that the sessions aren't too grueling and long unless you know that's something you have time for and enjoy.

If your routine has everyone of these it will realistically be an effective routine. So just stick to it for 6-12 weeks and then make small adjustments as you go.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

For example on monday I work chest with 5 exercies let's call them exercises A and on thursday I work 5 chest exercises let's call them exercises B or is it better to work both days same workouts.
2. Second question is how many exercises is enough per muscle group per training? At the moment I'm bulking and when I reach the desired muscle size I will start with cutting phase.

I will be very grateful for any help and any advice","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey,

I \[15M\] been doing calesthenics workouts for around 1-2 years or so.  
I've seen significant progress (at start I wasn't able to do even one pull up, push-up, chin-up  now I can do 14 pull ups, 16 chin ups, and around 30 push-ups) 

I started by just doing these basic stuff every 2 days, until I got stronger and could do reps.  
Now I'm doing an upper-lower body split (2 times a week: abs and legs, and 3 times a week: back, biceps, triceps, chest and some shoulders too)

Since I've only done some pushup variations, pull ups, and some lunges I don't know many good exercises...  
I've tried getting some online but every person says something else and I'm kind of lost...  
Thanks in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey, y'all!

It's been around a year since I started resistance training. It was lifting at first and then I switched over to calisthenics after a couple of months because weights were absolutely no fun for me. And now I am training by combining best of both worlds. The one constant thing across both the worlds was the advice to 'always do the exercise across the full range of motion'.
But last week, I saw our gym's trainer doing half reps just a couple of days before his competition and I immediately thought to myself how the trainer could be doing it so wrong.

But, yesterday I came across this video and I think I understand now why my trainer was doing half reps with light weights and a ton of reps.
[How to Build Muscle with Light Weights by The Bioneer](https://youtu.be/QOT8qn0Ag0w)

Up until now, I have been extremely strict about my form and moving across the entire range of motion for every single calisthenics or weightlifting exercise.  But, I wanna incorporate half reps into my training and give this a shot. The video doesn't tell you how to do it.
Could anyone of you with the knowledge tell me how I should go about doing this?

Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am looking to order some rings from Amazon preferably that would hang at an appropriate height from my pull-up bar. My bar hangs about 6.5 feet above the floor and I want rings that will allow me to do rows but the rings I’m seeing on Amazon at near 15 feet length which is far too much.  

I don’t have any other door frames that would allow me to hang the bar from a greater height, and I can’t drill or mess with any walls to install cables/rings which is why I would like to hang them from my bar.

Does anyone know of any rings I should purchase and what the ideal length of the straps would be? I’d also prefer to not spend more than 30ish dollars as I’m a beginner and I don’t think it’s worthwhile to be spending a fortune on any equipment at this stage. Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Yesterday morning was possibly the first time in my life I have ever worked out the muscles in my back. I either was deadlifting way too much weight (?) or my form was possibly bad or maybe this is normal for first time deadlift. Well basically I can barely bend over right now and everytime I go to put on my shoes I have to like Slav squat so my back doesn’t hurt. Is this just normal from muscle hypertrophy or whatever and I’m gonna be back stronger or did I do something wrong and injure myself? Because my arms kind of felt like this too when I did my first curls and bench press. (Clearly I am noob so please don’t make fun of me) 
If I’m doing something wrong then please instruct me or direct me to a video of proper deadlift form? Thanks guys

EDIT: someone in the comments suggested it might be something called DOMS. Which sounds accurate because Google says it feels the worst around 24-72 hours after the workout. Sounds exactly the same as what happened as it was my first time ever exercising those muscles or even deadlifting. Thanks for the advice guys. Hopefully with less weight next time and fewer lifts I’ll be able to strengthen my muscles to the point this doesn’t happen","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi,

Back pain expert Stuart McGill writes in one of his books that the clamshell excersise is an excersise to activate the gluteus medius and not a excersise to strengthen this muscle.

His words:

*The first stage involves isolating gluteus medius. Once again, the patient needs to feel the muscle and perceive its activation. The patient lies on her side, places her thumb on the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and reaches with the fingers posteriorly—the tips will be over the gluteus medius (a). With the hips and knees flexed, the patient spreads the knees apart like a clamshell, with the feet remaining together and acting as a hinge (b). The patient feels with the fingers the activation of gluteus medius.* ***This maneuver is to simply activate the gluteus medius and should not be considered a strengthening exercise***\*. There is no need to offer resistance at this stage (resistance is imposed later during strength training). True isolation of the gluteus medius is not possible; other muscles are active. In this posture, the external hip rotators are recruited. Recent work of Sidorkewicz, Cambridge, and McGill (2013) has shown that although muscles such as the tensor fascia latae are activated, the gluteus medius dominates this exercise, and the changing hip flexion does not substantially influence the relative activation of these two muscle groups.\*

Can the same be said about the glute bridge? I do the glute bridge a lot and I thought I strengthened the gluteus maximus with this. But I got confused when I read this.

"Hello :D

I train boxing around 3 days a week.

On top of that, 2-3 days a week I do additional strength training at home.

My body type currently is skinny fat.

&#x200B;

My goals are:

1. increase my overall strength, especially for boxing purposes
2. get a nice body

&#x200B;

My strength training routine is very simple:

1. Push-ups. I do push-ups progressions, once I hit 12 pushups in a single set, I increase the difficulty.

I do all my sets until the failure, and I do about 9-10 sets per training day. Not in a single training session, but just through the whole day.

2. jumping squats. Meaning that I squat down and then jump into the air. Once I build more core muscles, I want to add raising the legs upwards, close to the chest, while jumping.

Currently, I do about 40-60 of these in 3-4 sets.

3. four core exercises:

a) crunches

b) heel taps

c) while lying, horizontal scissors (with legs)

d) while lying, moving both of my legs up and down at the same time.

I do 2 sets, 35 reps of each exercise in a single set.

&#x200B;

About once a week I also do plank tap (2 sets of 10 reps)

When I'll lose some weight, I'm going to add pull-ups to my routine.

&#x200B;

So, how does this routine sound to you?

I don't really want to increase the time I spend on the strength training too much, however, I could add 1 or 2 more exercises if that would be significantly beneficial. I'm also not sure if my selection of core exercises is good, especially the c) and d).

Any suggestions?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Would drop sets work in calisthenics? I was thinking it would be useful to implement them to my program since it takes me 2hrs to finish it. It would be like this,

On horizontal pushing I do archers.
1st set is 6 reps of archers with the extended hand resting on a 1 foot high stool, then reduce the height to half a foot then on the floor then finish with side staggered PU. Would this replace a regular 4x7 of archers with 2 minutes rest?

I'd like to implement it on my other exercises (elevated pike PU, bodyweight rows, etc) except the pullup. Currently doing 4x5 + 10kg on that. 

Would this still work in terms of hypertrophy?

P.S. I'm doing full body 3x a week.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm honestly really impressed with how far calisthenics training has brought me.
I've mostly been doing the fundamentals to build muscle because I was scrawny and I'm now moderately bulky but not at the physique I originally intended to get to but my strength gains are amazing. 
I started training at the gym last August but had little to no success due to inconsistency. 
But around Feb I bought a pair of Rings and made my own Paralettes using PVC and grinded the ever living crap outta exercises and progressions to do pullups, Pseudo Planche pushups, Archer progressions, Pistol Squats, Handstands etc.
And now that I'm back at the gym again, my basic lifts(Bench Press & Deadlift) was amazing compare to the last time I was at the gym. Planning to start going on a cut to start doing the skills part although I was already doing quite a few tucked variations even though they're very small time periods.

Before Calisthenics journey, 
30kg Bench Press, no deadlift cuz I wasnt training that, 3 Reps Pullups, 6 Reps Dips. 

Current I'm at 70kg Bench Press, 115kg Deadlift, 10+ Reps Pullups, 15 Reps Dips, BW+15kg 6 Reps Dips, BW+15kgs 6 Reps of Pullups.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"The consensus on this sub-reddit is that dip belts are better than weight belts. I also agree that dip belts are superior but I don’t have the money for weights + I think the vest will be more useful for me based on my current situation and later down the line the combination with a dip belt would drastically help (when I reach those levels)

Also, I can increase intensity of workouts with an adjustable weighted vest by adding weight based on workout over time

My real question is, if I do invest in a vest, what’s the highest weight I should be looking for and why? I feel like 10lbs is too small but is 150 too overkill? I still intend on getting a dip belt as well

Sorry if this is a dumb question","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello fellow redditors,

Throughout my time here, I have seen many positive things in this subreddit such as people getting a hell lot of feedback.

I am in need of tips and exercises to improve/lower my center of gravity because, basically, I play football/soccer and I need a really good center of gravity for balance and speed. In layman's terms, I just need to increase my leg strength.

For those of you who don't know what I mean by improving it, I mean how can I lower it down to near my legs instead of the center of gravity being above my waist. So basically I am asking for good exercises to improve my leg strength. I may not be the best at explaining this, so I apologize.

Extra info: I am a 14M, weighs around 60kg probably and is around 170cm tall. I can do a decent amount of pistol squats, if I am warmed up.

So, my question is: What (lower body) exercises can I do to lower my center of gravity? Please provide some tips too!!

"I'm interested in increasing the amount of pull ups i can do in one set. Most of the time i have done typical full body workout three times a week and i have done pull ups in every training. In these trainings i have usually done 3 sets of pull ups and tried to make same amount of reps each set (so the last set is close to failure). 

I have heard that one good way to increase the reps (in any excersize?) is to do pull ups nearly every day (like 5 times a week). This way you should do few sets but in each set you should avoid failure and leave few reps in reserve (this way you dont burn out your muscles every time you train and you are ready to do the same training session next day, if necessary). 

Is this something to try out or is it completely bs?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So about a year ago I used to do bodyweight pretty frequently, and was in alright shape. Because of mental health and just everything that went on this year, I stopped doing exercise for a good amount of time and I've noticed it's effect (I'm up about 10-15 lbs, so not too much but I can see the difference in my body) and I can't say I have recovered 100% in mental health, so I started doing a program of doing a small amount of exercise throughout the day, but I'm not sure how great that would be.

\- 12 Push-ups  
\- 40-60 second planks  
\- 5-8 dips (my current limit)

"I started off my bodyweight journey on this subreddit, with the RR, but soon found that the RR, like a lot of gymnastics routines, is too mechanic/choppy for me. I really enjoy doing a flow of some kind (yoga, animal flow), as I find it connects all exercises, stretches, techniques together in a fun, dynamic way (which I also believe increases coordination).

I really enjoy a lot of yoga & animal flows, but find that a lot of the flows lack key techniques/exercises (such as planche, l-sit, handstands, splits, back bridges), which I have realized are the building blocks for a lot of my fitness goals - press to handstand, being at the top.

"I’ve checked with a physiotherapist and he gave me some stretching and instructions to heal the wrist.
I asked if I could still do some exercises, and yes I can as long as it doesn’t bend or put too much pressure on wrist.

Bear in mind I am already four weeks into no training, I feel like I’m losing all my hard work.

And so I went to train pull ups. Bad idea, the pain got acute and worse, most likely because my wrist was weak, and so I had to grip harder, which made things worse.

I’m wondering if there are any exercises even with weights that I can do whilst it heals.

Like for triceps, I do fist push ups. Idk if that’s also bad.

"I’m a 14 year old female, 165cm tall and I weigh around 60kg. I have never worked out my arms, even though I dabbled with cardio for a while and I felt motivated to start. I quickly realized that I can’t do one push-up, which wasn’t a big deal at first since this was expected. Though I can barley do one knee push-up either (which I had before), I’ve been working out with a focus on my arms for about two weeks now and I see no results. When I searched for advice, there were only answers from dudes, and they basically said to do just push-ups? 

My current workout is:
-5-10chair dips (though I experience quite a bit of pain in my shoulders)
-30sec to 1min hunters pose
-10 squats
-30 incline push-ups against a kitchen counter
-15-20 seconds push-up position
-5 half-push-ups
-10 half knee push-ups
-30 sec plank
-3 leg lifts
-10 sit-ups
And I repeat this most often twice, but sometimes three times. I work out every other day, sometimes two days in a row.
I finish it off with 15 minutes on a stationary bike, with the last 5 going all in.

"Hi everyone

I'm over a year following RR. My progress is very good. I'm reached, the point where I have to decide what to do next. I'm mostly  on advanced exercises and RR routine make me very tired. It was excellent until now. I do currently 15kg dips ,20 kg flat possition rows ,85 kg squat ( I can do more ,but don't wanna progress here at the moment) , normal pull-ups ( straggling here to get more volume),65 kg Romanian deadlift ,85 kg deadlift, nearly full pseudoplanche pushups.  I do either find new program or do some adjustments to RR routine. I have been searching for programs. The most I like is Fitnessfaq ,but then I found information about gymnastics method from Adam Godrosi. I would like ask if someone doing this program or have done in past. I will appreciate any advice how to adjust RR to make further progress and not dying after workout. Maybe longer brakes between sets? I don't know. Of course I will appreciate advice on any other good program there with good references. My main goal is have very strong core to avoid back pain which I didn't have since starting RR. It's excellent program I would like to continue ,but I'm without power on last exercises.(weighted rows , following by pseudoplanche pushups are proper killers). I do own the OG2 book as well ,but I have absolutely no time to reading it properly and study. I do work 80 hours a week and I just wanna follow some programs three times a week max 1:30 min. I don't have more time.

"Hi Everyone,

Firstly thanks for taking the time to look at this post. Just after some guidance on if the below appears viable in incorporating weight, calisthenics and strength-based skills or if there's anything you'd change.

I have a home gym with squat rack, barbell, dumbbells so I want to make the most out of those too.

&#x200B;

Questions I have would be is the below viable? And is doing once-a-week strength-based skill patterns enough for feasible progression? (Albeit slow)

Is there anything I could be getting free? Thinking I could probably get away with not doing the upper isolation exercises, but then again for how long they actually take to complete it might be worth just doing them.  


The aim is to get the ""most bang for the buck"", in addition to the below I'd be doing a short L-Sit and handstand practice most days prior.

Worth noting that hypertrophy would be the priority, but don't want to completely neglect skill variants.

"First of all, I hope this is the right place for this post. If not, please call me out, and I'll repost elsewhere. 

One of my current goals I'm working towards is to increase my weighted pullup. I had been previously using an iron gym (over the door pull-up bar), and it worked fine up until 36kg, at which point the frame broke because I wasn't thinking ahead :) (did manage to fix the frame though!)

I suffered from a really bad herniated disc in my neck last year and had to reset everything, and I'm now back up to around 26kg and wanted to get a more long term solution to this problem before I get too strong for my door again.

"Hello everyone! I'm a 14 year old boy and have gotten into working out (mix of calisthenics and weights). I've just started wanting to have a healthy diet and track how many calories I'm consuming, however, I don't know how many calories I **SHOULD** be consuming. I go to my local gym 2-3 times a week and each session is anywhere from 1hr 15min to 1hr 45min (depending on when my parents can pick me up).

So, with this information, how many calories should I be consuming?

Note: It's the off-season for club rugby league so I won't be starting again for another 6 months.

Quick question: Because MyFitnessPal (calorie tracking app) won't work accurately due to my age and it not being designed for kids my age, is there any other apps similar to MyFitnessPal that provide the both a tracker and accurate calorie intake of my age?

"Reposting as a thread as I think the daily questions thread is just about dead - damn timezones.

I've been struggling with a weird slump in my workouts lately and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice.

In the last couple of weeks my routine's become much harder. I'm struggling to perform 3 sets of exercises I'm used to being able to do 4-5 sets of fairly easily (I dropped back from harder exercises because I suddenly found them borderline impossible). 

For reference, I typically do an Upper/Lower&amp;Core split 5-6 days a week. I'm 28, recently put on a bit of weight (80kg, up from 70kg last summer) but I think it's mostly muscle as I'm still pretty lean overall. I run a couple of times a week - same distance each time (10km), but that's been getting harder too and I've found myself walking the last few km's the last week or so.

This is my typical routine:

Day 1

Wide Grip L-sit Pullups 4-5 sets 10 reps

HeSPU (wall-assisted) 4-5x8

Wide Ring Rows 4-5x15

Pseudo Planche Pushups 4-5x12

Ring Dips 4-5x12

Pelican Curls on rings 4-5x12

Day 2

Pistol Squats 4x10

Hanging Straight Leg Raises 4x15

Shrimp Squats 4x10

Hamstring Curls on rings 4x12

The Core Triplet from the RR to finish off (I mix this up more)

Nothing else has really changed in my day to day routine - I'm sleeping about the same amount, if not more to try to account for feeling terrible when I work out. My diet's been steady and work's been consistent for the last year so no obvious stressors. I don't know what's causing this slump but I can barely get through a pared-down workout at the moment and I'm getting pretty frustrated.

Any ideas?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Am I doing too much volume? Is it possible to make this routine faster?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"The reason I'm asking this question is because the author of the book 'Convict Conditioning' recommends keeping elbows slightly bent (instead fully straight) in the bottom position to take stress off the arm joints, both for standard pull-ups and (especially) for one arm pull-ups, as you can see here:

\- [Figure 49 (pull-ups step 5, initial position)](https://masfuertequeelhierro.com/blog/calistenicos/pullups/step5.jpg): *""Retain a very slight (almost unnoticeable) bend in the elbow to take the stress off the elbow joints)""*

\- [Picture 59 (pull-ups step 10, initial position):](https://masfuertequeelhierro.com/blog/calistenicos/pullups/step10.jpg) *""Your working arm should be virtually straight, with just a little kink in it to take the stress off the arm joints""*

However, I've not read this kind of technique advice anywhere outside of Convict Conditioning (it seems like an unique tip from that book). In my case, **I always keep my elbows fully straight in the initial deadhang position, and I'm not sure if doing that** (in addition to excessive volume) **might have been a contributing factor to my previous golfer's elbow injuries.**

What do you think? Is keeping elbows slightly bent in the bottom position helpful to save the joints and prevent injuries? Or is it actually not helpful at all for that purpose and thus completely unnecessary?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi all, I recently started training for the Back Lever, and as it is a pretty taxing exercise on the biceps and elbow joint, I wanted to add a biceps isolation exercise at the end of my upper body workouts. The goal is mainly to strengthen and condition the tendons to prevent a tendinopathy from emerging (I also have the OAC as a long-term goal, so I want to start prehabbing for that as well), but obviously some hypertrophy/strength gains are also desirable.

I recently experimented with pelican curl eccentrics (for which I posted a form check post a few days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/qousxn/pelican_curl_eccentrics_form_check_and_advice/)), and although I'm now more confident with my execution and definitely feel those in the biceps, I'm wondering if they are not actually **aggravating the risk of injury** : they are very taxing and are a high intensity exercise, and put the shoulder and elbow joint in a disadvantageous and unusual position. I am starting to feel some discomfort in my elbows after a few sessions already, so I'm not sure they're appropriate for the situation. I've read in some places that eccentrics are good for tendon conditioning, and in some other places that they are a factor of tendinopathy (as they put even more load on the joint than the muscle can ""normally"" withstand in a concentric exercise) : does someone have good-quality information on that subject ?

I have access to dumbbells, so I was thinking a mix of biceps/hammer curls with a high rep/low intensity scheme at the end of my workouts would maybe be a more clever choice, what is your advice ? Bicep curls do not resemble the back lever posture and movement at all though, so I guess transferrable strength gains are not to be expected here...","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm 26, 6'0 and 160lbs average (I say average cause my weight varies a lot) but used to be in the 152lbs range before I started working out consistently 2 months ago. When I started I could barely do 3 bicep curl sets with the 20lbs dumbbells and now I can do 30lbs without feeling like I'm dying. I go to the gym 3 times a week and focus on my arms (I have breadstick arms). So after 2 months I do feel stronger but visibly I don't notice any gains, obviously I look swole after working out but after the months 2 my arms look pretty much thr same. I eat enough protein every day plus a whey protein shake and a generous amount of carbs. Any tips to start seeing muscle? Is 2 months enough to start seeing results? What am I missing? When I went to the nutritionist she said my metabolism is quite fast, I'm in my late 20s and it hasn't slowed down lol.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hopefully you intelligent people can help me. 

I'm a 26yo male, 5'11"", 170Lbs (76kg). I've been doing bodyweight exercises for a while, mostly sticking with pullups, pushups, rows, and wall HSPU, with some simple Core and occasional lower body exercises. I went to the gym today for the first time in about 2 years, and just hit every muscle group, just to get a benchmark. 

Well, I notice that my mind-muscle connection is much better in the gym. I've had pretty poor lat activation on my left side, to the point where i've got some obvious muscular imbalance going on back there. Today, I was getting solid contraction in muscles I typically don't feel much while doing bodyweight exercises. My chest pump during Bench Press was great, and my Lats were on fire, but my total volume wasn't really any different than during a bodyweight workout. 

I don't do single joint movements, only compounds. Any idea why this is happening?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Currently I'm working out 4/5 days a week. I'm lifting weights for about 70-90 minutes, after that I ride my bike (hometrainer) for an hour every time. I've been doing this for a year and a half, but I don't think I can do it anymore this way. On a lot of days I'm eating dinner at 9.00 or 10.00 in the evening, because that's when I'm done with my workout. (It's almost a 3 hour workout in total)

When I started years ago I did zero cardio. That was fine, but at some point I started to look like a powerlifter, wasn't really what I was going for... so I started doing all that cardio. 

I'm now taking a week off, because I think I'm overtrained. When I'm starting again, should I just do the cardio on my rest days? Or maybe in the morning?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi :)

I am a 27 years old women with a body fat percentage of 23 according to the tape test. My BMI is 20 but I have a small frame so, I don't look that thin

I have some fat on my lower belly and my love handles. It's not completely ""flat"" and I would like to achieve a leaner look.

When I am wearing a tight panty for instance, I do have a muffin top :(

How exactly am I supposed to do this ?

Is eating at a calorie deficit and doing some cardio enough ?

Or should I gain some muscle ?

Plus I feel like my body is kind of stubborn with his fat storage, so is losing my love handles and a bit of belly realistic ?

I am kind of lost

Thank you !","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Another year is about to end. This year has been equally chaotic for most. Some people managed to get out of the slump by working out, some totally changed their habits by working out for the first time. This sub brought out a new routine for beginners the BWF Primer. Some people couldn't get into regular workouts due to constrained space, time or health limitations as our workplace and ways of living changed drastically. 

This is an appreciation post for both types. You all are wonderful. Now it is time to share your experiences of working out with mainly bodyweight workouts from either your home or a nearby park or whatever you could lay your hands on. You share your journey so that people of the future can learn from your little beautiful unique stories. 

Kindly mention your age and fitness level before this year. What kind of workouts were you doing? What changes did you observe? Not only physical, any change that you can attribute to the habit of working out consistently. If it was a new habit for you how did you get into it? How have your lifestyle and daily events changed due to building strength and muscle? If I am missing out any aspect, add that too.   


Let this thread turn into a yearbook of sorts but for BWF stories which are all unique in their own right.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been doing pull ups for half a year, Initially I could do 5, the amount of reps rapidly increased in the first few months, but I've been stuck at 15 pull ups for 3 months now. Last two weeks I've been actively trying to break through it by doing pull ups everyday, trying to get to 10x5 pull ups with 3 minutes rest in between, but with zero improvement. Every session goes almost exactly like this:
3 sets of 10 pullups
1 set of 9 pullups (failure)
1 set of 8 pullups (failure
1 final set to failure (more sets if I fail to reach 50 total pull ups).

I have no clue what's going on. I'm making no progress and even though I'm going to failure everyday I have practically no soreness, which might imply that I'm not training my body, even though I'm really trying to push my limits.

What do I do?

TLDR:
Plateau'ed at pull ups, currently doing 5 sets a day (some sets to failure) but not improving.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I have been fascinated by muscle ups for a couple of years now. For alot of time i struggled with the technique and transition which was very frustrating. The gamechanger for me was the grip. By switching to a false grip on the bar and by swinging corrently around the bar and not directly up like with a pull up like i did before i was finally able to do one! its crazy how much is actually just technique.   When I started to used to the pull i managed to do 4 in a row with very little kipping

If you want to learn the muscle up and can do several pull ups with good form look i garantee you can do it with proper technique!

"I’ve got a newborn. He’s great, but has an irregular sleep schedule, therefore so do I. I know that one of the first pieces of advice given to people getting fit is to get a solid eight hours every night. Normally I do that, but it’s just not in the cards for the next six months. So what changes, if any, should I make to my workout?

For reference, I’m 37M, 178cm, 70kg. I did the recommended routine for a few years and about 9 months ago switched to KBroges’s daily PPL routine, and really like it. He recommends switching between high and low intensity, and since the baby was born, what I can reach with high intensity has definitely decreased. For example, I used to max out at 3 sets of 11 pull-ups with good form. Today I tried that and could only hit 9,9,7. 

So I’m wondering if I should adjust my goals for “high” intensity to be more achievable until I have more energy? Or should I keep pushing for what I was able to do in the past? Or just stick to low intensity for the foreseeable future? Any tips?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello everybody,

when i look at the RR i see three pairs and one triplet. Is there any insight in how it affects the body if you do single sets, pairs, triplets, quadruplets?

For myself im doing quadruplets out of push, pull and squat variations with a rest time at ca. 30sec - 1min.

Rep range is from 5-10 with 5 sets in total (main goal: strength with a little bit of muscle growth). The quadruple gives me enough rest to do e.g. 5x10 body rows in sum, which wouldnt be possible for me to optain if i would do exercises in pairs.

I adjust the rest time when im out of breath.

I searched the FAQ but only found a recommendation against circles (no rest in between sets) but no clear advice for/against the building of pairs, triplets, quadruples.

(Exercises are Pullups, rows, ab-wheel, archer pushups, ring dips, overhead press, barbell squats, pistol squats, barbell skater squats)

I would love to hear your opinions!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hi guys!

I'd really appreciate it if you'd rate my routine. I'm 182cm (5'11) , 81kg. My goal is strength and to keep getting stronger and keep gaining muscle. I'm doing alpinism and want to get more into freeclimbing.

I am currently doing **531 + modified RR** and it takes me around 2+ hours. I do enjoy it and still feel the progress but those 2 hours are getting quite a bit out of time from my day and I would like to optimize it .

My routine:

* **531 Routine** (my max values below)
* Bench 80kg / Press 50kg
* Squat 90kg / Deadlift 110kg
* 11 rounds of above exercises that I combine (Monday - Bench/Squat, Wednesday - Press/Deadlift, Friday Squat/Bench)
* The intensity varies depending on the day/week schedule according to my 531 template.
* I rest around 2 minutes between sets.

&#x200B;

After I'm done with 531, i start with **RR Bodyweight** complementary exercises.

* Pull ups / Dips - 3x8
* Planche pushups / Horizontal rows - 3x8
* Leg raises / Arch raises - 3x12
* I rest around 1.5 minutes between exercises

Once done I do a bit of stretching and that's it. I'm done.

&#x200B;

Please reflect on it, tell me what i'm doing good and what i can do better. Feedback is most welcome.

sorry for spelling, not my native language.

You can also rate it 1-10 :)

Kind regards,

"I'm curious if anyone has tried a greasing the groove style approach but for the whole body rather than just one exercise? 

Eg something like Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, Dips. Depending on how it goes maybe add Kettlebell Swings in the future. 

I work from home, have all the equipment I need and have plenty of time on my hands. So I could easily do each exercise one per hour. I could even separate out the 2 upper and lower body exercises eg: Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, (wait 30 mins), Dips, Kettlebell Swings, (wait 30 mins), repeat.  

I’d also do some light cardio after work just once a day, taking rest days from this as needed. I'd say I'm currently at an intermediate level.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello there, 

I'm looking for a new bar/station that allows me to do mainly pull ups and if possible dips or other upper body exercises. I need something that doesn't need to drill in the wall or attaching to the door frames.

For the moment I had a look on the BaseBlocks equipment like THE BIG BAR and also the B BARS, looking on the website and YouTube I see that this kind of equipment allow me to do a lot of exercises,  maybe the B BARS more than the BIG BAR.

Do you have any suggestion on this kind of equipment, available for shipping in EU?

In the past I had a pull up bar for door frames, sometimes used with rings, but never used a pull up bar that wouldn't allow me to stand with my legs dangling. I tried to do some pullups using my half squat rack and the barbbell as bar but I wasn't feeling stable enough, despite I would also enjoy to start working on my core muscles.

"Hello,

Recently I have decided to try and get back into a routine of body weight exercises. I have been doing 15 push ups, 15 crunches, 15 push ups, 15 crunches and then a 60/70 second plank x3 and then another 15 of each followed by a final plank of 60 secs. (105 of each in total).

This makes me sweat a fair amount and makes my body ache a good amount the next day but I’m definitely missing out on some important exercises I could be doing too.

What do you recommend I could add to my routine? I flirted with squats in the past but haven’t started them again since I restarted.

"Hi guys, 

Longtime lurker here looking for some advice. 

I created this workout in May this year and I have been using it 3 times a week, occasionally missing the odd day. I feel that I’m now not progressing as much as I would like so I would love some information on how to switch things up and get more gains. 

Here is the workout- 

Workout 1
10x ring push-ups 
10x ring chest flys 
10x pull ups
10x pull up rows 
10x squats
20x calf lifts 
45 second plank 

Workout 2 
10x (wide/narrow) incline push-ups  
10x (ring)dips
20 second ring holds
10x chin ups/narrow grip
10x underhand rows
10x tricep dips 
45 second hip hinge 
12 x hanging leg raises

Back to day 1…

I do these workouts Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So I would alternate the workouts every other day. 

I have thought about making some of the moves harder such as archer push-ups, pistol squats etc. 

Any input on how to improve my gains would be a great help, many thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello r/bodyweightfitness. I've been doing a routine that is a variation on CC for about four months. I'm focussed on light bodyweight and high volume to condition myself for heavier efforts in the future. Results have been good. I've gained strength and muscle and lost some fat. 

I get *really bad DOMS the day after legs*, but mainly ***in my left adductor***. The workout consists if close to 100 bodyweight full squats over 4-5 sets. I assume this means I'm tighter on my left side. What can I do to alleviate the excruciating DOMS, which last week lasted 3-4 days, in my left adductor?

"Male, 42, 188cm, 72kg. Pretty much always been this weight. About 15 years ago, I started doing regular chinups to try and look a bit more buff for the ladies. I remember being able to do 7 when I started. Over the years, I've gone through brief periods of doing training, followed by long periods of doing nothing (never been able to maintain the habit). At my peak I was able to do about 20 good form pullups, but that was years ago.

It's about 2 years since I last did any training. Yesterday I tried to see how many pullups I could do, and managed 12. I was surprised - having not done any working out for 2 years, I could do 50% more pullups than I could 15 years ago.

So does the body really maintain strength for THAT long?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am looking to start incorporating bodyweight fitness into my yoga/fitness routine, to help me advance my yoga practice (yoga is my main focus as part of my mental and physical self care).

I walk my dog for 1-2hrs a day, and tend to do my yoga practice after that. Normally a 15min+ full body stretch most days, and then I either do a targeted stretch (mostly hips and hamstrings, as they're 'problem areas' for me) or some 'muscle focus' e.g. a few minutes of plank with various leg movements. I then might spend 5 minutes practicing certain yoga poses to prepare for more advanced yoga moves.

I guess that's the gist of my 'fitness' routine. What I want to know is how often I should be doing a 'muscle focus' for it to be actually beneficial? e.g. if after each yoga stretch, one day I did a short upper body workout, another day lower body, and another day abs, perhaps each up to twice a week (if my body allows - yoga has taught me when to push and when to back off) and following any of them would be a few minutes of headstand practice, or backbend practice, etc.

Sorry if this is a bit of a messy read! I just want to make sure what I am doing will help me achieve the goals I have set.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi all,

I’ve done BWF in the past, specifically this sub’s RR. I’m a pretty avid cyclist and reasonably healthy but I recently went rock climbing and I was pretty embarrassed at how t-rexed I’ve gotten. 

I move a lot and I’ve always had trouble finding/making a good set of dip and pull up bars. I also find exercises on the floor kind of… gross. Enter: rings. 

I recently got some rings that I’m pretty excited about. I hooked them up to my hammock eye bolts and tried some angled rowing sort of exercises on them, and it felt really good. It really seems like I can do every exercise I need to with these things.

I know rings are generally considered harder than bars since they’re less constrained, but if I start off with angled exercises and supports, could I use my rings from the beginning? 

I kinda want to use them even for planks and push-ups and other ground exercises. Never liked the way the flat angle of ground push-ups puts pressure on my wrist. The ring grip seems much more natural (maybe it reminds me of a handlebar?). Again, if I started with angled ring push-ups or even knee push-ups, does anyone see any problem with this plan?

Essentially, my question is: if I swap in ring exercises everywhere I can in the RR and I like and can perform the workout I come up with, will I miss out on anything or potentially hurt myself?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Crossposted to r/Fitness

Hello everyone. I've been doing bodyweight workout for about 4 months now, specifically the [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/), and developed a good baseline level of strength. Thing is, I'll be joining a gym in a few days. Read Steven Low's [article](https://stevenlow.org/integrating-bodyweight-and-barbell-training/) and a bunch of Reddit threads and decided it would be better if I switch out every exercise in the RR for it's weighted equivalent, except the pull-up. So it would look like this:

First pair:

\- Scapular Pulls (Pull-up progression) 3x5-8

\- Barbell Squat / Deadlift (alternate) 3x5-8 / Deadlift 1x5

Second pair:

\- OHP 3x5-8

\- Hamstring Curls 3x5-8

Third Pair:

\- Barbell Rows 3x5-8

\- Bench Press 3x5-8

For core, I'll do 3 sets of Ab Wheel Rollouts. Also gonna do some sets of farmer walks and facepulls as accessory work in the end. And gonna do this program 3x/week.

I'd like to follow this program because I'm really familiar with the RR but I don't know if I should, considering it was originally made for purely bodyweight stuff. Also, is this over-training? I'm not a beginner to working out and I've been to the gym a year ago so I'm familiar with all these lifts.

Thanks for your help!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
" I've (5'7, 160lbs) been trying to practicing push up for ROTC exam in six month for a while now which requires 22 pushups in 2 minute to pass. I'm planning on losing weight as well so hopefully it should be easier down the line. I'm not a physically fit person and rarely works out so my muscle tone is not that much. 

As of right now, I'm most worried about pushups the most. I can do a couple of bench push ups (below waist) but I prioritize quantity so my current routine is doing 3 sets of 50 reps of wall push ups as recommended by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Yd2YpIDkI)

I've been struggling to do the wall push up consecutively and always paused at around the 25th push. Thing is, it's been like this for over a week now and I've seen no improvement on my ability at all, nor does my pecs, biceps, and triceps feel any more firm or stronger. 

Is push ups alone enough for me to be able to perform even more pushups?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So my wife and i had our first child last June. Before then, we have always been avid fitness people, working out 4-5/week. When Covid hit, we moved to BWF and followed the RR. We saw some amazing results from it and i fell in love with this style of working out. 

A year and a half later since starting the RR, our baby finally came and I thought it would be an awesome time for a break. The plan was to take a month off and then get back at it. Well, as the old saying goes, ""the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray"". The first month came and went, then 2, then 4, then now finally 6. 

Before the baby, I honestly can't remember the last time i went even a week without working out in some way and I definitely feel it. But trying to manage the balance of a kid and working out is.... challenging. Aside from the fact i feel demotivated because i feel I lost alot of progress in that time.

Anyway, i'm thinking about starting a split routine for easing back in and time constraints. Probably the OG split routine (upper and lower).

I guess i'm looking for encouragement, motivation, and advice on how best to get back to doing something that i love.

"Hi all, happy new year!

I have been going over this question in my mind for a while now and I cannot seem to figure it out completely.

I’m 26 y/o (m), about 83kg, 185cm tall, and started training with weights back in November. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time and have friends who have much knowledge on fitness, so I have been able to learn a bit on the subject.

I work out (right now with dumbbells due to restrictions) about 3-6 times a week, on average more like 4-5 times.
It’s not a bodyweight routine, sorry about that, but I am not sure where else to post this - I’ve seen people getting great advice on here so I figured it’s worth a shot.

I am currently on an about 1800-2000 kcal/day diet, with a ‘zigzag’ moment in the weekends (where I eat a bit more in ‘cheat days’: around 2500 kcal on 2 days). On average, that means I have a calorie intake of about 15000 kcal a week, so 2150/day. I take 2 scoops of Whey and try to prioritise proteines in my meals (chicken & egg or sandwiches, chicken thigh for dinner, etc.); overall about 130 grams of proteine a day. I also started eating more healthily regarding my carbs (whole wheat pasta and whatnot).

I made some good progress in the meantime, but I am not sure if what I am doing is the best way to go for me right now. My friend told me my calorie intake is too low and will cause me to lose weight too quickly. 

I am not sure what to do now. I enjoy the progress I made already (as well as the speed), but I also want to do it all as healthily as I can. 

What do you guys advise me to do? Am I in the way of my own progress? Should I increase calorie intake, or keep the status quo? 

Thanks in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi!

I’m quite the rookie at calistenics as I’ve only been working for about 6 months. I would still consider myself close to average since I can manage 10+ pullups and 15+ dips(not trying to brag just so you know my approx. current strength).

So my question is regarding exercises that target the lower back. In the program I’m following there are Skin The Cat exercises. I can’t really do them without bending my arms, but other than that I had no problem with them. But a month or so into doing them I started to get severe back pain. Taking deep breaths would physically hurt for example. So I simply stopped doing them altogether.

I’m not sure if this is because the exercise is really difficult and shouldnt be done until proper strength has been achieved. Or perhaps im doing it wrong? 

So I’m just looking for some advice as to how to move forward. Are there any other good exercises for the lower back that I could swap it out for? 

Thanks in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I'm kind of a noob to muscle building and I actually plan to mostly use weights with some bodyweight stuff in between, but I thought I would ask here since you guys seem way nicer and more accepting of newbies than *other* subs on here.

So to my main question. I have lost a lot of weight before and while doing that, I did mostly cardio stuff so I understand how calories and nutrition work already but I have very limited knowledge and experience with muscle building. I have been searching for a good program to start with but there are just so many out there that each have their own ""thing"" to them that supposedly makes that one routine the ""best"". 

I have absolutely no way of knowing which routine is actually the best as there are so many terms and definitions thrown around and so many people saying that only their way works and all that stuff just confuses and overwhelms me because I have no idea what it all means. The only things I have seen that almost everyone agrees on is that nutrition, rest and progressive overload is important to building muscle. So is the type of routine I choose really that important if I am applying those 3 things?

I also read that beginners can usually build muscle much easier, but once I stop being a beginner, what kind of routine am I supposed to do then?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Where do I even start lol. I’m 16 years old, male, and weigh 150lbs. I’m have a “Skinny-Fat” physique. So I’ve been trying to get back into fitness recently, and I’ve decided that starting on the 1st I will start working out every day and try to reach my “dream physique” by the end of May. I have a lot of resolutions I plan to keep throughout the new year, and so I’m really trying to keep my motivation up and make it to may with that goal in mind. My dream physique is an overall more defined and built muscles all around, as well as a six pack( if that’s possible lol). I got skinny forearms and calves that I’m really self conscious about, so I really want to bulk those up too. Last year I was really skinny, I weighed 80lbs and was a twig. I dirty bulked up to 150, and I worked out up until school started, which I then stopped and my physique that I gained was gone, as well as the ability to do normal workouts like push ups and pull ups. Now that I’m planning on starting to workout again, I need help finding a workout program that’ll get me to my goal by the end of may. I have 10,15,20,&25 lbs weights, a pull-up bar, a strong resistance and that I can use, along with multiple grip strengtheners. I know the first thing in getting fit is diet, so eating healthy and tracking my calories is something I already hav planned out, but I still need a workout plan. Rn I’m thinking of trying out Igor voitenkos plans, but I really need something that’ll help me reach my goals by the end of may. I like planning things out and knowing what workouts I’m gonna do in advance, bc it is overall easier for me to stick to something if I already have a plan. So if there are any apps or workout programs that you recommend pls lmk, as I’m trying to get into the best shape of my life this year.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"The exercise in question is easiest to describe by picturing Jesus Christ in his last moments. Just the the look of it, not the feeling for obvious reasons. 


So I was standing in the gym stretched between two cable machines facing each other (cross over pulls set-up) with my arms locked straight. It felt like dead hang with arms pulled to the side. I was able to do both passive (dead) stretch and active stretch as well as very limited range scapular pulls. I experimented for a while with amount of loaded weight to the point I had trouble getting hold of both cables because you need to grab one cable, then walk over to grab the other. That limited my maximum loading so I gave up. 


This morning at home I did a unilateral version on rings. So I laid on the floor on my side and grabbed a ring above, and just hang on it doing sort of a ""'hanging' side-plank"". Now this was very different and much higher load than in the gym. 


I could do both passive hang and active hang and a little scapular motion as well, and then I stopped abruptly in fear that this could be one of those moments of stupidity when one get injured and ends up with a dislocated shoulder. 


So I wanted to see if any of you have experience with this ""stretch"" and if it's any different than a dead hang or if it overlaps too much or not safe enough to be worth considering.

"Hi everyone,

I am hoping to add in some regular (3-4 days), brief (10-15 mins), potentially core-focused calisthenics into my workout routine. I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations on a good routine that fits the above criteria. Any general recommendations are welcome, too. 

Context: I’ve been back into working out since May 2021, and I’ve been fairly consistent but am getting burnt out from the sprints I’ve been doing during lunch time. I’m finding my joints are getting too sore and I dread going at that time. I’m hoping to find a speedy and high intensity calisthenics routine to fit in instead.

My current workout looks like this: 
Running/sprints 10 mins 4x weekly (8mph to 8.5 9 9.5) 
Boxing 1x weekly (50 mins)
Hot yoga 1x weekly (50 mins)
This weight training routine (split into 5 days instead of 4 due to leg day being a bit too heavy) https://www.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/4daypower_0.pdf
Swimming lessons 2x weekly 

One concern I had with my current routine is that I don’t implement any core work, so I was thinking calisthenics would be a good way to fill that gap. That being said, I think boxing and swimming might also be helpful for that purpose. 

If demographic info and fitness level is helpful, I’m a 30 year old male who is a fitness novice and I am about 6’, 175 lbs, I have a bit of muscle definition in my back, traps, chest, and my body fat is most noticeable around my core. 

Any comments, questions, recommendations are very helpful.

Thank you. 😊","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

GTG is supposedly a neutral adaptation, so if I stopped GTG would I lose all the strength i've gained, or would I maintain because I added weight. I really wanna increase the strength in these exercises and this method is working well, but if it's only temporary it might be a waste of time.

"Im 16, 6'2 and 205.

I currently do home workouts with some equipment, mostly weights for squats and the like. I have been doing a full body workout every night for about 30-45 mins for over a year, and I have achieved aesthetic and rep goals, and am plateauing, but that's why I have added weights.

My newer goal is to lower my body fat percentage. I guess it is around 25 percent, and that it is mostly controlled by diet though, so give me some foods to avoid.

So I do a full body split 7 times a week, and don't feel tired or like I need to recover. So I am considering doing a push-pull-legs-push-pull-legs-rest-repeat split.

"In brief: stopped taking creatine after almost 2 years, mostly out of curiosity (wanted to see what the effects might be). Within a week lost 1.5kg (expected, mostly water), but I'm not sure I've noticed any perceptible difference in my power output.

"Hi, I've been working out my whole life, and am in decent shape, but I never took upper body as seriously as I could be. I can do many sets of 15 pullups but I don't know if my methods are the most effective. I've read the FAQ is my routine good section I would like more help if thats alright.

My training is upper body only since I have legs covered. I do circuits that look like this:
Exercise 1(dips)
Abs/Core(situps, ab roller, leg lifts from bar, plank, etc..)
Exercise 2(arms-tucked-to-side pushups)
Abs/Core
Rest~4.5mins
3 Sets of this usually

No rest otherwise, last set try to max.

My common exercise pairs are:
Pullups/normal pushups
Chinups/ diamond pushups
Muscle ups/ Front dips
and some other ones I make up on the spot haha

This has gained me muscle in the past, and I like it because I can be done in less than thirty minutes. I try to do it 3-4 times a week.

My main question is this: How can I make it better? Either with better exercise pairs (I know about the whole push/pull day thing but dont get it), or better rest/ circuit methods with proven ways to make it better. Should I incorporate high protein foods after? I used to when I was younger but now I just eat some peanut butter.

My only limitation is to not make the routine long, the only reason I do this is because I don't have to do it for 3 hours a day, thats for running :)

I would honestly say diet was more important than specific exercises but I want to show what can be achieved without weights .

 My  routine consisted of  variations  of pushups  , pullups , bodyweight squats , dips, , leg raises and athleanx , ab exercises , box jumps  and skipping  

Every morning after I wake up and every night before I sleep I do a 2min plank , 25 pushups and 25 squats . 

I am addicted to the results . I feel great and I plan to start using dumbells for isolation exercises soon as I am finding my biceps and shoulders lacking immensely .

"Hi All.  I've seen this question come up dozens of times on this sub about the carryover from HSPU to overhead press and I wanted to give my results on my 2 year journey into high rep HSPU and carryover once I got back into the gym.   When I say HSPU I mean full ROM HSPU on high parallettes.  Hands going down to shoulders, head not touching the ground at all. 

My stats: 5'7"" 175. 


My general shoulder workout for the past 2 years has been the following for 3x a week:  

10x10 HSPU  

3 x 12 Side laterals (DB)

3 x 12 Rear Delts (DB)


When I finally got back into the gym a week ago I was able to strict overhead press 185 for 3 reps, and 135 for 10.   I imagine after a few weeks back with a barbell those numbers should go up significantly.    I'm curious if anybody else has seen similar results, but mainly wanted to show that yes HSPU do carry over to OHP.  1 rep at 175 is a lot harder than 1 HSPU despite my weight.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I'm 14 and for the past 3 months I've been working out at my local gym. My workout routine consists of both bodyweight exercises and lifting weights.

Only issue is, I don't feel like I'm progressing. I've been struggling to get to 4 strict form pullups (chest to bar). I want to develop enough strength so I can learn cool tricks such as the front lever and so on but if I'm not making any progressions - it'll be impossible.

I've always been a cold shower in the afternoon and hot shower at night guy. Cold shower for muscle recovery and shit (mainly to wake me up after nap) and hot shower to help me sleep better. But recently i found that most athletes cold shower after their workouts so i was wondering whether should i cold shower or hot shower after workout (forgot to mention my workout finish 3hrs before bed and after 1hr i do hot shower).

So here are the main benefits of both, for cold: muscle recovery, sigma male shit, for hot: relax muscle to sleep better, beta simp dickhead shit. Does better sleep(hot) > better muscle recovery(cold) or vice versa, or is there other factors to consider

Btw why does cold shower in the morning even help recovery, i mean you are starting the day to work, do you recover as you work??

Btw asking this cuz nobody seem to analyze the pros and cons or provide good science, only personal annecdotes. Also personally i sleep better with hot, be more awake, but perhaps performance in the gym would suck more than cold??","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Hey guys.

I'm 6'5 and weight 150 pounds.... this is me: [https://imgur.com/a/hsfYYOm](https://imgur.com/a/hsfYYOm)

Will i benefit from bodyweight exercises or should I join a gym? I feel like my proportions will make it harder for me to gain mass with bodyweight exercises. A lot of my tall friends are very dogmatic in that gym is the only way to gain respectable muscle for a tall guy. I'm not sure if I can believe them.

Of course, you can build mass as a rookie from practically any exercise but I want to invest in boydweight equipment and be sure it will pay off in the long run. Long limbs and gymnastic rings sound like a terrible combo to me - hopefully it is my rookie instinct messing with me. Also, the idea of pistol squats sounds absolutely insane to me since my legs are build for hunting frogs in a swamp and I can't fandom how such a long range of motion with such a low weight will make them grow past the initial noob gains.

Also, is it even worth filling out my frame? I feel like I don't have the base to look good even with normal BMI. I've seen skinny guys with bad frames gaining respectable amount of muscle but their proportions were so off that they looked far better before.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

A while ago, I came up with the idea for an app that would generate a random workout based on a series of parameters (equipment owned, ability level, duration of workout etc).This was when I was between programs but still wanted to work out, but wasn't sure what to do for the workouts.

The way I'd see it is like this

1. Enter the parameters needed (equipment, ability, muscles to work etc)
2. Press a button
3. Have a workout ready to do that is tailored to your requirements

Simple as that. Now obviously this isn't designed to replace a dedicated workout program, but is rather for the times when you want to workout but don't know what to do. Eg, in between programs

This is my first post here and I (14M) would like some advice related to increasing vertical jump without weights (I have a resistance band and my own bodyweight only :( ).

So, here is my current routine for increasing the strength in my lower body and I would like to receive any suggestions or advice you may have!:

3 sets x 5 reps: Single-legged resistance band deadlifts, supersetted with explosive alternating lunges; 5 reps on each leg. 1m 30s rest in between.

3 sets x 6 reps: Pistol Squats, supersetted with Depth jumps; 4 reps.

3 sets x 5 reps: Bulgarian Split Squats supersetted with Kneeling squat jumps for 4 reps; first one, jump up high; second one jump forward, third one jump left, fourth jump right. [Similar to th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRN1Yzo0hjU&t=100s&ab_channel=TheLostBreed)ese variations.

3 sets x 8 reps: Calf raises supersetted with seated jumps for 4 reps.

Rest time in between set: 1m 30s

"So I've recently been training weighted pullups, and I'm curious about what I should be doing. With normal pullups, I always start from a dead hang, explode up, hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang, then repeat. Ive had no issues doing them like this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups.

Now for weighted pullups, I want to train these for max strength so sub 5 reps. I was unsure as to how to do the rep. Of course I will start in a dead hang, but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load? Or would I be safer lowering until my arms are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. This is how I currently perform them. Of course I would like to go back into a dead hang and pull from there like I do with unweighted pullups, however my main concern is that over time will this damage my joints or the structures in my shoulders or elbows etc?

Any help/advice regarding this is much appreciated!!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello squad, how is everyone doing? Hope you'all doing okey and training hard. I'm going to post like I did last year with my year progression (had to delete my other account srry) to show that this sub got everything you need to train. (Please be patiente with my english, mistakes will be made)

A bit of background: 27M started doing calisthenics 2,5 years ago exclusively, I don't lift weights except for weighted excercies. I have scoliosis and a herniated disc and that somehow is the only inspiration I need to train. If I'm in shape I don't have any problems but when I stop... oh boy, I can't even stand still for 10 min.

Anyways, after a surgery 3 years ago I started doing the Recommended routine on and off. Got the hang of it and at one point i said to myself ""This s\*\*t really works"" and I took it serious.

Took me about a year to complete all progressions doing 3 times a week with the classic “3 pairs and a triplet”. Then I switched to a full body routine with my specific goals (handstand and manna) about 6 months. I was still on begginer levels acording to Overcoming gravity 2.0

From the last 7 months I've doing push pull leg with a lot of success and I think is neither better or worse, just different. I was very used to doing full body and I was aching more when I switched but then it gave me more energy to focus on less things and that's when things started to shine.

If needed will upload my routine and my goals, just wanted to share what you can achieve if you set your mind and I aprove 200% this subreddit.

"I ask in bodyweight because it seems to me that people who rely more on bodyweight exercises and calisthenics in general have more disciplined training regiments...and it makes sense because without a disciplined regiment you wouldn't achieve very much gains through bodyweight exercises.

As for me, I was a load-up-as-much-weigh-as-possible-and-fck-form guy for well over a decade before i transitioned over to a strict bodyweight routine later in life and saw an explosion in my gains and physique...

But as disciplined as i am in the gym, every other aspect of my life is out of control...from the women, the booze, the gambling and so forth","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello calisthenics athletes, I'm currently doing 4 sets of +5kg weighted pull ups (aprox. 10 reps) and trying to improve both numbers and/or weight, whatever comes first.

Is this a good approach for harder exercises later on? Just checked and exercises like archer and typewriter pull ups seem to be harder than my shoulders-width weighted pull ups, mainly because the former two use the lats more compared to the later.

Is this a good way of training? Taking into account muscle ups and front lever, which are even more advanced exercises, need more strength and technique.

So what do I do? Do I keep pushing for more strength or should I do a combination of sets? Weighted set + wide grip set + chin up set + archer set, etc?

The same applies to other exercises like dips (weighted dips vs russian and imposible dips) push ups (HSPU vs archer/one hand push ups) and so on.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So recently, for the first time, I saw someone (with my own eyes) do a two finger planche! This completely blew me away. It’s one thing to see such things on Instagram (which is still rare) but seeing it in person was something else.

It got me so hyped and motivated. I know I’m really far away from that but I was wondering, what is the best way to strengthen your fingers for such things?

I tried push-ups on my fingers and managed to do a few reps on 3 fingers but that was kinda painful. I need to harden my fingers somehow I guess. But at the same time I’m afraid of injuring myself, so I wanna start slowly.

As for the planche, I’m currently learning the straddle planche and it will take a while to even do that properly. But I wanna start at least doing maybe two finger push ups soon.

Any advice or experience appreciated!

By the way, here’s the video of the 2 finger planche guy:

"Hi. 34 years old male here. Currently at 90kgs. In an effort to control my blood sugar (T1D) and stay healthy, I started the bodyweight exercises. I am doing the BWF Primer right now (Week 2, Day 9). Healtly diet is also on the list.I may be a bit too much focusing on little things, but if it can prevent future injury, why not right? ) My question is which grip is better when doing the table row, parallel to your body or perpendicular?

I don't have any suitable table because the legs are in the middle. I also read here that the row is a 'must do exercise'. I know the are many alternatives to replace the table,.For now I am doing it with dumbell pull and in the meantime I am designing a sort of specialized apparatus to do it properly. As of right now I am in the position to make it better (if any) and I also have the ability to make the grip orientation any direction I want.

I have seen the barbell with parallel grip where you kinda stand in the middle when lifting it. If the regular barbell is good, why is there other type of grip for it?

If you guys can give me some pointer about the grip orientation it will be badass!

Thanks in advance. Of course the equipment I design will double as clothing dump. Haha.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I’m 18 started body weight training a little less than a year ago. Gained about 15 pounds over the summer doing primarily strength focus that included weighted 5x5 pull-ups on rings every session.

Getting to college I’ve barley found time to workout, lost the 15 pounds I gained, and finally got back to it about 3 weeks ago after about 2 months off. Being back on it I’ve found that my right (dominate side) lat is very tight in pull-ups and I don’t feel my left much at all. Is this a muscle imbalance, engagement, or technique issue?

"It’s been about 5 months since I started training with my bodyweight and since this post is about my abs and core strength, I’m gonna focus on that. Just to give a little background: Starting out I could barely do leg raises and I couldn’t hold my lower back to the ground (initiating pelvic tilt). HOWEVER, I’ve improved a lot since then and I haven’t really felt the need to max out on leg raises on the ground as I do them hanging or on parallel bars. The problem is, I never really feel like my lower abs are working as hard as my upper, for example, after a 30s L-sit I will feel my upper abs “burning” and being much harder but feeling nearly nothing in my lower. I think this is probably related to genetics and that my body might store more fat in my lower abdomen since they also differ in definition. Any advice?

Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello, I'm currently trying to come up with a good progression towards archer pushups as an intermediate goal, with the final goal of being able to do clean one-arm pushups. I can currently do 3x8 diamond pushups, and 2 to 3 clean reps max of archer pushups, but I can't do those for sets yet. I have a hard time finding a good progression towards those : archers with hands elevated on a table (+70cm) are too easy while archers with hands on chairs (+40cm) are an absolute pain because the chairs keep sliding away from each other, and I unfortunately don't really have the correct setup to be able to do rings pushups.

What are some good progressions that can help me build up strength to finally do archer pushups for sets ? Note that I have equipment to do weighted dips (which I plan to start doing in a few weeks anyway), but I don't know how well they carryover to unilateral pushups.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi guys,

For the past few years I had done very minimal exercise, and a lot of computer work & gaming. However, this year I decided to change this and started working out as hard as I could. Unfortunately soon after I started getting significant **right side chest pain**. I went to the physio using an accident compensation scheme in NZ.

The physio said it was just **right chest tightness** so gave me exercises to do, but he also did a lot of massaging on the affected chest - deep muscle release I think he called it? Anyway I focused on stretching the right chest muscle and eventually the chest pain disappeared. It's worth noting that during this time I didn't stretch the left chest at all.

However, now my **right scapula is snapping** very loudly when I move my pull my shoulders backwards. Initially the physio gave me scapula exercises with bands and stuff and it didn't really help. He eventually discharged me though because he didn't see the snapping scapula as a big problem.

I do want to fix this problem though.

When I look at myself front on in the mirror, and pull both of my shoulders backwards, it actually looks like the **right side retracts much more than the left** ?

I wonder if I overstretched my right chest and now there's an imbalance that's causing the snapping scapula ? Whether that's even possible I don't know... Any opinions would definitely be appreciated!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been doing casual calisthenics for a while now, almost a year, but i came to a point where i'm no longer able to progressively do more reps. 

With chin-ups for example, i do an all-in first set, then my second and third set have half of the first set in terms of reps and my fourth one is basically just hanging on the bar. And since 3 months ago or so i noticed that my progress has been really, really slow, almost unable to get + 1 rep in the first set even after that long. 

That lead me to think what might be wrong, and considering that my diet is not that bad and i really try my best in each workout, i thought it may be happening because i focus too much in the first set, so, would it be better if i even out my sets and do the same amount of reps in each one?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I am currently following a routine where I do mainly three exercises. I workout 6 days a week. My sessions are very short. Because I struggle to convince myself to workout after a hectic office day. I have read the atomic habit book and incorporating some of the techniques from the book. I believe a lil every day will take me far in the journey.

"Hi, I am 19 years old, 178cm(5'10'') and weight 85kg(187lbs). I've recently started doing a watered-down version of the RR routine because I can't afford to go to the gym for a couple of reasons. This is what I do:

SUPERSET: Chin-ups - 3x5 + Dips - 3x7 + 3 min rest  
SUPERSET: Inverted Rows - 3x10 + Decline Push-ups - 3x10 + 3 min rest  
Parallel Bars Leg Raises(Leg raises from the starting position of a dip) - 3x15 + 3 min rest

Problem is, I seem to get really bad headaches after doing the Leg Raises. Today especially was terrible. I finished my workout and was on the verge of puking(something which I haven't done in like 9 years). 

Thing is, these headaches happen almost always, although today was by far the worst one. I'd say I get a headache every 4/5 times after doing core work. Needless to say, it's very annoying.

So, do you guys have any suggestions for me to try so that I don't get a headache?

My current hypothesis is that I get a headache because I work out first thing in the morning, fasted. I am going to try eating in the morning before working out and to see if that solves it.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I feel limited by my spine but not only also my ankles. I can maintain a full squat position for long without any problem and I pride myself for usually being a pretty flexible guy.

Is it normal ? Are there any regression I should do before doing these ones ? Cause they pretty hard for a warm up.(no tiring or anything just hard to do).

"Hi everyone! 2022 is coming up and I would be grateful for your advice on setting new fitness goals. I am in my late 30s F, and have been practicing calisthenics for about 6 years. I can do max 11 strict basic pull ups and 19 push ups per minute (in decent form). 

What I’d like to hear from you is how do you set your fitness goals — in terms of how many reps you can achieve in order to be considered ‘good’, ‘average’. Or ‘excellent’. Do you compare with your peers in the same age range? Or do you refer to some kind of standard basic performance benchmarks like for the military or marines?

How do you know/decide when you should stop aiming for a higher max rep? 

I tried to Google this but can’t really get quality information. I think the members in this community would have really practical advice and philosophy for me! Thanks so much.

EDIT: Reason I am asking is because I have always been practicing ‘free style’. I have no regiment or system to get better, just do whatever I feel like on a particular day. I don’t set a specific number of reps, sets and rest time. I only try to max out my rep once in a while to know if I improved. Probably I am progressing slower than I could have, compared to having a systemZ For 6 years it’s been fine as my max reps gradually went up, but I am questioning if I should continue aiming  for increasing reps as it seems a never ending goal.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I finished my first week of C25k. I will start Week 2 tomorrow but I was thinking of adding in the Primer.

My concern is the following: Despite finishing the first week of C25k, I don’t think I have a good cardio base. After every run, I feel completely destroyed gasping for water (though slightly less so with every run I take).

Despite the fact that I feel good after a couple of bodyweight exercises (like a massage you do on yourself), I worry that if I do the exercises on the days I’m not running, because of my couch potato-level cardio stamina and physique, I could be disrupting any potential gains by not resting.

Should I:
A) Finish the C25k to Week 9 (the final week) first and then start on BWFP Primer. In this case, I would make my schedule one of the following:

         1. M: BWFP
             T: Cardio
            W: BWFP
             T: Cardio
             F: BWFP
             S: Rest
             S: Rest

        2.  M: BWFP + Cardio
             T: Rest
            W: BWFP + Cardio
             T: Rest
             F: BWFP
             S: Rest
             S: Rest

B) Start implementing BWFP now with the bw + cardio schedule in the BWF faq.

- 3 sets of lateral dumbbell raises, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of one legged squats, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of dumbbell curls, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of levitation crunches, 12 reps per set
- 3 sets of bicycle crunches, 30 reps per set
- 3 sets of that exercise you do with dumbbells to target the muscle connecting your shoulders and neck, 15 reps per set

"Hi, 14M here.

So, I have been doing BWF for the past several months, almost an year.

 I started off with not being able to do a single rep of pushups. But I have progressed a lot, like getting one arm pushup, not the best form but I still work on it with archers, and getting pistol, etc. However, when I started I was doing NextWorkout's (or Igor voitenko) workout programme to start off. Afterwards, in the summer, I decided to switch to Push/Pull routine and I haven't tried RR ever in my life. I have seen some improvements to my physique too. I am still doing the Push/Pull/Legs routine, BWF style. But, I was thinking if I should switch to the RR instead. 

My main goal is to build muscle but get stronger too. But is it a little late for me to get the benefits out of RR now, as I having been doing Push Pull split? If I switch to it, will I increase my chances of achieving my goals in a shorter timeframe? 

One more thing: I do not have a pull up bar, I might get one for Christmas but I do have a resistance band which I use for biceps, legs and back.

In case you guys might want to know, I do not intend to show off or anything:

I can do 10 pull ups, bar to almost sternum, I try to go as explosive as possible.

I can rep out more or less 10 pistols if I am warmed up properly.

I can do 11 to 12 Archer pushups on each side too, if properly, successfully warmed up.

* 15 x close-grip incline pushups 
* 15 x dip crunches / L-Sit Crunch (don't know the name for this)

Hey, 

I’m concerned if I’m at a higher risk of injury by doing pull ups in this manner, since  I’m someone who just started working out again, after almost a year.

I just started working out last week, going on two. My goal is general strength & athleticism for sports and every day activities.

My issue is, I can only choose one item as my bar station. My choices are either two parallettes that go up to 52” max (I’m 5’10 to 11”), or a pull bar that goes up to 81” tall.

I’d go with the pull up bar and rings, but that’d mean I have to give up weighted dips, which I’d assume is putting me at a strength gaining disadvantage since weighted pull ups use significantly less weight than dips.

Also, will l-sit pull ups limit the realistic potential amount of external load that I can add on compared to tactical pull ups? If so, would you suggest weighted horizontal bodyweight rows as my max strength exercise, while using l-sit as a high rep exercise on strength endurance days? 

Side not: I need a compact bar set (not a power tower). I’m looking at two compact brands so far.

So, what do you suggest?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"In my routine I have chin ups, pull ups, diamond push ups, dips, rows and leg raises (for the upper body) and I was wondering if these exercises are ""enough"" for shoulder strength/size or if I should add pike push ups for example.

I know that the RR is made to focus on every muscle as best as it can but I'm slowly getting in the intermediate range and I can't really feel my shoulders sore at all ever (also not seeing much improvement visually), so should I still stick to these exercises or add a few sets of pike push ups to my routine (or any shoulder focused exercise)?

"Hello guys,
I will get straight to the point!
I started calisthenics training about a year ago. Went from 150lbs to 182lbs (5ft10) for which I’am extremly happy and proud. Some of the weight that I gained is probably fat but it doesn’t bother me really. Problem is that in 2 days I’am starting working in a new job which includes alot of physical work and I do not want to loose any weight that I worked soo hard to gain. We get 1 meal in these 8 hours of work but I’am used to eating every 2-3 hours now. I don’t know what to do nor how do I continue gaining weight… anybody in the same situation? Any tips? Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Okay, so a bit of context first. I've been doing pushups for years, consistently getting higher in volume, speed and weight (in a backpack) for about 5 years. During the first while I got pain in most places, shoulders, chest and triceps (maybe even lats). Obviously I expect that. After that initial period of time though, I only ever got pain in my triceps? Nothing else hurt anymore, I thought, 'oh it's probably just taking longer to develop' but NO. I refuse to believe after over 4 years of doing this exercise, that my triceps are still ""just weak"", surely there is something wrong right? Anyone else experience this, if so, how did you fix it? It's not the same pain as I get in other muscles or even when I do triceps based excersizes like dips or skullcrushers, it's sharper and js really impeding my performance.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi guys. Not related to bodyweight fitness specifically, but a question I've always wondered about.  
We all know that if you want to gain weight you need to eat more than you use and vice versa.  
But what is the difference between 2 people in these cases.  
Both people are 75 kg.   
Let's say one of them has a tdee of 2400 calories and exercises normally.  
The other one however is extremely active and has a tdee of 3500.  
Both eat enough to maintain.  


What is the difference between the two? One of them is doing a lot more exercise than the other. Would they have different body composition? Strength? Endurance?  


What if they were cutting or bulking?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Today, I was looking for new workouts on the Internet, and I came to a seemingly good article by Mens Health. However, after a quick google search apparently it is not a good source of workouts since apparently "" For recommendations from Men's Health, evidence **supported approximately 23% of the 80 recommendations**, while evidence was unclear, nonexistent, or contradictory for approximately 77% of the recommendations"". I run into this situation a lot. One site says crunches are a good workout, experts say they are garbage. Another says sit-ups are good, experts also say they are garbage. Surprisingly everybody seems to agree that planks are good although I'm sure in a few years they will be seen as garbage too. There is just so much conflicting information.

So, are there any good reliable sites with workouts that actually do something? Either recommend sites with workouts that are actually effective, sites to avoid, or workouts that work for you. I trust the various workout communities on Reddit more than I trust the 295983963959 workout sites and the Google ""experts"".

"Hi everyone I've been doing bodyweight fitness for 8 months in this time I have been learning alot more about my body and capabilities along with my strength and weaknesses. But I still consider myself new because I have much to learn.  

I have a strange issue and looking for any information because I don't know how to explain it to other people for them to really understand what I'm saying. 

Example: 

I can easily do 5 x 20 push ups at a steady pace with a 3 min rest period between each set and it won't cause more than a minor tiredness near the end. And i will be able to continue to do more push exercises. If I reduced the rest time to 2 min 30 seconds I will be burning out by the 3rd set.  And it will burn out my arms to be useless for the rest of the day.

Same thing happens when going for speed. If I took my time to do 20 push ups it wouldn't affect me much. If I am trying to do 20 push ups fast It will burn out my arms to be useless for the rest of the day. 

How do I fix this and does anyone have an explanation for this? Why is there such a dramatic chang.  Sorry I am still new and can't find much information about this.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Been watching the most recent video of FitnessFAQs ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpaRMco0jV8)) on benefits of chin-ups and started to wonder what is the proper starting grip of a ring chin-up (as opposed to the bar one)?

Do you start supinated from all the way down or do you start pronated like the pull-up and just rotate your hand more on the way up than you would with a ring pull-up?

I find this question especially interesting since the rings are my only pulling setup - I don't have a pull-up bar, so can't do ""classical"" chin-ups.

Bonus question - I've been thinking about adding chin-ups as an easier (at least to me they're noticeably easier) ""progression"" after doing pull-ups, to rack up some vertical pulling volume when I no longer can do pull-ups with strict form. What do you think?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Anyway, I’d like to get back into calisthenics.  I’ve been on a fitness journey for about a year now, I started with only cardio and slowly got into calisthenics and looked the best I ever did only a few months into my journey. Then I made my way onto fitness tiktok which had me feeling terrible bc I wasn’t lifting heavy… so I started to. But I quickly realized that with my circumstances, getting to the gym really isn’t possible for me (which is okay!!) 
Moving on. I’ve decided to start my calisthenics journey again. My question is… 

How much can a girl change her body through only at home workouts/calisthenics? I’m feeling a little discouraged because I’ve not found anyone online with jaw dropping transformations or anything like that. 
My goal is to lose body fat and to gain some lean muscle mass. I don’t need to be a beef ball, that dream has died (maybe one day though) but to just achieve that healthy toned look throughout my entire body :)
I’d love to know about some female calisthenics influencers if y’all know of any!!!

^ I did this thrice a week with a 40min HIIT boxing workout twice a week (total workout days=5/week). Ofcourse there were a few weeks when I worked out only twice/week.


But now, I have busy months ahead and I don't want to stop progressing. I can manage working out thrice a week. The routine I've decided to follow is from the 8x3 app. 

I was wondering if this is a good way to keep my progress up. It'd be great to have an opinion from the experienced.

How I got into calisthenics?
I had gained some weight during the COVID months and I didn't like that. So I started working out strictly and decided to never stop staying active. I started working out properly 8-9 months back, lost ~10kg in the first 3-4 months with cardio after which I began training for strength.

"As the title says, I have an issue with elbow position during my pullups. When I do my pullups I keep my elbows very tucked, sort of like when you do a pushup with your elbows tucked. I was watching a video and noticed that everyone seems to flare their elbows out while they are doing pullups, nothing like what I am doing. Whenever I try to flare my elbows out, I can't even do half a pullup, which is frustrating.

I have realized that I can't seem to keep my shoulders pushed down and back towards the end of my pushup, they rise up and there isn't a flat line from shoulder to shoulder anymore. Instead of my shoulders being in line with the base of my neck, they seem to be around the halfway mark on my neck

I have a feeling that these two things are connected, and I would like to correct my form (if my form is incorrect). So I guess my question is, how can I do my pullups with my elbows flared out like how other people do it? Should I go back to the basics and start with negatives? Or does it even matter? I can generally do about 10 pullups with my elbows tucked in, if that helps. Thank you in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello, i need some clarification about a thing in pullups, i do the entire movement, and come back down and unlock my shoulder blades every time to do another one.

I saw that my friends (that can do a higher number of them than i do) dont seem do go fully down and extend their arms, instead they go down enough not to unlock their shoulder blades again each time.

They tell me that im doing the right movement, but in my fashion, i feel like im wasting my strength in constantly reopening by fully extending my arms.

Who is correct here? Should i learn to unlock them once in the 1st pullup and then keep them locked, or should i keep going full extension and unlocking them each time?

Now i have new work and i cant train everyday, so i created myself fullbody routine every second day based on exercises i did on my PPL routine.

"Hi,

I'm tracking my energy consumption(Apple Watch) and macro nutrition(Yazio). There is something I don't get:

Depending on different sources for gaining muscle, it is common knowledge that you should eat about 1,5-2g protein per kg body weight for gaining muscle. So there are absolute values by body weight. 

But my nutrition tracking app(Yazio) says relative values, for a normal day with needs for 2000kcal:

40% carbs: 800kcal = 195g  
35% protein: 700kcal = 171g  
25% fat: 500kcal = 54g

My goal is a lean-muscle healthy body, not massive mass, so I am following something between a lean-bulk or ""main-gain"" strategy for a healthy body composition.

But what about intensive days? Usually I need about 2000kcal-2500kcal per day but on intensive days(about 3-4 times a week) with long hiking or bike rides I need easily more than 3500kcal. **Should I stick to the relative calculation? That could mean for 3500kcal:**

40% carbs: 1400kcal = 341g  
35% protein: 1225kcal = 300g  
25% fat: 875kcal = 94g

**Or should I stick to an absolute amount of protein like body weight(80kg) \* 2g = 160g and fill up the remaining energy with carbs and fat?**

Typical week:

|Day|Training|Energy consumption|
|:-|:-|:-|
|So, Tue, Thu|Upper Body Bodyweight + Cycling|3500kcal|
|Mo, Wed, Fr|Legs Bodyweight|2200kcal|
|Sat|Hiking|3500kcal|

For example because the body cannot adopt this amount of protein and it is **not healthy for the kidneys in the long term?**

Sry for the stupid question, but I could not get which is the better and healthy way. With my nutrition in the last months I could easy stick to the ""relative-strategy"" but I'm not sure, that is healthy in the long term?  
Thank you for your opinions :)","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Recently I've been looking back at my progress over the past few months and I am realizing that my push bodyweight exercises haven't been progressing much. I do Pull/Push/Legs twice a week. On pull days, I do pull-ups, dumbbell rows, and bicep curls. On push days, I do PPPUs, pike pushups, and ring dips.

My problem is that it is much easier for me to progress on pull days because I can easily add a couple pounds to dumbbell rows and curls whenever I feel like it. With PPPUs and pike pushups, I feel like I am unable to progress as fast compared to if I was using dumbbells.

My idea is to split my push days into two different workouts. To continue progressing on PPPUs and pike push ups, I will do those on my first push day of the week. On the second push day, I will do weighted pushups and ring dips(weighted whenever I am strong enough).

Is this a good idea for me to continue gaining strength while also progressing towards planche and handstand pushups?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"[Eagle loops](https://imgur.com/5DODID4)

Hi guys, so, in a typical day I walk past my pull up bar and do a few dead hangs. (Hoping to loosen tight lats). I heard about these loops and thought it would help strengthen my fingers? Perhaps have some carryover into climbing, maybe even some weird kind of conditioning?

Figured why not add the Eagle loops whilst hanging as a 2 in 1. 

Sounds like a good idea. What should I expect strength wise or carryover wise?

E.g, for my lat stretching, I'm walking past and doing a 1 minute (ish) dead hang, adding the straps whilst doing that would enable me to hang AND get some kind of finger conditioning.

I  think this is a bummer and i have yet to discover an Android app that lets me logg whatever i want and configure and restructure my own program as i want. (any suggestions please let me know).

As a developer i sat out to create this app myself, it has no name yet but it allows you to setup the same exercise in multiple ways as well as letting you log whatever you want in whatever way you want.

I really enjoy rock climbing and I also enjoy doing the RR so I appreciate any advice on how to do both. A couple strategies I can think of is alternating between just rock climbing one week and just the RR the following week, or doing the RR one to two times a week with rock climbing one to two times a week.

"Hey everyone, I've been doing the RR for over a year and really enjoyed the progress I've made. Recently, I've noticed a slight pain in my right shoulder when doing certain exercises, so I backed off bodyweight to let it heal and replaced it with a routine of 30 mins of yoga in the morning and a swim at lunchtime most weekdays. On the weekend I'll do some yoga on one of the days. My shoulder has started to feel better from this. Additionally, I've found the routine much easier to maintain and other stressed areas of my body (hips and lower back) also feel much better.

I'd like to eventually reincorporate some bodyweight elements back into this routine as I don't really want to lose strength, but I'm not overly concerned with gaining loads of additional strength. The exercises I'd like to maintain are pull ups and pushups mostly. 

So I'm thinking I will either do a short routine to do after yoga on three of the days. I'd like to keep this routine to about 30 minutes. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to structure this exercise? As most of the routines on here are over an hour.

I'm thinking perhaps a really short split routine.

Day 1 - Push
Archer / planche - 3x8
Diamond - 3x8
Dips - 3x8
Decline - 3x8

Day 2 - Pull
Pull ups - 3x8
Bodyweight bicep curls - 3x8

Day 3 - Shoulders
Handstand practice

I've cut out all fast food and have built a consistent balanced diet, and I've been working out every single day for the last 2 years (have made some considerable progress vs. where I started, as one should expect); yet for some reason even with what feels like consistent efforts, I can't seem to undo the effects of sitting in front of a computer for 10+ hours/day for 6-7~ years straight. My whole neck/upper chest/upper back area just seems to be all sorts of screwed. Despite focusing a _lot_ on chest, I still struggle to properly stretch and engage it when needed. It has lagged behind my back which is very big relatively, and I believe this to be a result of the postural issues I'm speaking of. My neck of course goes forward, unless I focus on correcting it, but I suspect those with good posture are not constantly concentrating their mind their necks lmfao.

I've tried neck exercises and stretches in order to build strength in the SCM; haven't made any notable changes. I began doing a decent amount of trap work this year (not through bodyweight fitness.. mostly hex bar shrugs at max DL weight)—some progress has been made there, but again, nothing dramatic enough to fix the problem.

To do this, you need a pair of straps. You can use martial art belts. I bought mine for 5 bucks. If you don't have a plate loader, you can just loop the strap through the weight plates.

Benefits of this setup:
* Allows you to go down as deep as you want.
* The weight hangs directly below your upper back and chest.
* Doesn't cause discomfort in your lower back.
* You can go extremely heavy without needing a spotter like with a bench press.

I have done reps with 65 kg of plates hanging off me like this. It's definitely the best way to go heavy on chest at home.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been working out for a while and I've noticed that bodyweight exercises give me a better workout than weight training. 

However, I would like to know if I mainly do calisthenics, will it be possible to get bigger? Not necessarily very large, but overall bigger as I'm more lean ""hard gainer"" and shorter. I do have dumbbells and a pull up/dip station. 

I usually incorporate both. So I will generally do dumbbell rows right before pull ups etc. Any good routine to incorporate both? I will start to slowly get back into working out next year in January since I was unable to the past 3 months.

"I'm a 58kg 5""5 male.I've been thinking about getting back to the RR after a pretty long break. And with the title I don't actually mean I'm completely throwing progressive overload out the window. Also my goal is hypertrophy.

And when I did the RR I didn't really understand the concept of progressive overload, especially with bodyweight stuff so I just basically did the same amount of reps for the 2 months I did the RR. What would have happened to my muscles hypertrophy wise? Would nothing change, excluding the newbie gains?

Is just training to failure enough for hypertrophy? What are your thoughts and could someone educate me a bit better in this as I've looked around the subreddit and there's nothing that actually addressed my specific question I guess. Is it a dumb thing to ask?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"5'11, 78kg. The goal is pretty much just to keep getting stronger, keep gaining muscle.

Started with the recommended routine, but it was taking too long each day so I switched to a PPL 3 day split that I saw on the sub. I like being complimented on my arms, so there's an extra arms section in the workout. It goes like this:

- Rest period is 2 minutes between sets.

- 7 minute Athlean-X ab workout every other day after PPL workout.

-----------------------

- PUSH:

Weighted ring dips (5kg) 8*5

RTO pushups 8*5

- PULL: 

Chest to bar pullups 7*5

Ring rows 8*5

- LEGS + ARMS

Pistol Squats 5*5

Reverse Nordic Curls (with hands on head, it seems to make it harder to pull back up again) 8*5

15kg Bicep Curls - 9*5

15kg Hammer Curl into Overhead Press 7*5

--------------

- PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:

I am currently trying to get to 8 reps of an exercise for 5 sets before I progress to the next exercise. However, on certain exercises I've sort of maxed out and don't know where to progress further.

Weighted ring dips are fine, I have a weight belt that I can keep adding to. 

The RTO pushups - I don't know how to make them harder/what to progress to. Could I elevate my legs on a chair to make it harder? I don't have a weight vest.

The pullups I can just add weight to once I hit 8 reps.

I don't know what I can do with the ring rows. I'm already elevated beyond the horizontal.

I'm also not sure how I can progress the Reverse Nordic Curls. I'd like to progress to normal Nordic Curls but I can't figure out a way to do them.

Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Curious if you guys have noticed similar things. I did a large variety of shoulder exercises, and it feels like my performance with pullups has gone noticeably down when compared to per say a bench/dip day. Currently shoulder strength is the priority.

However something i do notice is that doing chest first has never really caused too much of an issue, tho with lots of shoulder pressing/hs work the performance definetely goes down in relation to what it was if i had benched instead of shoulder pressed pre pullup M bench vs M shoulder press and then pullups tuesday.

Might be worth doing pullups at the start of the week at some point if i wanna see my peak performance.

Have you guys noticed a similar experience?

I am curious if anyone else here has had similar results, on a similar program.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Past: tried just using a pullup bar, and I could get up to 17 pullups chin to bar down to almost arm lock out ( \~170 degrees) but could never get muscle up. tried using cossack squat to get to pistol and many other bodyweight variation squats but decided just to get gym membership to do weighted calisthenics.

routine: everyday full body workout, consisting of weighted squats 5x8, weighted pullups 5x8, pseudo planche pushup

weighted pullups: currently lifting a 35lbs plate 5x8, usually get to at least 6 reps but go for 8

weighted squats: currently squatting 165lbs 5x8, 99/100 times hit 8 reps, think I should up the weight

pseudo planche pushup: measure from wall to base of hands: currently at 105cm to base of hands 5x8. I put a dumbell between my legs so I dont tip over forward (is this effective or taking away shoulder gains?)

"Often I see people learning the front lever or front lever pull up (rarely the FL pull up, though) through just the use of weighted pull ups and row variations. I know everyone can't do this and automatically gain the move(s), but it's an option for some.

Regarding the planche, though. Does the same concept of indirect training to learn the move apply here? For example, gaining the planche or straddle planche through the use of handstand push ups and push up variations only? 

In theory, it sounds like both of them would work the same, but I feel like the concept applies more to the front lever than the planche. I would love hear your insight on this and more opinions on ""free gains"".","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hello, i have a question. I train calisthenics for like year now, i was training with weights in the gym before. I dont train for skills, but for hypertrophy/strenght, so im progressing by adding weight. I follow PPL split and i personally like less exercises with higher volume (so 1 variation of vertical pull, 1 variation of horizontal etc.). Same for my push-day, i do 1x dips and 1x push-ups. The thing is, as i said i train mainly for hypertrophy, so with just dips and regular push-ups i will definitely grow good chest, but im just missing those incline benches from gym for upper chest ( i mean every muscle building program has incline pushing).

With calisthenics, for upper chest pushing, there are decline push-ups. Some people say its upper chest exercise like incline dumbell press for example, some say its harder variation of regular push-ups, some say they completely sucks because shoulders and triceps are heavily activated and you get almost simillar upper chest activation with regular push-ups.

I tried them and i feel like they are more ""compound"" and just less isolating than incline presses, but they are still target that upper chest little bit more than regular push-ups i guess. 

So my question is, do you think i can do dips+decline push-ups on PUSH day, could i do decline push-ups completely instead of regular ones, or the upper chest activation is not that big with decline a i will be better with sticking to regular push-ups ? What do you think ? Thanks","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I have been working out my glutes for the past 4-5 weeks and I have run into a couple of questions.

1. I have been getting very little to no activation doing Fire Hydrants, Side lying abduction, Standing abduction (on the standing leg I do feel engagement), or knee planking abduction. I do notice I'm slightly stronger then when I started, I can do more reps. But I feel little to no glute activation. Compared to normal Donkey kicks or Straight Leg, I get very noticeable activation here and making substantial progress.
2. Like I mentioned, normal donkey kicks and straight legs I do get activation, but since I'm getting stronger I noticed I'm not getting the burn until 1,5 minute to 2 minutes in. Resulting in my entire routine being 75 minutes long. So my goal is using weights to shorten the workout, so I only need to do 1 min of a specific exercise per leg instead of 2 minutes.

"Hey guys,

I've been using the AthleanX Sixpack Shuffle for almost two years now.  
For those, who don't know, there are lots of exercises on four skill levels (most of them bodyweight, some utilizing resistance bands, dumbells or a chinup bar) and you can either follow a six-week-programme or just shuffle exercises within your skill level. An ab workout takes about 10 minutes and I just do them when I'm not working out that day.

In the last weeks, however, I've been following a few ab workout vids (mostly AthleanX) and they claim all the time that ""this is gonna be your favorite ab workout from now on"".

But it isn't main problem. As I know, this program is for 3 days per week and I worked at this regime, but know it's not possible and I have to attend the gym 4 times per week 1,5-2 hours, don't ask me why, just because.

A) at 4 day i'm doing all exercises as usual, but with really low weights. It gives me opportunity to master the technique of exercises and doesn't demand from my organism a lot of resources.
B) at 4 day i'm doing exercises which aren't connected to a program and train those muscles which doesn't work, while I am working out according the 5*5, yet I don't know which is that exercises, because I feel like every muscle is working when I'm training as usual.
C) change the plan, but really hard, from basical basics but I really don't want to do that.
Thus, this is my situation now. Pleas write your ideas, if you know what exercises I can in B) variant or programs which are like 5*5, write it.

"TaoPhysique is the only channel where I saw this exercise mentioned: [deep ring pushups](https://youtu.be/bZU7KlE-TV0?t=295).

He claims that it trains your whole upper body, which makes sense since it combines a pushup with a bicep curl, especially if you go deeper than him in the video, to the point where your arms are straight and then you curl them back. 

But does this hit your back well enough? Is there an upper muscle that's not hit well enough  by this but is usually hit well in a routine? Could someone do 20 sets of this in a week and no upper body exercise instead of doing 20 sets of push and 20 sets of pull, assuming the aim is hypertrophy and strength? For example, could the strength from this movement alone transfer well enough to other exercises like pull-ups, dips, handstand pushups, planche, etc. ?

2-[https://imgur.com/a/ndszuLO](https://imgur.com/a/ndszuLO)

Cons: Its a bit expensive eventho money is not a issue. I think it would wobble when doing exercises on it. I would have to do pull-ups and muscle-ups in an L position because of height.

"1) for those who have built decent muscles and size (not necessarily bodybuilder style muscles) what are some good calisthenics routines? Keep in mind I also have set of dumbbells with adjustable weights so I don't mind those being added to routine.

2) what are some warm ups for calisthenics oriented exercises?

Equipment I have at home:

Adjustable dumbbells that go up to 12 kg. Each plate on the dumbbell can come off and weights 1.5-2.5 kg. I also have one metal dumbbell that weights 25 pounds. 

Dip and pull up station.

Resistance band for assisted dips or pull ups (although I don't use it much but I felt if it helps with the form then why not). 

Might soon also purchases a weighted vest. 

I am starting to get back into my workout (used to workout 3-4 times a week) but I haven't been for a few months. I would appreciate tips and tricks for working out. Is there any other equipment u guys recommend I invest in?

Thank you!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello all,

I’ve recently started training in caloric surplus in an attempt to put on mass. So far it’s been a pretty slow process. I’ve been eating in average 4000 calories a day supplementing with creatine  and I’ve gained about 2 pounds in a month. I lead a fairly active lifestyle working part time physical labor and body weight exercises for about an hour 5-6 days a week. My TDEE was calculated at 3200 calories at 6’3 200 lbs. I eat pretty clean and I eat the same things everyday. My Chronometer states I intake 125g of fiber/day. 

I’m happy with my physique so far but I would like to put more mass on my shoulders. I’m currently interested in the pursuit of the so called golden-ratio for aesthetics Are pike push-ups my best bet in the body weight realm for shoulder growth? I’ve been trying to dial in which version works best for me and I’ve been mostly practicing these two:

Standard: https://imgur.com/a/pcfnlEo

Decline full rom: https://imgur.com/a/gad1gIF

I find it pretty hard to progressively overload the decline version. In the position shown I can manage 5 sets of 7 reps. Are these effective? Should I scale back to regular pike push-ups? My goal is to be able to perform sets of handstand push-ups in order to best target the medial delts. Right now I can get 3 belly against a tree but they are super taxing, especially on my serratus strangely enough. Are there any other exercises I should experiment with as far as shoulder growth goes?

I’d like to stick to body weight exercises. It’s sort of a purist mindset of mine and I know it may be limiting my gains but I do enjoy the challenge. For reference this is how I look now after a pull workout:

"Hello. I’m 19 male, 82kg at around 16-19% bodyfat if this is somehow relevant. I love doing pull ups, they are my favourite callisthenic exercise. I can do 20 pull ups and 23 chin ups, but in order to maintain this I must do at least two sets every day. There are days I just forget about it, or I’m just too busy or tired to do any and it seems like if I skip 2-3 days, I always lose around 4 reps from my PR and it takes around a week to recover it. If I want to improve, then I need to do several sets a day, if not I just stagnate. I’m still mind blown of how easy I lose my pull up skills compared to other exercises. I wonder why is that tho and if it’s for everyone","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"24M 5'9 147lb
How much carryover is there from chin up to pull ups and from push ups to dips?
Since I usually focus on few exercises for relatively long periods of time in order to track progress better.
So for example, I'd like to know what degree of progress could I expect for pull ups while I focus on chin ups.


Also, I'm currently doing GtG with regular not weighted push ups, would it be counterproductive to add dips in the form of ladders workout, alternating between the two?
Or should I stick to one method for all exercises?


Finally, which method is best for any given goal?
Obviously weighted exercises done in the 5-8 reps range are better than cranking out 20+ reps for strength; but for endurance? Would it be more beneficial to do ladders workout, GtG or plain ol' high reps high sets workout?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello everyone, I've been doing a routine inspired by grease the groove for the past 2 weeks. I'm recovering from 2 injuries (with help from PT of course), and rows and pullups are the 2 exercises I can do without triggering some type of pain, so I switched out doing RR 3x a week to doing psuedo-GTG for rows and pullups (EDIT: doing this 3 days a week (MWF) also).

I start out by doing weighted pullups as soon as I wake up, then start a 30 minute timer. I switch to weighted rows as soon as the timer rings, then rinse and repeat alternating the two until it gets close to my bedtime. Once it's within an hour of bedtime I try to do as many reps as possible, then drop-set weightless pullups/rows. My 1 rep max is ~50lbs pullup, and I do 3 reps of pullup/row with 25lb weight vest each set in the 30 minute intervals.

Is this a good way to get stronger and do higher rep ranges for pullups and rows, and also for hypertrophy? I know GTG isn't optimal for hypertrophy since it lacks muscle fatigue, but since I'm going to failure and drop setting at the end of the day after doing quality & quantity the whole day, would this be a decent workout routine for strength and hypertrophy?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello, (19M, 6'4(192cm) 100kg (225lbs).

I've been doing the RR granted on and off for a few months. I've worked up to 20kg 3x5 dips and 10kg 3x5 Pull-Ups. I've also been doing just bodyweight PPPU(hands close to waist) and Inverted Rows(completely parallel) which I've worked up to 3x8.

My current goals are a freestanding handstand (close to that), handstand push-up, tuck front lever and a tuck planche. I'm actually unsure as to why I'm training inverted rows or pppu anymore. I've just kept them there as they are a part of the RR but will either of them actually help me achieve my goals? (I know they obviously won't with handstands). I do recall inverted rows are needed for equal pulling? I forget the exact terminology.

I know doing PPPU is valuable to build shoulder strength (and chest) but would I be better off training static planche movements like planche leans instead of PPPU for straight arm and shoulder strength to achieve a tuck planche and tuck front lever? Could I switch them for pike push-ups even to help with achieving the necessary pushing strength for handstand push ups?

Sidenote: I'm currently cutting down to 85kg. I'd like to train solely for brute strength (I'm already a pretty huge guy).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey :)

I am doing the RR for roughly 2 years now (did it before as well, but with longer breaks in between). Not sure if relevant, but I'm 29, male, 1,90m and 95kg. My current plan (3x/week): 

\- **Standard Warm-up** (Yuri's Shoulder Band Warmup; Squat Sky Reaches; Wrist Prep; 1 min. Hollow Hold; Arch Hand; 1 min. Ring Support Hold; Squads)

\- **Strenght Work**:

* First Pair:
   * 3 x 8 Pull ups on bar
   * 3 x 8 Shrimp Squad (on a yoga block; only knee rouching)
* Second Pair:
   * 3 x 8 Ring Dips
   * 3 x Single Legged Deadlift
* Third Pair:
   * 3 x 13 Horizontal Rows (not on a bar, but with the Dips ""things)
   * 3 x 8 Pseudo Plance Push ups

\- **Core Triplet** (3 x 40 sec. Plank; 3 x 30 sec. Copenhagen Plank with Movement on Hand (not Ellbow); 3 x Arch Body Hold)

\- **20 Min. Yoga / Stretch Program**

I wanted to ask for your opinion on my current routine, since I have the feeling that I could progress more than I do. E.g. I'm doing Horizontal Rows for nearly 1,5 years now and can only increase the number. I also wanted to progress with the Single Legged Deadlift, but I fail to do the Nordic Hamstring (probably wrong band). 

Also I wanted to train for ""human flag"" this year and wanted to use my rest days for it. Do you recommend that? Do you have a specific training plan for the flag which I can follow?

I am quite lucky to have access to a ""calisthenics"" park basically in my home office, so I should be able to do most exercises ([pciture here](https://imgur.com/a/yLFtXuh)). 

Finally I want to use this opportunity and thank you guy, since I am following for quite a while and think that you are doing a great job. :-) :-)

"Hi Fellow Bodyweighters,

Lots of awesome info and threads on this sub. I started doing the RR a month ago and already feel a lot more mobile and limber thanks to some of the warmups and the workout itself. However, I have started feeling some shoulder pain starting around week 4 so I'm taking a week or so off to give the shoulders a break and let them hopefully heal.

For a smidge of background, I'm a 32YO male and more prone to injury than I was before before 30. Typically when doing the RR I've been looking to go for that extra rep every workout so I'm thinking that this combined with volume of hitting the same muscles 3 times a week (an increase for me) contributed to my shoulder issues. I read some stuff on this sub based around the concept of going for cautiously incremental gains and basically taking it easy on the intensity/volume because connective tissues take a lot longer to adapt and heal than muscle. 

To avoid injury in the future with the RR, what are this sub's thoughts on voluntarily increasing reps only every week for example instead of every workout in the spirit of taking it easy on the joints/tendons? So even if I can increase reps on a certain exercise in the same week, I would wait until the next week. Has anyone had experience with doing something like this?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"

I was messing around on my low horizontal bar (between two  chairs) when I started doing the thing in the pic. It looks either like tuck FL rows with very low range of motion and a big pause at the top, or as a simple tuck FL but with arms slightly bent. 

https://youtu.be/lNmIiKi-IF8

I can't train for an actual  tuck FL because the bar is too low so if I keep my arms straight I just lay on the floor. 

Is doing this exercise going to give me any strength or hypertrophy gains or is it a waste of time and I am better off just doing row variations?

"Hello, i need help. Im starting to train calisthenics again, with pure focus on hypertrophy/strenght (goal is to progress through weighted calisthenics instead of harder bodyweight variations). I dont like many variations, i want to keep it simple, so i made routine myself based on other youtube/internet PPL routines. I mainly want to ask, if volume is not too much and maybe if you think its good for hypertrophy/strenght.

PUSH: 5x dips, 3x push-ups, 3x decline push-ups (for more upper chest focus), 3x pike push ups, 3x triceps extensions

PULL: 5x pull-ups, 5x rows, 3x rear delt fly, 3x biceps curl

LEGS: 5x pistol squat, 3x glute bridge, 3x regular squat + some abs

As i said, my main question is about volume, if its not too much, but if you have any ideas on what to add/remove, i will be pleased. Thanks","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I was wondering if someone could gain strength through power yoga. 

I found a YT channel, called ""Breath and Flow"" and the guy, who admittedly is super jacked, has some intense sessions, or so they seem...

I don't care much about the spiritual and emotional aspect of yoga, but since I train at high speeds for running and martial arts, I want to start some more slow paced, though effective strength program. 

I am following the 5x5 stronglifts currently, but I have to work from home a lot, so thought of trying something more convenient...

By this, I don't mean something easy, just something that leaves me energised, make progress, and have progress...

Any input welcome...

"I never liked running for long distances - cardio be damned - I just got too bored with the slow onset of the fatigue. I've always enjoyed sprint workouts in the park, which I stop doing every winter/spring when its to cold/wet, so its a training modality that I can never be as consistent with as I'd like. Previously on treadmills, I would always run 6-minute miles as my cardio workout, but running on treadmills always felt.. weird? On the TrueForm treadmill, I feel like I'm able to 1) run with proper form 2) work my hamstrings out more 3) and run much faster than on a conventional treadmill. **So I am very excited to incorporate this into my training.**   


So,   


1. What are some 5-10 minute running workouts that you would recommend for the end of a workout? 
2. What are some 10-20 minute running workouts that you would recommend as part of a \~40-60 minute HIIT workout? 

Any general advice, recommendations, or tips would be appreciated. I am running mostly to improve my endurance and increase leg size. My legs normally get very muscular from sprint workouts and running 6-minute miles a few times a week. I'm very used to high volume leg training, its my bread and butter (try doing some fencing workouts if you really want a gold medal ass - frog jumps, frog jumps, and more frog jumps!).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I am currently training to increase hypertrophy and strength. Both for reasons related to my sport (acrobatics) and for aesthetic reasons I would like to stop once I have reached some goals of % lean mass and body weight.

Here my question arises, what to do once I have reached the desired weight and lean mass to keep improving? Both from the point of view of diet and training.

I'm looking for protocols or authors who talk about it. If I search for the maintenance phase, I found little or nothing of interest. But I wonder, for example, who does weightlifting or martial arts, once they have reached the weight of their category which regimes they follow?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:   
**Of course once reached the goals a person can keep improving stuff like technique, flexibility, mobility, cardio, etc.**    
**Of course If you stop training and eating enough you will lose your progress**

**The questions are, without gaining any more lean mass weight:**

* **Is it possibile to still improve  strength?** 
* **Maybe improve the aesthetics of muscle composition?** 
* **Is it helpful to do a  little hyper-caloric diet? Or it's better to keep a normo-caloric?**","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi folks,

I have for you some tricks/hacks I use to slow down my bad habits with exercise.

# Squats while brushing your teeth!

**Bad habit**: you brush for a very short time because it's boring.

If you use an electric brush, they usually have a 2 minutes timer. Do squats as you brush your teeth in the morning and at night. You'll actually end up lasting the whole 2 minutes and getting a great workout while at it!

# 7 minutes workout before that bad habit

**Bad habit**: that extra coffee cup, that first beer or alcoholic drink, have that cigarette, etc...

Before doing something you think is not good for you, earn it with a 7 minute workout :). Btw, if you have an iOS device, you can use a free app I wrote (Handstand Quest) with no ads to follow the 7 minute workout.

# Push-ups or core every hour during work day

**Bad Habit**: You work too much. In fact, the work day mostly goes from 8 am to 5 pm with you stuck in your chair or standing.

To get your body moving constantly and avoid back/next injuries, do your favorite exercise (ex: push ups, crunches, squats, stretches, etc..) every one hour throughout the day for as many reps you are comfortable with. Feel free to change it up and keep it to 1 minute max so you keep coming back.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm looking for some assistance with ideas and plans for a backyard DIY pull up bar set. I currently have the typical 4x4 with a pipe in the backyard, it has been good for a few years, but I live in south Louisiana and the sun has just eaten it up.

"Hello everyone, my stats are as follows (so that this post isn’t removed): M 177cm/5’9.5 and 77kg/170lbs. I’ve been lifting weights for several years (been following a structured routine for only the last 1.5 years). I can do bodyweight +150lbs dips so I have a good amount of pushing strength and one arm pushups are not a challenge for my triceps or pecs.

The discussion I want to start comes from the observation that whenever I do one-arm pushups, I feel intense doms in my obliques the next day. This is obviously because of the intense strain on the obliques to prevent the body from twisting and collapsing during the movement. I haven’t felt this much strain on my obliques for any other movement despite training obliques consistently through other exercises such as woodchoppers, windshield wipers, and side planks.

My main question is: does anyone have experience with performing one-arm pushups as an exercise to mainly train and induce hypertrophy in obliques? 

As a followup, is there a similar bodyweight exercise that stresses the obliques as much? Right now, the only ones that comes to my mind (apart from ridiculous moves like one arm front lever or planches) are the human flag or a twisted dragon flag","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I've been practicing handstands for about a year - 4 days a week. The routine is quite simple - 8 minutes of practicing balance and form using walls and 2 minutes of practicing free-standing handstands.

With heck of a lot videos watched on this subject and much more failed attempts of handstands, I've gotten really frustrated since my progress is non-existent.

"Hello,

 I am considering getting a weighted vest for a while now, since I am not interested in building skills by performing more complex moves and I only care about health, aesthetics and strength. I have been training in calisthenics for a few months in a disciplined manner (3 times a week, decent quality training programme, decent quality diet), and a couple years in an undisciplined one (low quality training programmes, weeks and occasionally months of not training due to low morale, low quality diet). 

 I believe that a weighted vest will offer more gains in all aspects, and will achieve it in less time than pure bodyweight exercise, however I want to be sure I am making the right choice and that it is worth it before acquiring one, since they are costly.

 In case it matters, my level as of now is something like this: Can perform 30 consecutive push ups with good form, can perform 50 consecutive squats with good form, can perform 10 consecutive neutral grip pull ups with good form, can perform 100 consecutive sit ups with good form.

 So my questions are:

• Good/best time to start using one? (Right from the beginning vs after you've gotten a level of familiarity with calisthenics).

• How many kilograms should one start with? How many if someone is a beginner, how many if someone is already a calisthenics athlete who wants to advance his level?

• Your personal experiences and choices with weighted calisthenics. Any information is useful. 

 Thanks in advance.

"I thought you all might want to see the setup I've used to train the human flag at home without the need to drill or mount anything. 

I made a short video showing the method, but I'll also write it out below.

https://youtu.be/rTYTEbzy1us

1. Cut a wooden dowel or pvc pipe to the width of your door frame.

2. Wrap the ends of your dowel/pipe in tape or something so that you don't damage your doorframe.

3. Hang gymnastic ring straps (or lashing straps, same thing) from your doorway pull up bar, and adjust them to an appropriate height for your lower hand.

4. Place the dowel/pipe in the doorframe and through both of your strap loops.

5. You're done! It should be constrained in every direction except for pulling toward your body, which allows you to remove it but presents no issue when performing the flag (as the force is directed downward and forward).

You might be able to use this same setup for other stall bar work, but I've never tried it personally.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hi everyone. Skinny 29yo here.  
I have been doing the (old) RR for some years. I do a sedentary day job so I've mostly used the routine to keep in shape and stay healthy, and it has mostly accomplished the job in that regard, but in these years I have built almost 0 muscle and I would like to change that.   
I know most of you are gonna say ""eat more"". Believe me, I have tried. No matter what, this is something that my body or brain refused to do.

I know most of you are going to tell me to eat more and believe me, it's not for a lack of trying. No matter how hard I try, my body/brain won't allow me to.  
Is it still possible to build some muscle without a (great) caloric surplus?

* Mo: A
* Tue: B
* Wed: A
* Thu: B
* Fr: A
* Sat: B
* Sun: Rest

I know it's not ideal to split the recommended routine but a non-ideal workout is better than none and I found it easier to stick to it if I maintain momentum.

**At the moment, my workout looks like this:**

* Bulgarian Split Squad
* Chin Ups
* Bench Dips
* Banded Nordic Curls
* Inverted Row
* Push-Ups
* Ab Wheel
* Pallof Press
* Back extensions

Appreciate your help and looking forward to your suggestions!

**~~EDIT:~~** ~~Thank you guys so much for all the input! It seems like most of you suggest going for an upper/lower split. I think that's a pretty good idea and will give it a try.~~

**EDIT 2:** You guys are so helpful, thanks. Really appreciate the constructive feedback and also the concerns some of you expressed.

**Taking the top comment into consideration, how about this schedule:**

* **A:** pushups + dips + squats + ab wheel
* **B:** chin-ups + rows + nordic curls + back extensions

My 1rm is at 45% BW. I switch up programs or grips every 2-3 months, eat decently and get 7++ hours of sleep daily. Some programs I have tried are: greasing the groove, russian fighter, basic 5x5, and step loading. I am thinking of ultra low rep (1-3) pull ups and negatives. Currently doing step loading from 3x3s up to 5x5s, where I ramp up the weight used. Just started adding deload weeks once a month and bodyweight rows as supplementary exercise. I train each part (legs, push, pull) twice a week each with a day off in between","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I’m a 27-year-old female who weigh 110 lbs and stand 5’4. My main goal is to grow my glutes and become toned. I’m very new to exercising but I would like to build a home gym in my 1-bedroom apartment. 

I was considering to fit a Synergee Power Rack (Cage) With Pully System in my bedroom. It includes: J Cups, Safety Arms, a Pull Up Bar, Landmine & T Bar Attachment, a Barbell Holder, Dip Station Attachment, a Pulley Station with a 39” Lat Bar and 14” Straight Bar and Foot Board. 

For someone who would mostly concentrate on lower body exercises, is a rack/cage, bench, barbell and weights unnecessary. I don’t have a large apartment but I can fit this rack.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I see a lot of posts here talking about workouts.  My belief is that  workouts should really be your own, so you need to understand your body and work towards your goals.

 I workout on rings  roughly 4 times a week, aside from a complicated shoulder dislocation about 6 months ago, i  have done this for about 2 years. 

My workouts are flexible, paying attention to how my body feels to avoid injury and also keeping my goals in my mind. My goals are never on body appearance, but focus on calisthenics skills.

For these reasons I have a fluid workout program, which has the added important benefit of preventing boredom from repeating the same exercises over and over again. 

This workout  https://youtu.be/7SD041rb8Jg
 travels through foundational exercises such as the back lever, pelican curls and muscle up variations as we learn and condition towards the backwards roll or felge.  

The static exercises of the back lever and front lever straddle are advanced to a dynamic transition and the muscle up is upgraded to a forward felge or rolling muscle up.  

i find it fun and challenging, maybe it can give you some ideas for your routines

"I have been training calisthenics for this past year, with a few month long breaks because of other activities taking priority. I have done the recommended routine for a while, but I'm looking to change it up because I'm focusing mostly on hypertrophy and reps now. I was wondering if this push pull legs routine would likely be effective for hypertrophy.

Push:

Ring push ups 

Overhead press

Dips

Tricep extensions

Pull:

Pull ups

Archer rows

Chin ups

Bicep curls

Legs:

Pistol squat progression

Walking lunges

Nordic hamstring curls

In order to increase my endurance as well, I was thinking of making the second half of the week focused on slightly easier progressions and higher reps, an idea I got from the Red Delta Project. Let me know how I should change my potential routine. Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi, (14M, ~167cm, 56kg here) everyone
I will get straight to the point:
So, I would like to gain muscle quickly under a month, preferably around 20 pounds or more. 

I am not entirely sure if that's doable especially with bodyweight training. The only thing I have is a resistance band at home that I use for legs and biceps. Another thing you might want to know is about my diet. No, I do not have a planned diet from Dietarize or any other place. But I tend to eat Indian food. Please don't confuse it with fast foods! You might think what I eat is very oily and unhealthy but we use olive oil and not so much. I generally think it is healthy.
I also do not eat junk/fast food very often and when I do it is rarely.

So, back to the point: Is it possible for me to gain _20 lbs or more_ of muscle under a month, with bodyweight and a resistance band? (How can I do so?) And can puberty possibly speed up the process (I have heard you have increased testosterone in puberty and it is basically kinda like you are on steroids.)?

Something you might want to know: I have been training since February and I have seen major improvements to my physique as well as my strength plus mobility. So, I believe I already got my newbie gains...??

Sorry if this is a bad question but I would just like to gain weight quickly in the winter break as I do not want to be skinny-muscle, if you know what I mean.

Thanks a lot and please feel free to ask any question!
Edit: Also please correct me anywhere if I am wrong!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello everyone, Im a 17 year old, 178cm (5 10') dude who started training 9 months ago (on rings) and ive definitely made progress since, however for my height, im almost obese weight wise- ideal weight to height is 75 kg at highest , and im 90 Kg atm (Obese is over 91.5)

I dont think im a novice anymore strength wise- max pushups and pullups are 52 and 8 (i could barely do 15 pushups and i couldnt even hang from the rings when i began lol), and cardio wise i dont think there's any problem either

Physique wise too i can definitely see muscle , and although fat is  there i dont think its too bad (most people guess my weight to be 15ish kg lower, and i look normal in shirts), id self assess at 21ish body fat %

Should i be looking to lose weight or will it be ok to maintain what i have now? I feel fine but im a little worried about the weight as it does seem that 90 is too much

Thanks for reading and answering!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello, I took some advice from my previous post about being stuck with ring pull-ups.

I used to go to failure for each set, now I do one day with my old failure mindset for hyperthrophy and one day for overall strength.

As far as I understood, it's ill advised to go to failure while doing strength training, but I feel like I can't push myself enough when I stop before failure.

I can get 4 reps with good form using 22lbs of added weight. I can pull that off for 4 sets. However, I don't feel like my muscles are fatigued. Am I supposed to feel this way?

Pushing for the 5th rep breaks my form, still not failure (maybe 2-3 more with half decent form in the tank). Should I crank that 5th rep? Thank you.

Edit: For reference, the ""good form"" is chest to bar (although bar doesn't exist in the current context since I use rings) while the ""half-decent"" form is slightly below that with a bit momentum involved.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"**30(M), 5'8""**

This is a candid photo my friend clicked while I was talking with others after lunch: https://imgur.com/6O28gWN

I know my posture is fucked up. I face a myriad of issues. Starting from mild indigestion, easily getting tired after doing a few chores, searching for chairs in parties, etc. All these happened due to free internet and a large monitor which I purchased. Spending almost the entire day in front of the desk hunched over. 

I have noticed another thing with my lower body. When I sit in a chair, my legs tend to go outwards. Like keeping them straight takes real effort. I believe it is some form of manspreading. Is it because my inner leg muscles are weak too? Or are my leg muscles overworked because of my frail upper body, they have to bear the entire load?

How to fix this and be strong and fit? Like a normal moving human being. Is the RR sufficient or do I need to focus on something special? Mental barrier to starting something new is also a thing after having spent a sedentary lifestyle for so long (almost 5 to 6 years). 

Assessing from the photo can anyone identify what the problems are? Like which portion/muscle is tight, weak or whatever? I just want to know. How did it come to this? I am really shaken by this photo. 

Any of your critical analyses and suggestions are welcome. Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello im just crating this post to inquire wisdom with simple things like calisthenics, dumbells and pasta.  I'm in a situation where I cant go to the gym. I feel like I should be able  to maintain calisthenics discipline like cardio (running), pushups, pull-ups, body squats, hanging knee raises for abs and obliques.

I have 15 lb dumbell that i would like to build shoulder strength with ex.  Dumbbell Shoulder Press,  Side Lateral Raise, Standing Front Barbell Raise (Overhead). ofcourse biceps.

Any other recommendations or advice? I have many questions regarding single weight dumbbells. Since I am not overloading then increase in reps is inevitable continued by sets. Let's say I get to 6x20 overhead presses and bicep curls, will i be able to maintain that twice a week coupled with pushups, pullups. cardio.

"Anyone here train these often or at all? I've been trying to build up to multiple 5 rep sets but it's been tough. My goal is to push for 8 rep sets in the hopes of building more triceps mass off them. 

So far my template for this has been starting with a wider hand base and moving about 3"" closer every time i hit my target rep/set range. I recently got 3 sets of 6 at 6"" apart. Moved to 3"" apart and got some 4s in. However the jump to touching was harder than expected so I'll probably go back to 6"" apart to hit 8 reps/set and then back to 3"" again to try the same. 

Does anyone have any other tips that have worked for them?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello,

Happy New Year, Best wishes to all !!

I recently got my first gym rings, but I've been uncomfortable using them because of the width of the strap cable. I spend most time being concerned about the cables breaking then working out,
but this is more a confidence issue then a defective product.  

It comes with the regular sized stability strap (around 1 inch wide), so I guess if the rings comes with them, they should be reliable enough for a beginner around 200lb.

I have a pair of ratchet strap 2 inch wide, which is obviously more heavy duty, but will it work if I use them instead?

I know it's a more ""it's in your head"" concern, but will the width of the cable affect the ring in any negative ways?

"Hi Hi, 

I am looking for advice on genuine prison workout as I am currently incarcerated. 

- I have time limited access to workout space, maybe 2 hours per day. No pullup bar, but a small concrete step is available. 

- I have limited space for cardio activities (maybe 20m x 50m).

- No mat available and the ground is raw concrete. 

Note: It is Difficult to plan a schedule as i do not have access to these spaces when it rains

Additional Equipment i can access (i realise it is not exactly in the spirit of bodyweightfitness, but I thought I would include it. 
2 concrete weights around 7kg
1 concrete barbell around 20kg

I dont have much choice in this

- Rice 3x a day
- Some vegetables
- Limited meat
- Limited eggs
- Sweet breads on request
- (I could request some additional food or supplements if recommended) 

I fast from sunrise to sunset every Monday and Thursday



Goals:

- Practical strength
- Improve lower back strength and mobility (old climbing injury) 
- Maintain condition for rock climbing
- Avoid becoming fat
- improvement in taekwondo training
- Emotional and psychological wellbeing

"To keep it simple, I have a fitness exam coming up for the first time in a long time. In that time I seriously let my body go by putting on 30 pounds (I’m a 6’2” male early 20s, peaked at 215 lbs) and allowed the muscles I need to deteriorate significantly. As of a couple months ago I was placed on a medication that as a side effect  curbs appetite and I’ve been capitalizing on it by fasting a day or two at a time and cutting down portions when I do eat. So far I’ve lost 20 pounds and have noticed significant fat loss. 

My exam is in a month and a half and I’m not where I want to be. I can pass but that just simply isn’t going to be enough for me, I’ve set a goal I want to reach and I need to know if it’s possible to reliably build up the muscles required for the test (push-ups, sit-ups, and a run) while simultaneously fasting periodically.

My workout routine consists of a 3 part push-up routine that cycles diamond, standard, and wide push-ups until exhaustion for 3 sets. In between the rotations I’m doing a 2 part sit-up routine where I’m doing half sit-ups on the lower half to failure, then the second part is the upper half of a sit-up to failure. I follow this routine every other day and run on the days in between. I’ve been seeing progress but it just simply isn’t enough. If I have to focus on either maximum muscle growth or maximum weight loss, which would yield better results?

I know very little of nutritional health as I’ve always been the lanky kid who could eat everything and stay thin but it’s caught up to me these last couple years. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I recently started with calisthenics, and in September I wanted to try the handstand. I had some prior fitness from the 10 year in the gym, so I think it helped my progress a lot. Now I can do a 1 minute handstand (no wall) without any problem. I am now training for the OAHS but it's hard to keep the balance.

However I also tried the handstand on only my fingertips for support. Obviously it was hard as I only managed it for 5 sec, but my question is; would it be beneficial for other exercises to keep doing the handstand on only my fingertips? Or is the risk for injury to high? I can not find so much info on the internet about that.

"So I've been trying various programs for going on two years now, and after thinking about it for a year and reading Overcoming gravity 2ed I've now given designing my own a whirl. Been trying it out this week and am now pretty pleased with it, so thought I'd check in for some feedback.

It's in triplets, with 3min rest starting after the first exercise is completed, so it's 3 min rest between each set of pullups. I first tried pairs, but that was a bit too much downtime so the workout took a while. The goal is a full body session so I'm doing this 3 times per week and considering adding 1 cardio and some light yoga and stretching on top later.

I do 3 sets of each exercise, with the goal of doing at least 3 reps, but if I manage 8 I upgrade that variant to a heavier. When I'e got this setup down I'm thinking of adding a mesocycle around it with 2 week strength, 2week hypertrohpy where it's 10-16 rep range and slightly shorter rest, and 1 week deload. It's pretty fun to think about this things, I'm quite new to the theory of this :)

Hi guys,

I need some advice regarding starting with calisthenics, running and HIIT. I hope you can help me.

I am 38 male, 181 cm and 75 kg. I run 4 - 5 times a week. Doing my long slow run on Sunday morning. 

On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I do a 20 a 30 minutes stretching after waking up.

I am not healthy! I live healthy, but sadly I have to take daily medication to stay alive. I started with my medication 5 years ago and it fucked up my muscles regarding to training them. Using my muscles for power/weight training became extremely intense. I have lost lots of stamina and power. Whereas I could easily train to 30 push ups before medication, I am not happy to get to 12 push ups.

But no worries, it is what it is. I am happy to do my running. Nevertheless for the last couple of months I am inspired start again with calisthenics. 

I am planning to cut down my running and only do a 3 mile run before starting with calisthenics. I prefer running after, but somehow my legs are done after a workout. Not before. I am also planning to continue with my stretching. 

Now I found a calisthenics beginner program [online](https://www.drworkout.fitness/calisthenics-workout-plan-for-beginners/) and I am wondering if it is a good one? I want to add lunges during the workouts.

I also want to add a 10 - 15 min HIIT session. But I don’t know if that’s a good idea? If so, when is it best to incorporate it?

Thank you for your time and help!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey fellas I’m looking for some information from the Reddit community to help me with my goal!

"Here to share some workout tips! It is quite common to see straight sets (just like straight people 😂). It goes something like this:

🌟 Push Ups for 5 sets of 5 reps (or 5 x 5). This means you do the 1st set, rest, then 2nd set, rest, then 3rd set...etc.

While this is 'straight' forward (ok I'll stop with the pun), it actually takes A LOT of time! Not to mention you'll need to rest MORE as you fatigue the SAME group of muscles! Then imagine repeating that process for 4-5 exercises! 🤯

A better way would be to do Antagonistic Pairs, which means pairing 2 exercises that uses opposing movement patterns and emphasises opposing muscle groups.

🌟 For the upper body, this means pairing a PULL movement with a PUSH movement.  
🌟 For the lower body, this means pairing a SQUAT movement with a HINGE movement.

A sample workout could be:

🅰️1️⃣ Assisted One Arm Chin Up - 2 sets x 3 reps, rest 3 mins  
🅰️2️⃣ Planche Push Up - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins

🅱️1️⃣ Weighted Pistol Squat - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins  
🅱️2️⃣ Nordic Hamstring Curl - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins

(This means you do A1 for set 1, rest, then A2 for set 1, rest, back to A1 for set 2, rest...etc.)

This method MINIMIZES overall workout time, while MAXIMIZING rest times for individual exercises, which means you can keep the intensity high! 🥳

Trying applying this to your next workout! And comment below for questions and inquiries!

P. S. Not here to say that straight sets don't work, but they just take up too much time. I also generally advise full body or upper/lower splits over push/pull/legs, which works better for the general population in terms of rest and recovery (in my opinion, of course).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I was talking to my brother about how I can do 12 pull-ups in a row with good form and he was telling me it doesn’t count since I have to go down to a hang then back up.

I google it up and these are the definitions for both of them, pull-up/ “an exercise involving raising oneself with one's arms by pulling up against a horizontal bar fixed above one's head.” Full range pull-up/ “When you do pull ups you should always aim for a full range of motion. Do not only use the upper or lower part of the movement and go into full extension of your arms at the bottom but on the contrary you keep your shoulderblades pulled down.”","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

For example, if I do push-ups to failure I literally cannot do the movement from pure muscle fatigue. My muscles just will not do the work and it's impossible to lift myself up, but not from a sensation of pain or burning. My muscles just will not do it.

But when I do ab exercises, I have to stop just from the sheer burning sensation, but seems like if I'd be able to push through that pain I'd be able to continue for longer. I also feel like I can't breathe well and have to take conscious deep breaths after I stop to relieve the pain in my abs before I can continue again.

Why is there such a big difference here in the experience of muscle fatigue, and is what I'm experiencing normal? Is it safe to try to try mental conditioning to push through that pain to try to prolong the exercise?

Edit: I'm not sure why this has been upvoted so much or why I am receiving awards, but thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So my city just went back into lockdown for at least a month so back to the home gym.

I have a dumbell that goes up to 50lbs, backpack, and a doorway pull up bar that I also use as paralettes. I wanted to include weighted pushups using my dumbell and my backpack but after trying them out in my workout, the dumbell moves around when I get into the pushup position and I'm just worried it'll cause imbalances or injuries?

Especially cause I'm doing them with ""paralettes"" so more rom idk maybe I'm overthinking it but when the dumbell shifts a tiny bit during my pushup i feel like I'm doing it wrong.

Am I? Or is weight on top of my body the same no matter what? Sorry I was never the brightest thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I have been into calisthenics for a year and i want to start using weight. I researched a bit and the best (and cheapest) one I saw was the gravity weighted vest.

" Do I really have to do dynamic stretches as a way of warming up? This way of warming up is really an ordeal for me, I find it really boring and it genuinely demotivates me to train. Also, I tend to exaggerate a lot, either by sometimes spending a good 20 minutes doing stuff like cobras, cat-camels, wrist warm ups etc, or by completely neglecting warming up and jumping straight into the work-out (I have no clue when it’s too much or too little, but the latter has given me injuries in the past). My work-out consists of pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, push-ups (3 variations: normal grip, wide grip, diamond), and some accessories: bicep curls and neck curls, most of the time ring-assisted.

I would rather do the basic version of each exercise: scapular pull-ups and dead leg hangs for pull-ups/chin-ups, wall push-ups/incline push-ups for... well, push-ups, stationary dips for dips… You got it. This would allow me to jump straight into the workout, without the monotonous (and often laughable) stretch based warm-ups. But I’m not sure how easy this will be on my joints/muscles, since I’m aiming for PRs basically every session, and I’m training 6 times a week (good sleep/diet assured). Most of my exercises are still bodyweight based (I’m aiming for explosiveness and high reps), but sometimes I’d train with a weighted vest. Perfomance-wise I'd say I'm intermediate.

TL;DR I hate dynamic stretches and would rather warm-up by doing easier variations of basic exercises. Would this make me more prone to injury?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Like many people, I've started a workout routine this year. I've taken one big lesson to heart: **The best fitness routine is the one you actually do.** So I've realized that I can do a five minute warmup workout first thing in the morning, and a 10-15 minute workout after work, and I've been sticking to it 5 days a week so far. It fits my schedule, I haven't burned myself out trying to do more than I can do.

My issue is rest and recovery. I'm trying to do strength workouts one day, alternate cardio the next. I don't like running, and it's too cold to jump rope, so I'm doing burpees and mountain climbers and such. But, since I'm not lifting weights, it's like I'm doing the same exercises every day.

Yes, I'm overthinking it. Yes, I know I'm talking about a 10 minute workout, not training like The Rock. Building good habits is more important right now than the minutiae of hypertrophy and triglycerides.

Basically, I want to know if I'm overtraining myself doing HIIT workouts that work the whole body, with one day focusing on building strength and the next focusing on speed.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"To preface, I am not a bodyweight athlete. I am currently running Sheiko's powerlifting program, but outside of weights I am a rock climber. That being said, I find my pulling strength to be far weaker than my push strength when it comes to bodyweight. When fresh I can usually get a set of 5 pullups in with reps decreasing on the following sets. 

Does anyone have any specific routines I could follow at this level to increase reps? I find gtg to be a bit too unstructured for myself, and perhaps not even beneficial at the rep range I am at. I'd like to get comfortable enough with pullups to be able to start working towards a muscle up.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Now I’ve graduated but good a new position at work and I’m completely full time now and sometimes I’ll work overtime. By time I’m out the gym will be absolutely packed and what should be an hour and half workout turns into 3 hours, plus COVID safety and whatnot. So I think it’s time I get out the gym and start doing some body weight exercising. I have a theater room in my garage. Screen and speakers are on side of the room and the couch on the opposite, with a good amount of space to do some damage in between. 

I want to do mostly body weight exercises, but I’m open to buying these things. Adjustable dumbbells, pull up bar, bands, and I guess that’s it? Maybe some plates since I asume most workouts will have core exercises that require weights. 

With all that said, what workout do you recommend for me? Assume I’m a couch potato whose spent his life playing Dark Souls all day, everyday and is it really bad shape and is getting close to a dad bod…","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Just feeling elated as I've now almost completed one year of my bodyweight fitness journey and would like to share my progress with you guys..

Used to weight 62kgs at 17.3% bodyfat, 28.9kg muscle mass at the start of this year...
Now I'm at 63kgs with 8.5% bodyfat and 31.8 kg muscle mass.. (Body recomposition...)
Height: 5'7""

Skills Unlocked:

Pistol squats,
L-Sit Holds on parallets ,
Advanced tuck planche hold on parallets ,
Front lever raises, (can hold for 2 sec.. so not sure if that counts..)
Superman pushups, (Was able to do clap pushups earlier..)
Toe touch pushups,
Behind clap pushups,


Progressive overload:
+20kg weighted pull-ups (5-6 reps),
Was able to bench 60kgs, although I don't do bench press generally,
Was able to squat 70kgs,
One arm pushup form improved a lot...


Planning to continue this journey forward and hopefully planning to unlock planche, muscle ups in 2022...
I suck at the transition phase.. so focusing on tiger bent pushups and trying to unlock russian dips...


Routine was more intuition based (Got calimove course but didn't follow that...)
Was following a push pull leg split...

However I am quite unhappy with my mobility in certain areas especially in my lower body. I started off with passive stretching already couple years ago in the gym but never took it serious. Until now I know that passive strechting alone will not do the job, i looked into different videos of tom merrick, fitnessfaqs, strength side, saturno movement, ... and also tried strengthening counter-part muscles of the ones i stretch as well as focusing on my breathing more. 

Still I feel I am getting no where.. I can touch my toes and do basic stuff but I was able to do that before.. I aiming to a decent V-Sit and some kind of a pancake as well as pistols without the need to higher my ankes.

I guess its a lack of discipline in first place as I dont do stretching daily and consistently enough. But I also think doing some random YT videos over and over again wont get my anywhere longtime neither (alltough some of them are usefull for sure).

I think I need a program that I can do on a daily basis (or at least 4-5 times a week) without thinking about it and looked into https://www.calimove.com/p/mobility and https://www.strongundflex.de/einfach-beweglich.

Hello all! My name is Jack and I am currently studying Psychology at University. Within my degree, I have chosen to research gym users' self-perception.

For my Psychology dissertation, I have decided to research the effects of extended gym use on self-perceived body image, satisfaction, and motivation. 

I believe that there is a period of time where motivation becomes lower and gym users will notice slower progression resulting in lower self-perceived body satisfaction. This may be involving levels of dopamine not reaching the same levels they used to reach after a gym session.

The questionnaire provided will be completely anonymous - the only personal data collected would be an age range and a range of time that you have attended a gym.

I am recruiting participants who are interested in this topic who have had any gym experience in their lifetime, past or present who are at least 18 years old. Due to the nature of the questionnaire, it is advised not to take part in this study if you have any known body image, or related, disorders. The questionnaire itself will take up to 10 minutes.

Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding more information if necessary otherwise please use the provided link to continue with the study. 

Thank you for your time, it is so appreciated :)

"Hi,

New to this, but I can manage maybe three push ups, before my left arm just gives. I specifically feel as if there is too much weight on my elbow and the muscle at the rear up my arm (shoulder->elbow) just isn't there. The other side feels strong. I'm not sure why but I think the following is an issue.

I have poor shoulder mobility, mainly from pinched nerve in my neck from bad posture. For example my right arm can stretch up vertically, while the left gets about 75% the way there, also turning my neck to the left, it just stops at a certain point.

Just joined this community, and started the RR a couple of weeks ago!

This is a total beginner question, but I haven't had any luck in seeing it answered. 

I know that if you weigh more, calisthenics is tougher, especially the deeper you go, and your progress will be slower. While I'm totally fine with that - woudn't me being a heavier weight be..helpful? Now I know that's a dumb question but I'm not sure why that isn't the case.

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/muscle-pain-it-may-actually-be-your-fascia

Cited a reference for the source and my solution is stretching in addition to your exercise routine.

Here's the routine

1. Do your breath work, for me that's 8 breathes of wimhof.

2. Isometric warm up the muscle area. Like do static squats or push up or chin up.  (Ive always done stretching after exercise as cool down)

3. Then do the stretch and hold it for atleast 20 seconds.  You can work you way by progression by adding seconds to hold x position till 1-2 minutes.

Question can you stretch everyday?

Yes.  Just make sure to warm up the muscle. So you don't injure yourself.

Is bouncing ok?

No.  Because if you're not yet flexible, doing so may lessen your flexibility or injure yourself.

Is dynamic stretching ok?

Yes. But it's not what I promote because if you're new to stretching, you may hurt yourself.

Sample routine I do.

1. Wake up
2. Do the day's exercise (deload or workout)
3. Wimhof breaths 8 reps per stretch.
4. Cold shower
5. Breakfast work etc.

https://www.healthline.com/health/full-body-stretch

Reference for basic routine

Tldr.  Stretch after your work out.  You can stretch everyday.  Stretching is good for you.

Progression

Breathwork>walking>isometrics and stretching>full range of motion and stretching.

"I've been trying to figure out for the longest time how to deal with my muscle imbalances from soccer. For reference I kick with my right leg. I've noticed that in terms of balance  (think single leg squats) my left leg is stronger since I used it to plant before kicking, whereas I'm still wobbly on my right leg (knee tends to cave in so I have to focus more).

As for glute definition from the side (think mirror side view ""p"") my right glute is more lifted and bigger than the left (I guess you could say the left side looks like the before and the right looks like the after). This makes sense since I was kicking back so much on my right side so it feels like my left glute is either inactive or the muscle isn't as developed.

Whats a good way to correct this issue. Also if you've struggled with the same issue before, how long did it take before you were able to correct the issue and how often did you perform your exercises?

"Can I train for strength on vertical pull while focusing more on hypertrophy for everything else? Visually/physically, I don't think I have muscle size imbalances, but strength-wise I have a huge vertical pull imbalance because for a big period of time I only trained horizontal pull (and push and legs of course). For the record, I can do about 3 sets of 7 pseudo-planche pushups but I can only do 2 chinups and I can't do one full ROM pull-up. 

So I was thinking of training in the 5-15 range for all the other movements (horizontal pull, the push movements and the legs) and training below 5 for the vertical pull. Is this okay? My progressions in my routine are pretty much the same as the RR's for the most part and actually the whole routine is almost identical. If I train for lower reps should I do more sets instead (more than 3 sets of vertical pull per workout) while still doing 3 sets of the other progressions?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916995/)



Very interesting. I've always known (and perhaps everyone here) that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. What got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pull-ups. I was under the (wrong) impression that the external rotation from the chin-up created more space in the shoulder complex, thereby reducing the chances of shoulder impingement. I was wrong. Regular pull ups might be the way to go for anyone with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. How about neutral grip pull ups?

**TLDR:**  *High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk.*","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"As a lot of us have no doubt seen there was a big drive on bracing inwards or exhaling completely whilst ab training to avoid ‘bread loaf abs’.

Personally I’ve found that if I spend a good amount of time fully expanding my belly or bracing outwards I actually have this great core activation, especially the obliques. 

I get why you need to exhale to get a great flexion and crunch of the rectus abdominis but could some of us need to train our abs in more of an extended position?

Exhale, flexion and crunch definitely trains the abs. 

But could an inhale and brace train the abs in a more functional way, especially for those with poor posture. 

Anecdotally, dedicated ab workouts with more flexion based exercises and that cinched aesthetic after makes me feel a lot less stable than bracing and non cinched ab workouts. 

Feel like I subconsciously tighten my stomach in everyday life which restricts my breathing. 

Spending half hour focusing on expansion and tensing my abs definitely helps my posture.

Those that subconsciously hold in their stomach are likely compensating for a weak overall core, IE weak glutes or hamstrings at the base of the core. Lower abs and stomach tightens inwards to compensate restricts the diaphragm from moving optimally therefore this laboured shallow and rapid chest breathing that many of us have.

Keen to hear peoples thoughts?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I’m a 20 year old guy who got tired of looking skinny and committed to working out 3/4 times a week. My next step is committing to a proper diet. I tell myself I eat enough but I know that’s a lie so I want to change that. 

I’m 185 cm and currently weigh about 74 Kg. My ideal weight is 80 Kg and I want to put on 0.5 kg per week. An online calculator recommended I should eat around 3800-4000 calories. How am I supposed to reach this mark without eating unhealthy food or spending my days in the kitchen? 

I have lunch at work which is always unpredictable and the portion is very limited. So I’m even considering cooking something extra in the morning to bring in to work. 

If anyone out there has a meal plan or suggestions on what I should eat I would really appreciate it!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello,

I am doing the recommended routines for 3 days. I've been doing it for 3 months now. I can see the progress (eg. 0 pull up to 3 pullups) but I am still a beginner. 

I would like to do a skill day on my rest day. I think I should focus on one skill at a time. (I have looked at the skill day page. It has L-sit and handstand) What would you guys suggest? Should I focus on one skill at a time or multiple related skills? 

I am planning to start with L-sit. I am looking for a list of skills that I can target. 

I saw this list below in one of the youtube videos.  

__Edited__ I got this list from a youtube video ""Abnormal_Beings's How to Start Calisthenics - Calisthenics Skills Guide on what to Learn First"". I think it's similar to this answer. https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-beginners-to-advanced-skills-that-should-be-learned-in-calisthenics/answer/Mustafa-Rakhmet

What do you guys think about this list? Should I train them in that order? 

**Novice**

  1. L-sit
  2. Muscle up
  3. Pull over
  4. Skin the cat
  5. Frogstand
  6. Planche lean
  7. Elbow Level
  8. Headstand (Correction: Not handstand)

**Intermediate**

  1. handstand
  2. Dragon flag
  3. Human Flag
  4. handstand push up
  5. Tucked rows
  6. tucked planche
  7. back level
  8. front lever
  9. one-arm push up
  10. V-sit

**Advanced**

  1. straight arm handstand presses
  2. Straddle planche
  3. one arm pull up
  4. 90 degree handstand push up
  5. front lever pull up
  6. full planche
  7. Maltese
  8. Iron cross

Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Yesterday I got my first [good form human flag](https://www.instagram.com/p/CValH33jOTx/?utm_medium=copy_link) without any specific training! I’ve done maybe 5 flag attempts in the past year, my first of which I couldn’t even hold the flag support position. I’m amazed that you can unlock what I considered a pretty advanced skill just through unspecific strength training.


Training heavy weighted pull ups and handstand push ups seem to excellent crossover for this skill. The best I’ve got on the other side is a wobbly straddle flag, so still work to be done!


Next on the list is a human flag push up","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

• Rings Pullups to Chin-up grip 4×8-12

• Close grip Pullups 4×6-8

• Half L-Sit alternative grip Pull-up 4×8 (2 sets for each grip)

• Rows 4×12

• Pelican Curls eccentric 3×6-8

Questions I have
1: Is rest enough? Because I have heard that from Austin Dunham and others is that for building muscle 1-2 min rest with 8-12 (6-15 even) reps are required with 3-5 sets. The problem with 1-2 min rest is that I can't do all the reps after the 1st set.

"Hi 16(m), so a quick backstory; started calisthenics during covid(qaurintine) with a basic workout routine and eventually built up my strength from not being able to a single pull up to doing 3x7 in 2-3 months. took a break over the summer. Got back into it on once skl started on and off for abt 4-6 months (was mainly into weighted calisthenics and eventually built up the strength to do 4 pull-ups with 25 pounds on me, and also achieved a 15-25 second L sit . Now we are here around 7 months later when I just got back into it. I’ve been doing this routine for the last month and seen pretty good progress so far.

Workout routine:
Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday

Superset 1: (1:30 rest inbetween sets)
Pullups 4x failure
Dips 4x failure 

Superset 2: (1:30 in between sets)
Pushups 4x failure
Rows 4x failure

Hanging L sit progression 3x failure


Monday, Wednesday
Pullups 1x failure
Dips 1x failure
Pushups 1x failure 
Rows 1x failure
Hanging L sit progression 3x failure
Chin ups 3x failure 
Wall assisted handstand practice- 5 minutes practicing

Friday and Saturday 
Rest days

Wanna build up to have enough strength to do 3x20-25 of most excersizes and then move onto weighted calisthenics 

Lmk what u think, thank you!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey there,

I’ve been quite new to calisthenics. Originally I am coming from regular body building. I’ve always combined normal body building with a few calisthenics movements. So I would say I have a solid base when it comes to basic skills and especially strength. 
My goal is building more strength and endurance as well as a good muscle growth. 
Here is the routine I designed so far:

Push A:
10 diamond push ups 
Rest 10 secs
30 air squats
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

8 parallel bar dips
Rest 10 secs
30 secs burpees
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

30 sec plank
Rest 30 sec 
10 leg raises 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times


Pull A:
8 pull ups 
Rest 10 secs
20 air squats 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

12 Australian rows
Rest 10 secs
1 min box step ups 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

30 sec dragon fly hold 
Rest 30 secs
10 knee side raises hanging 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Push B:
12 pike push ups on parallets 
Rest 10 secs
10 deadlifts
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

8 archer push ups
rest 10 secs
8 straight bar dips
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

12 crunches 
Rest 30 secs
30 sec plank
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Pull B:
12 chin ups
Rest 10 secs
20 air squats 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

6 wide grip pull ups
Rest 10 secs
10 burpees
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

20 sec L-sit hold hanging
Rest 30 secs
15 crunches 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Before every workout I do a solid warm up for my muscles and joints. Other than that I do some skill work for handstands before the push workouts. Additionally I go for 2-3 runs a week. 
Since I am new to making my own calisthenics workout routine I am a bit unsure if this routine is solid for making progress. 
What’s your opinion?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I was amused and inspired by this [tiktok series](https://www.tiktok.com/@xpmovement/video/6992329742472989958) of doing bear-crawl for an extra minute per day for 30 days. So 1 minute on day 1, through 30 minutes on day 30. The later videos, like [day 90](https://www.tiktok.com/@xpmovement/video/7026816160830082350) (after 30 he kept it at 30 minutes but gradually expanded to more movements) are more impressive, though clearly this guy was already in pretty great shape before starting this routine in the first place. Kind of gimmicky, and not exactly a well \*rounded\* workout, but seems like a decent gateway to just starting doing something without overthinking a routine too much.

FWIW it got this on-again-off-again BWF-er to start up again. I've been doing it every day, though taking a break every few minutes as-needed, and only adding a minute when I feel up to it. After about 2.5 weeks I'm up to 9 minutes and starting to haphazardly throw in some other exercises throughout the day - mainly pullups and one legged squats. Maybe I'll eventually get back into the full-blown RR again, but for now I'm enjoying a less goal-oriented and more playful approach

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the great suggestions for other movement and play oriented routines! I look forward to checking them out!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Does anyone else seem to fall in the middle category of able to do at least 10 pull ups yet unable to maintain that number of reps for several sets? I understand that 10 is just too close to my current max, and thus such a high intensity with close to 0 reps left in the tank will naturally lead to being able to do less reps on the next set but it seems so difficult to get to consistent sets of 10+. I know people recommend weighted training to increase reps, and that is one option I have been trying. Ideally, I get to the point where cranking out 10 good pull ups exerts a similar amount of exhaustion as performing 20  pushups - not really anywhere near failure, but a large pump from all the volume. Pull up pros who have been in my shoes, how did y'all get from where I am to where I want to be? Appreciate all discussion and opinion.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi,

So just some info on me to begin with. 175cm ~70kg and 22M. Been training with the rr for almost a year now. Went from 0 pullups to 12 solid reps on rings and from 12 really poor pushups to 20 pushups with solid form. I'm looking to start training with adding weight to these movements. But seeing as I have no experience with traditional strength training I'm not really sure how to program this.

I was thinking of doing a ppl split so that on each upper day I can focus all my energy into the weighted movement + some accessories. I was thinking something like this for the workouts.

Push: Weighted pushups, db ohp, some tricep isolation and additional shoulder work. (Lu raises and external rotation exercises)

Pull: Weighted pullups. Ring face pulls, ring rows, bicep curls, some forearm isolation too. Probably reverse wrist curls and finger curls.

With programming for the accessories, I have an idea of what to do. It's the weighted movements I'm unsure of. I plan on starting with 5kgs on each movement and seeing how it feels. But beyond that I'm not sure, other than my goal is building strength. Any advice would be appreciated!!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I don’t have access to a gym currently, and I need some good at-home exercises to help tone my chest! I have decent endurance so I just need something that’s efficient and possible in my situation! Bonus if it doesn’t require any equipment at all!

Currently I’m just doing several sets of traditional push-ups and diamond push-ups, but I can’t help but think that there are much better exercises for the chest that I’m just not aware of.

I’ve never been a gym person, so I’ve always just exercised by running, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the sort of old school “gym class” stuff. It’s kept me very fit but I definitely want to tone my body more!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I have been training to achieve a muscle up, I have not yet achieved it and thought perhaps I could ask some guidance?

This is what my workout typically looks like:

Day 1:
Max pull ups - I started by trying to get 20 in as few sets as possible but once I reached 10 I increased this to 30 - max 11 consecutively
Max straight bar dips - same as above - max 10
30 minute run
L-sit progressions - 3 sets of Tuck L-sit holds with the aim of 30+ seconds each set, my best set was 31s, 22s, 14s
Touchdown squats - building up to pistol squats but not my focus just yet.

With the research I have conducted I realise a couple of points which I have not incorporated because I just don’t know how to properly.

1. I would be better off to focus on more explosive pull ups for fewer reps - would it be effective for me to work plyometric pull ups so I know it is explosive?
2. The muscle up pattern/technique curves around the bar and is not just a straight pull

Whenever I have tried to swing forward I attempt to pull upon the backward swing but I don’t seem to be able to pull in enough and it just becomes a sloppy looking pull up - I am thinking that if I add headbangers in I might get past this issue.

I am considering training more towards the one arm pull up. I know it is a movement which demands more strength to perform but I figure that if I can build up the strength necessary for that I would by effect enable me to learn the muscle up easier.

What would anyone recommend, keep doing what I’m doing, add/remove something, focus on one arm pull ups or alternate between them?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"First of all, I'm aware that you can't spot reduce fat. (e.g. You cannot lose 5kg in your thighs without affecting the rest of your body). You lose weight evenly trough out the whole body. So with knowing that, what would the result of the experiment be? 

For example will pullups get easier because of my chicken legs? Or will they get more difficult because of the missing muscle? And yes, I know that the only real way to lose 5kg off of my legs is through tons of cardio. But I'm ready man! My goal is to just have explosive pull and push power for muscle ups. All kinds of them - standard, reverse grip, clapping, wide, close grip. I'm in love with the movement. Would losing a lot of weight help me explode up on top of the bar, or would it do the exact opposite - make me weak and scrawny? 

My stats: 5'8 / 173cm

59kg / 128lbs

Around 14% bodyfat 

&#x200B;

Example: 5'8 / 173cm

52 kg / 115 lbs 

Around 7-8% bodyfat

Will THESE stats absolutely kill my strength or actually make me a skinny beast that feels light as a feather?

I'm a skinny beginner and I need all advice I can get. My only goal is to basically fly when I pull up the bar. I'd like to be able to do all kinds of muscle ups smoothly!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
Is this normal?! (35 f) in the past year I've lost 60 lbs. I haven't lost any weight in the past 2 months. So recently maybe 3 weeks now I started you tube HIIT and strength and body weight videos every morning . Usually 30 mins long. I haven't been able to keep up with the person doing the video but I give it my all. Have even added some 10 or 15 lb weights in sometimes. So I guess I have 2 questions. Does anyone shake? Like whatever part of the body I'm working out after a few reps I'm shaking. Or am I just that bad out of shape? Lol also did anyone just stop losing weight when they started adding weights into their workout? Before when I started to lose weight I only dieted and walked. When I got up to 4 mile walks I haven't lost any more but haven't gained. Sorry if this post is long. I've only been on here a short time and this is my first post. 🙂,"bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"so i am now transitioning toward training using an emphasis of calisthenics. i ofcourse have already begun to implement basic calisthenic movements such as push ups dips and pull ups in my training but i now want to move onto learning calisthenic skills 

my main goal for 2022 will be to handstand and possibly hold a handstand for 10 seconds.  as of right now i am not even ready to begin training for this. this is purely because i am and have always been a weak individual. and recently (due to medical issues) lost about 15lbs making me weaker than my usual. my joints are unable to take the load and for handstands this ofcourse is my wrists.

i have given myself the first three months of this year where i am not jumping into learning calisthenic skills but rather want to use these months to condition and strengthen my joints and tendons specifically wrists and ankles. i understand tendons and connective tissue take very long to get strong but i just need to get them strong enough to start the most basic progresssions.

i need guidance on how to do this. specific routines i shoudl follow and how many times a week. ifi this was you and you had three months to do this how would you go about it? been looking at potentially just using kinstretch PAILS/RAILS 2-3 times per week. or that GMB wrist routine daily? a bit lost to be honest.

\- working towards a handstand this year. joints to weak to train even basic progressions

\- got 3 months where main focus is conditioning of my wrists and ankles

"Hey everyone,

I (33, male, 60kg at 171) recently started working out again and I'm following the RR. I have worked out in the past and am not a complete beginner. My goal is to gain muscle and finally getting a physique I can be proud of.
So first of all thanks to this community for putting together all that information for people like me. It helps a lot.

I have a specific question regarding the pull up progression. I can do 4-5 regular pull ups on rings with proper form. However, I first began with negatives, since I don't see myself doing 3 sets of 5 regulars. When I do 3 sets of regulars, reps decrease over the sets and I end up with only 2 or 3 in the last set. 
Is that still better than sticking to negatives, or does that mean I'm just not ready for regular pull ups in my routine.
And adding to that, when would I change from negatives to regulars. 
And is there a progression for negatives in itself, since they can be quite differently challenging depending on how long you take to go down.

Many questions, thanks in advance.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am early 40s 6ft 185lbs, training for 6 months now and never squatted really in my life prior to this and its causing major issues. (flat shoes)

&nbsp;



What i have noticed is when going down in the squat my legs feel weak, the depth is never close to A2G, holding the position just feels weak, and absolutely zero explosiveness coming up from the squat.

With any form of squats (including body)  after about four squats it feels that my lower half is weak, almost crumbling, so trying to come back up i have zero explosiveness, like i feel deflated not mentally just physically.

&nbsp;


Now i hack squat about 100lbs which for me the most part is fine, just explosiveness is less but feels better than body or standard squats.

Pendulum squat even with zero weight (which the machine almost puts me A2G) there is no way i can get up, there is no drive, no power at all.

Leg press though is perfectly fine, feels great and fairly heavy for me

I am stumped, any ideas, or suggestions to fix this, to make me look forward to leg day.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hi, 

I recently bought a workout stand which has a place for dips. These are also low enough where I can use them to do inverted rows, though at an angle. I'm wondering if it matters if I do them like this? The focus is on the hands, not their body position.

[Grip A](https://physicalliving.com/img/lebert_equalizer_marc_lebert_bodyweight_row_top_position.jpg) - the one I plan

Thanks. 

While i'm already here, will the angle matter that much? That is, as I can't lay down flat on the ground, I will be at like a 15-20 degree angle from the floor with my legs on the ground.

I'm probably not the only one who does this.  But I bet some time in your life you've had cramps in the soles of your foot, especially if you didn't warm up properly.

I find doing this as a finisher for leg exercises good.  Squishing the stress ball with your foot.

Good for swimming, track and field, or sports where you need to move on your toes much.

Doesn't take much to get to hypertrophy.  Just be sure to have somewhere to sit.

2-3 x a week

You'll see the difference once you've started on it.  Less cramps and you can claw in the floor with your toes more.

Strengthen those toes.

Same applicable with the fingers.

Note:

My feet isn't so pretty.  It has undergone a lot of trauma from kicking so it's a bit callused.

The scar below my big toe was from a bite from someone when I kicked him in competition. >∆< the one near the ankle is a similar bite.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

They’ve got facilities only in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland and Australia, so some of you guys may have not heard of them.

It seems their approach is a bit more scientific and they have machines which are unique to them. Maybe it’s a good introduction into weight training for someone rather new to the whole thing?

Admittedly they focus more on people with ailments it seems, back pain in particular, but do market towards just building general strength also.

"Hi everyone! 

I've been powerlifting for the past 3 years and I'm thinking of making the switch over to calisthenics. I've always found calisthenics to be very interesting, but at the time I started working out I just enjoyed powerlifting a lot more. Fast forward to the covid climate I'm just not willing to risk going to the gym anymore. Also, I would rather have a better looking physique than be big and on the fatter side. I know each discipline isn't exclusive to either, but I believe achieving each is easier depending on one's discipline. 

A few questions:

1. How do you guys think the transition from powerlifting to calisthenics will affect my muscle mass? I started cutting on the 1st of January and have only been doing calisthenics based workouts at home - these mainly consist of push ups, dips, and pull ups. 

2. I'm used to being in the gym for 2 to 3 hours at a time and doing a bodybuilding split after my initial workout of powerlifting. How long should my calisthenics workouts be? 

3. How do you guys plan your workouts? Do you use an app or some online guide? 

4. How does progressive overloading work in calisthenics? 

5. Are there any pieces of equipment that you guys think are a ""must-have"" or would just be very beneficial for my calisthenics workouts?

"Hi, 

I just started bodyweight exercises about 3 and a half weeks ago. I cut down on some extra fat during the summer from running and cardio and lost 20 pounds. Now, I want to bulk up and gain 20 but make sure a good amount of it is muscle. I feel like Im overthinking this, but am I working out enough? I’ve gained 5-6 pounds on a 600 calorie surplus. I do push ups, bicep curls with a 25 pound backpack, pull ups, dips, crunches, and side lateral raises With a backpack. Its a good amount but I feel like I’m gaining more fat than muscle. The workout is for about an hour and I workout about 5 days a week. Any advice, tips, or anything would really be appreciate. Sorry if I sound dumb I’m just  very new","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi

So I have posts here a few types before and I was doing the BWF primer some time back (3-4 months).

I am 5.5 ft tall and around 70KG weight. I have slightly muscular arms. I would like to gain a decent amount of muscle mass and get to atleast low 2 digit body fat (12-15%). I am approx around 20% body fat (AFAIK).

Can someone let me know some kind of detailed plans as to how can I get into the shape of my dreams and achieve my ideal physique. 

I had a look at Cali moves programmes and found them to be quite interesting too. Is it recommend for someone like me?

Also is a year enough time to achieve this?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"My friend wants to start exercising but he cant use his right arm and shoulder. He's a beginner. I'm trying to find optimal exercises for him to do. Can you guys help me find alternatives for the recommended routine? They don't really have to be bodyweight exercises, he has access to a gym (no personal trainer though) but I thought I should ask you since y'all are so creative with the alternatives. Or maybe do any of you know about a routine that he could do with just one arm? So far I have:

First Pair

3x5-8 Overhead Dumbbell Press or Kettlebell Swings

3x5-8 Regular Squat Progression for now

Second Pair

3x5-8 Cable Chest Flys (not sure if he has these in his gym, probably not)

3x5-8 Regular Hinge Progression for now

Third Pair

3x5-8 I have no idea what alternative there is to dips

3x5-8 Start from wall pushups and continue onto one handed pushups

Core Triplet

3x8-12 Anti-Extension progression

3x8-12 Anti-Rotation progression

3x8-12 Extension progression

"Hey all,

My primary goals with body weight fitness are to become stronger, healthier and more resilient as I age. Secondary goals include aesthetics and the achievement of some skills associated with the practice. I’m in my low 30’s, have been training for a couple years and would like to build a strong fitness foundation now that will lead me to hopefully pain free movement and mobility in my later years. 

I’ve been doing some straight arm work like straight arm ring flys, straight arm dragon flags and increasing the time on my rto support holds. Are these exercises good for resilience of the joints or are they actually degrading them over time? Although not an impossibility in my mind, I don’t expect to be able to achieve some of the higher level straight-arm skills such as full planche and front lever in my time with this practice. As stated I am doing bwf and particularly straight-arm work with the expectation it will make my joints stronger for the future. Is this a valid assumption?

After some days of particularly strenuous work, I do feel aching in my elbows and sometimes shoulders but it goes away with a good nights rest and I am able to train pain free the next day. Also, I have noticed increased vascularity and mass around my elbow joints. I know this is skeletal muscle growth and not indicative of joint strength but it does make me feel like the stress I’m introducing through straight-arm work is working to fortify the joints. 

Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So basically my previous routine was like this.

15 sets of dips

15 sets of pull ups

70 jumping squat on stairs

30 sec rest between sets. All done 3 days a week with reps close to failure.

Even if it did help me build a great physique i wanted something new that i could actually progress overload with. So here is my new weighted workout(starting with a 7kg load).

1)5 sets of Weighted chin ups

2)5 sets of weighted push ups

3)5 sets of weighted squats

4)5 sets of calf rises

50 sec rest between sets and reps close to failure (done 3 days a week). I will progress by adding 1 kg per week and maybe 1 set per 2 weeks. Whats do you guys think of my workout? I just finished it and felt pretty tough (especially the push ups) but i wanted to know your opinion too.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been having difficulty in recovering from my workouts. Male, 5'6"" (167cm), 195lb (89kg), \~16-20% body fat. I like to train to be generally all around athletic and mobile - so flexibility, strength, endurance, jack of all trades master of none, though my primary goal is fat loss (I'd like to hit \~12% body fat and maintain that). I run twice a week for 30min, leg day twice a week for 30min, and upper body day twice a week for about an hour. I do a 20min yoga routine after each workout, so that's 6 days a week I'm active. I can provide more detail upon request, but usually when I run I just vary my pace depending on how I feel, I use a lower body calisthenics routine largely derived from knees over toes guy, and my upper body routine is mostly rings based from coach Sommer's book, about half of the workout on isometrics and the other half on dynamics.

  
I'm thinking about perhaps moving the running in concert with my leg day in order to grant me two additional rest days, but I'm not really sure if running after my lower body day is a good idea. I'd like to hear what other people have to say. I'm somewhat open to removing running altogether, which I've done in the past but I always eventually add it back in because I enjoy cardio and find its benefits useful.

I'll also add that my environment is generally stressful and that for sure impacts my recovery, but there isn't much I can do about that at the moment (I'm writing my dissertation as a PhD student, for one).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I am a teenager who was merely overweight. I used to weight around 83 kg. At the start of 2021 I decided to make a change and so I did I started working out at home very minimally. I was dropping weight. I was only doing cardio and not resistance training. Throught my journey until October I lost roughly 20 kg. But as I toned down my body fat percentage I quickly realized that I should start training for muscle growth. So I started doing calisthenics at home and also started bulking( eating in a surplus) Since then I gained 2 kg of weight( mainly muscle). But I do not really see the changes I want, I actually see very minimal changes and that frustrates and upsets me. Sometime when I workout I feel weaker than the last workout, so my motivation is running low. So I wanted to ask this community for tips, maybe you can help me.
Also this is my routine: 

Upper body day #1: Monday(3 sets ×10-15 reps each exercise)
Warmup
Frogstand progression 
L-sit progression
Pushups
Dips(band assisted)
Diamond pushups (on knee)
Skull crushers
Pike pushups( I cant do them very well)or lateral raises 
Inverted Rows
Pullups(band assisted)
Chinups (band assisted)

Lower body day #1: Tuesday( here I also add a little bit of weight)
Warmup
Frog stand progression
Elbow Lever progression
Leg raises 
Squats 
Glute raises
Bulgarian split squats
Lunges
Romanian deadlifts

"Hey all, had my tonsils removed 11 days ago for recurring strep infections. I’m an otherwise healthy 23M (184 lbs 6’ 1”).

I’ve noticed I’m breathing better post op and slowly now easing back into my routine. I feel like I recovered well from the surgery with no complications.

I have some concerns however:

1. For those who have had their tonsils out, have you noticed a positive / negative effect on your training / gains / health?
2. I came across a study that got some decent media attention 2 years ago providing a correlation between getting the tonsils out and upper respiratory infections / IBS. However, anecdotally I see most people have very positive reactions to their tonsils removal when it comes to post op infections. Do people have thoughts / experiences on this?

"Hello, i am currently doing the recommended routine with weight, i train with a 14 Kg vest (30.86 Lb?) and i currently perform 2 pull ups, 7 dips, 5 psuedo planche push up (i really doubt that with a good form, but without weigths maybe) and bulgarian split squat 8.

&#x200B;

I had gained a lot of strength doing this, but recently i was playing futball (i do not do any sport apart calisthenics) and i saw a bar and can not resist to do pull ups, a couple of co workers give me positive feed back, i never think in training to perform tricks or something, just for health, but this event encorage me to maybe learn some basic tricks.

The bad thing is that i do not know anything, besides the recommended routine i do not know how to start to practice tricks.

Some ideas or sugestions? i perform the rr 3 times a week (almost) and i really do not know if i could extend my training period more that 30 minutes more (i workout in the morning, maybe could do two routines one in the morning and one in the evening) so i was thinking in just ""play"" trying to achive the basic progression of certain tricks before the rr routine (planche, front lever and handstand), is this rigth? maybe perform or practice the tricks in the days i do not do the rr, but of course that leads to no rest time, or maybe just one day of tricks but that could slow down the trick progress.

any adice would be welcome, and also, i have some fat in the waist, maybe it is hormonal (i am 31 years old), but it will be a good idea to add cardio in the rest days?

"Hi all,

I've been trying to transition to more bodyweight workouts over the last 6 months. I've been doing 5x5 to build up a decent base for about 6 months before that, but I'm fairly weak in the shoulders and back due to an old lumbar injury. I can't do a single pull up unassisted but I can do 2 - 3 chin ups.

I came across this [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pullup?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pullup?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

And I notice down the bottom the poster says either pullups or chinups will do. I just wanted to get some opinions on whether or not it would be a good idea for me to just focus on doing chin ups as a way to transition into pullups down the line? I'm thinking of doing them a minimum 3 times a week, aware of the fact that I don't want to injure myself.

Any feedback would be great.

Cheers.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been working my way up to trying ring dips (don't have anywhere to do bar dips).  I'm up to 35seconds X 3 RTO support hold so thought I'd give them a go today. 

The only way I can get anywhere close to getting my elbow angle to 90 degrees is by leaning forward a lot.  I can feel my shoulders 'shrugging' upwards as I do this, presumably meaning I'm not keeping my scapulae fixed in position.  I realise this is bad form and I will continue to work on support holds for strength, but is a lack of shoulder extension whats holding me back here?

I youtubed some shoulder exercises and they all talk about importance of keeping the scapula retracted and depressed but this is very difficult.
Can anyone recommend me your favourite shoulder exercises and any cues to keep scapula position correct?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Cross-posting this from r/flexibility!

Hi all. After a small amount of research I’ve come to the conclusion that I should train towards achieving these 3 flexibility goals, once a week and about 45 minutes a session.

Would this be feasible enough to reach my goals of all 3? I’ve got decent overall flexibility I think as I’ve done yoga for quite a few years and generally have never thought of myself as inflexible. I would do this in tandem with the RR on my off days.

To expand from that, I have no clue what stretches I should do and how many. Should I focus on trial and error and tailor a routine to myself or is there any routines I should look at? I was looking at Kit Laughlin mastery series and they’re 40 each which is a bit too much for me right now. I’ve also seen the pancake routine in the FAQ skill day, would that suffice for pancakes?

"My primary goal with this movement is to strengthen and increase the size of my triceps. My secondary goal is to hit the pec minor. According to the American Council of Exercise, the diamond push-up is the gold standard for triceps exercises:

https://www.acefitness.org/certifiednewsarticle/3008/ace-study-identifies-best-triceps-exercises/

After doing diamond push-ups for some time, I reached 5 sets of 8 reps. I surmised the smartest way to progress the exercise would be to introduce a decline. Am I right to assume this? Will the triceps be targeted to a greater extent with the decline? When the decline is introduced, does the pec minor become more involved just like in a normal decline push-up?

"I was wondering if it’s possible to achieve a look like that with bodyweight excercises, and I mean without performing them weighted but just bodyweight, more like a prison workout. https://i.imgur.com/gN4x7mr.jpg

Of course in this particular case, a clean diet is essential, I’m aware of that.

All in all, he seems to have a pretty good chest, decent arms and possibly a lagging back, so my main doubt is that dips and push ups can give you that kind of chest.

I was thinking of something like that:

Chest: push ups (incline, wide, ring pushups), dips, ring flies

Back: pull ups (regular, neutral, wide, chin ups, narrow chin ups), rows (regular rows, wide rows, ring rows)

Shoulders: already working with pull ups, push ups and dips. Maybe lateral raises and facepulls

Arms: already working with chest and back excercises. Maybe ring curls and diamond push ups once a week

Legs: squats, deadlifts, pistol squats

Abs: various excercises

The variation I saw was like starting with elbows and turn into a regular dip, but what I’m doing is literally pushing myself up and down with my elbows. There’s less range of motion but I feel it may be hitting certain areas regular dips don’t.

"I recently got a watch that tracks my heart rate, and while tracking my weekly routine, I noticed I spend about half my time (total is ~1hr workout) in zone 0, so below 96bpm, and the rest in in zone 1 (115-133bpm), and a couple minutes where it peaks to zone 2 or 3 the highest it gets in ~160bpm when I do burpees to warmup in the beginning. 

At m28, I have a calculated max heartrate of 193, and measured resting hr of ~55 with about two weeks of wearing it; so just looking at heartrate it would seem my workout is actually pretty easy. But I've got moments when I breath hard and can workup a sweat even in ~ 4°C outdoor temperature, and I try to push myself when doing the last rep in a set. 

So my question: how useful is a heartrate monitor for BW workout? is it relevant to try stay in a certain zone? Do these measurements indicate I should crank up the difficulty of my workout, or do a more intense warmup?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi all. I’m 46, 185 cm and 86Kg (189 lb). I started the RR every 2 days for almost 6 weeks now. I started with the basic program, but quickly moved to progressions for some exercises which were too easy. I’ve not done any weight or bodyweight training like this before, i used to be an occasional runner.

For the first 4 weeks, i did the standard no of reps (5 usually) so that my body was adjusting. For the last 2 weeks for every workout I’ve increased reps by one for everything i can.

I’m not sore afterwards, but i do find myself on my knees during the third pair. My routine is

* Scapular Pull-up (10)
* Split Squat (11)
* Parallel Bar support Hold (60s)
* Floor Slides (9)
* Incline Rows (11)
* Full Pushups (11)
* Plank (30s)
* Copenhagen Plank (20s)
* Reverse Hyperextension (15)

Should I keep adding a rep every workout till i get to 15, then move onto the next progression, or will i quickly injure myself? Should i take the progression slower?

My body is starting to transform (I’m also eating at least 3,300 calories a day including almost 200g Protein). My physio saw me this week for the first time since i started, and he cant believe the change.

"Hey everyone 28M 186cm 95kg, its very important to set a goal for motivation and tracking improvements. 

My first goal is aesthetics and hypertrophy but currently I try to gain enough base strength with RR. I will discuss pull ups in this thread because my most trackable movements are them.

I want to add more isolation movements and regulate RR for hypertrophy when I reach 4x10 pull ups while I keep my body weight as it is.

"Hi guys im a new calisthenics lifter with muscle growth as the main goal and i'd like to know yall opinion on the matter, I dont count reps I just train a rep or two short of failure every set, my training is in order as follows with 1 set of each----wide pull ups, close grip pull ups, parallel pull ups, chin ups, dips, declined push ups, traditional push ups, diamond push ups, after this I do 5 sets of weighted squats, 3 sets of traps raises, 3 sets of calve raises, 6 sets of forearm raises and finish on 3 sets of seated rows for my rear shoulder and 3 sets of lateral shoulder raises.

"I've gotten into a nice routine that I really enjoy for about a few months now but trying to put on weight has been something I've had a hard time with. 

First I just tried to start eating more but then decided to try to clean up my diet. I'm a pretty skinny dude but still have a little bit of a bloated lower stomach I can't seem to get rid off. 

Have seen a solid improvement in my upper body but my legs are still really skinny and idk how to grow them. I don't use weights but going to start using bands which might help. Idk if eating differently would help leg growth too?

"Howdy, 

First time posting here.

So, I am 30M. Started working out 6 months ago. I see good progress as I am trying to recomp since I am fat. I went from 135kg to 115kg since the start of the year and my muscles have increased significantly (because I didn't use them in the past 10 yrs). The physical things I do are going to the gym, the store, and the cardio on a bike that I do in the morning. The rest of the time I sit in front of my computer, press buttons, and stare at the screen to make my boss happy so he gives me money for whey. So that said I think I have a good amount of energy I can spend in the gym so I've developed this split which I started in December:  


Day 1: Chest & Triceps + Some Abs

Day 2: Back & Biceps  
Day 3: Shoulders & Legs

Day 4: Triceps & Biceps + Abs  
Day 5: Chest & Back 

Day 6: Legs & Shoulders 

Day 7: Chill

I get up in the morning and do 30-40 minutes of cardio trying to keep my pulse 126 because (210 - 30)x0.7 to burn fat but not muscle.

I do around 4 exercises with 4 sets of between 8-12 reps for each group for the day. It takes me around 90 minutes with 1min+ rest between sets.   


My feeding is intermittent fasting. Usually:  


The morning after cardio: 1-2 whole eggs, 3-4 whites. 1 cup of oatmeals with 1 scoop of whey  
The afternoon after workout: 1 scoop of whey with greek yogurt, 1 banana, and a couple of rice cakes (sometimes with peanut butter)  
Late afternoon: Meat (pork, chicken, or sausage), veggies (salad), and some keto dessert the wife made. 

  
I need constructive criticism because everything I listed is based on only my learnings and thoughts. 

&#x200B;

I don't have friends around and especially no gym bros to talk fitness so your input will be valuable to me.   


Thanks a lot, guys. Peace","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi everyone, so I'm training for the one arm chin up, I do one finger assisted Chin ups on rings and Mantle Chin ups on rings (assisting ring lower). However with Mantle Chin ups I completely stopped progressing because I just can't pull high enough with my right arm. I don't know if it's normal, with my left arm I can pull till my chin is above the whole ring but with my right, I can barely get my chin above the bottom of the ring. What are the best Chin up progressions that I could replace the Mantle Chin up with? Archer Chin ups? Or should I do weighted Chin ups to build more strength? That would be limited though, because I train at the park and would have to carry weights in a backpack.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I am 47 and I’ve been doing the RR for 10 weeks now.

Ive been able to make good progression. When I started i thought id never get a pull-up, but I’ve gone from barely able to do scapular holds to 3x8 band assisted pullups in 10 weeks (I’ve made good progression on every exercise so far). I give a lot to the workout, I’m almost always struggling to get to my feet after the third pair of exercises.

I’m 185 cm and 88kg (190 lb or so ) and Ive been eating 3,400 calories a day (my TDEE is 3,100). I eat well, lots of whole foods, no refined sugar, 180 - 200 g of protein per day.

I just bought a digital scale (Withings) and it tells me that i have 23% body fat. I know that this may not be accurate, i could be 19-27%. However, my eyes agree, i can see lots of definition starting to show in my chest and shoulders, but i still have a belly.

What’s my best path forward if i want to look better? Should i

1. Stick with the RR and eat 3,400 and hope the fat burns and muscle grows?
2. Add some cardio to burn more fat (leaving me more tired/time poor)
3. Eat at 3,100 and continue RR
4. Eat at 2,700 and continue RR

I know that every person is different, so I’m looking for any general recommendations.

Thank you for reading.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi all,

I've been in and out of Calisthenics for several years on and off - never really got too deep with it.

This year I want to really try and make calisthenics part of my life so I installed Caliverse to try and ease back into it - the app has been ok but as I have rings I think I'll switch to using the rings.

I'm thinking of doing the RR on the rings, would this be a decent workout to switch to?  


\---

Mon, Wed, Fri  


Warmup / mobility (wrists, scapula etc...)  
Ring support hold 3x40s  


Set 1  
Ring chin ups  
Shrimp squat negatives / pistol squats / reverse nordic curls  


Set 2  
Ring bodyweight rows (I'm currently at like a 45degree angle)  
Ring push ups with typewriters at bottom position / Or Ring push ups into ring flies  


Set 3  
Ring tricep extensions, moving towards ring dips as strength develops  
Nordic curls  


Extra  
Hanging knee raises

\---  


I'm thinking 3 sets or 5-10 reps per exercise as strength dictates.  


I want to get really strong foundation then look at skills later in the year like Skin the Cat.  I might start doing L-sits and handstand training on Tuesdays and Thursday as an active rest n a few months though.

"[Ring muscle ups video](http://imgur.com/a/dt526sk)

Hi guys, I hope you can review my ring muscle ups form.
I try to start with straight arms, do the transition as slowly and controlled as possible and turn the rings out when I complete the dip. 
Unfortunately my bar height is not optimal so my leg position is awkward. 
On the eccentric I feel I'm shrugging my shoulders too much, but honestly eccentrics are still very hard for me so I think that I will be able to have a better form only with more training and time. 
This is the second time I attempt ring muscle ups and the first time I do them with a dead hang at the bottom, so please don't be too harsh. 
I'm still not able to turn the rings out between reps, I hope you will forgive me for that. 
As a side note, does ring height / strap length make any difference in terms of difficulty of ring exercise? Unfortunately at the moment this the highest point I can attach rings to. What about the width between the straps? Does that affect difficulty in any way? I was thinking of setting rings wider because they tend to cut the back of my forearms, but I wouldn't like to make the exercise too difficult now that I'm still trying to mastering it. I'm only able to do 2 reps back to back. 
Thanks to everyone that will be able to help me or at least try to.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hello Everyone,

This is probably a recurrent question here. Sorry for that...

I have been doing the recommended routine for 3months now, and I am almost at the final level of all the progressions. Thank you for the routine; it helps me get back in shape and feel better doing my everyday tasks.

So, I would like to get some suggestions on how to continue progressing. I am already using rings and weights, and I don't mind buying more equipment to do different exercises. My main goal is to increase my core strength and start seeing a better definition of my abs.

For reference, I am doing the recommended routine three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays); on Tuesdays, I am doing 1h15min of HIIT, and on Thursdays, a 15k run. Usually, Saturday and Sunday are rest days, but If I feel like it, I do a 50min body combat on Saturdays.

"Hello I'm a male teen, I've been working out for almost a year, though I've only started taking calisthenics seriously in the last few months and have been enjoying it greatly. I was setting out some goals for 2022. One of these was the Front lever. After doing some research I discovered that I needed to strengthen my pull strength (current pull up PR is 10 reps) and core strength. Just to state I absolutely love working out and I have no problem being motivated. This shouldn't take me a few months before starting out on the proper front lever progressions but I was wondering if u thought mastering the front lever was a realistic goal for 2022 or am I being set up for disappointment?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

A couple months ago I “started over” on my pull-up progress. I watched Dominik Sky’s video on the “perfect pull-up” and realized I was protracting my scapulas and rounding my back on most of my pull-ups at the time.

Since then I’ve tried to make an effort to actively retract and depress my scapulas through the whole movement. Is the effort shown in the video moving in the right direction? Trying to maintain retraction and depression makes pull-ups far more difficult IMO. 

I would like to set the foundation to improve my pulling strength in the long run. Should I incorporate other variations such as Lsit pull-ups? Thank you.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi! Can someone in a really simple way explain the best workout routine for building muscle mass using only bodyweight exercise and light dumbells, sliders and a booty band? 
I have tried to research but a lot of the articles confuse me with their fitness terms such as volume and so on.

Also to add a bit about me i have tried a lot of different home workouts, and i enjoy pilates and yoga the most and hiit the least. I am not a fan of super high intensity exercises or high rep ranges, so something in between would be ideal. As for cardio i hate running, but love walking/hiking/dancing.


Example i would understand: “to grow muscle you should do 3-5 sets of 10-12 reps for 3-4 exercises that targets the muscle - this should be done x times per week”

I incorporated supersets on my program 3 months ago and my workout decreased from 2 hours to 1.5 hours. I do the same workout and I'd lower the intensity sometimes if I feel crappy.

• 4x5-10 Weighted pull-ups (currently at 6reps and 7.5kg)
• 1st Superset, 
4x5-10 Pistol squats (currently at 6reps and 14kg),
4x10-15 Romanian Deadlifts 50kg (I use water tubs that have handles which weigh 25kgs each). 
Rest 3 minutes after each superset.
• 4x5-10 Deep Elevated Pike PU (3feet elevation)
•2nd Superset, 
4x25 Deep Calf raises,
4x20 Seated Straight leg raises.
Rest 3 minutes after finishing the whole superset. No rest in between sets. 
• 3rd Superset
4x5-10 Archer pushups (non-working arm elevated 1 foot),
4x10-15 Barbell Rows (I use water tubs also, which equates to 34kg). 
Rest 3 minutes after each superset.
•4x10-20 Barbell Bicep curls 15kgs.

"Not asking for medical advice, I am more curious about your opinion and experience.

I've been doing a test for a month and half where in one week I do bodyweight exercises like push ups, pulls ups, squat and their respective progression and in the other week I only walk and run.

It's just anecdotal, but in the cardio weeks I always sleep like a baby to the point I forget of being insomniac; on the other hand, when I do bodyweight exercises at home there are days where I get 2 hours of sleep. 

Nothing changes, I always finish my workouts 4/5 hours before bed and the intensity is medium in both type of exercises.

Do ""strength"" exercises affect anxiety and post workout euphoria differently? Is it because I do it at home while I do cardio outside?

"Hey everyone,

I know there's a lot of interest here for daily training. I love it and am always looking for ways to make it work because it's really easy to mess up. I recently picked up this tip after rereading some books by Pavel Tsatsouline: terminate your exercise/workout when your rep speed begins to slow down. Not when you start to struggle, but when your reps start to slow down in any way.

One thing I've always wondered with high-frequency training where you have to keep the sets ""easy"" (within your capacity) is how to be sure if you've done enough to stimulate growth. Monitoring rep speed involves a lot less faith and interpretation.

I've also found it useful after days where I push myself close to failure: I'll spend a few training days keeping reps crisp. The moment that falters, I wrap up the workout. My recovery has become easier to track with this method and I know when I can push myself again.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I participate in an annual fitness assessment and my aim this year is to achieve 60 push-ups in a minute, 60 sit-ups in a minute, and a 1.5 mile run in 10 mins. In designing my fitness plan to achieve this I was hoping for some advice on the reps I should target for each set in my workouts.

Below is my plan, any help and advice is greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;

PUSH-UPS

I aim to do 5 sets of 20 push-ups as a benchmark to know that I'm ready to do 60 in a single set. Is this an advisable number of reps? My plan is to do 5 sets of push-ups every day, increasing the reps every week until I achieve the desired number.

&#x200B;

SIT-UPS

I understand that planks are the way to do in order to develop core strength. With this in mind, how should I adapt my daily exercises to achieve the goal of 60 sit-ups in a single set? Is the goal perhaps 5 sets of 2 minute planks?

&#x200B;

RUN

Right now my goal is to work my way up to 3 mile runs, maybe thrice a week. From there if I improve my speed at 3 miles I believe I should have an easier time maintaining a higher speed for a 1.5 mile run.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello all.

According to calculators my (aproximately) maintenance calorie intake is about 2200kcal (175cm at 75kg).

I have a little bit of fat, I'd say I'm like the 16-19% percentage guy in this pic [https://imgur.com/a/2AUerzZ](https://imgur.com/a/2AUerzZ) maybe a little bit more but definitely not like the next guy.

So I tried to lose a bit of fat going down to 1800kcal, it worked for a bit. Then I dropped it to 1700 to keep losing the remaining fat but the fat stayed the same and I just lost muscle mass and strength, but not really that much weight, weird.

So after months of deficit I tried to gain muscle again because, well, I wanted to do cool calisthenic things and I couldn't advance if I was in deficit, right? So I pumped it to 2100-2200kcal daily, which is my maintenance, and zig-zagged it with two days of about 2500-2600 kcal for a surplus.

Well, nope, I thought the surplus was quite small (two days of +400 weekly would be like +115 daily) but I'm seeing myself gaining fat. Of course one explanation is my metabolism adapted to the lower intake, but even with that the surplus would be what, +200/300? I didn't start it too long ago (like 3 weeks ago max) and I already think my fat is more visible.

Any suggestions? Checked:  
\- Enough sleep.

\- Enough protein.

\- Low fries/sugar intake (but I'm weak, I'm not saying no to my chocolate bar as long as it's not more than 100-150kcal).

"I just recently achieved my full back lever and I'm trying to improve my hold times (my max is roughly 6-7 seconds now) and I'm trying to get it to over 10 seconds.

The problem I run into nowadays is that I'm unable to perform the back lever in consecutive training sessions even though I don't feel very fatigued (Eg. training on Monday, then training on Wednesday). As far as diet and sleep are concerned, I am eating more than enough and I sleep at least 7-8 hours a day.

On Saturday I was able to do 1x 7s hold and 3x 5s hold. Today, I was barely able to hold it for a couple of seconds. It's 2 days apart so I assume that it would be sufficient rest before training the move again. The amount of volume I do isn't really crazy.

My typical upper body workout looks like this:

\- Skill work: Back lever

3-4x holds

3x5 skin the cat 

Pull-ups: 3-4 sets 12-15 reps

Pseudo Planche push-ups: 3 sets 6 reps (reps constant, lean forward more for progression)

Horizontal rows: 3 sets 15 reps

Dips/straight bar sips: 3 sets 15-20 reps

Hollow body hold: 3 sets 45+ secs

I've been having some shoulder impingement issues in my left shoulder recently and done a ton of research today to come up with a routine targeted at fixing this. Before I get chastised about seeing a professional, I've spent the last 3 months and over $500 with a PT and am no further ahead, he's largely had me focused on band adduction/abduction exercises but I am starting to believe my issues stem from poor scapular mobility and strength and tight muscles all around my shoulder (lat, trap, pec).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I’m seeing better results doing pull ups twice per week on Mondays and Thursdays or Fridays than I ever did three times per week. Occasionally I’ll throw in an extra day or sometimes only once per week normally doing all out on those two days. In general my body has always performed better with a less is more mentality, once I got my body to a higher standard of fitness in the past I was able to do more but it was when I was competing at the national level for my sport and was all my time dedicated to rest and recovery.  But the reward to effort was still nothing in comparison to my lower volume training. Running for example I got much more out of 3 times per week with great structured runs rather than 5 runs a week.

Especially now as my body is a bit torn up from years of high level training and a couple years as a commando in the army on top of that I got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a couple years ago making training not always feasible like it used to be. Not even sure what this is maybe a rant?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
" Ten minutes ago, I started doing my leg workout. I finished the first set, took a break, and went to do the second set.

I was doing pistol squats on my left leg when my brain had too much of it. I lowered myself for the 5th rep, said: ""Fuck it"", and quit.

I didn't quit because my muscles were burning or hit failure. I gave up because I was tired psychologically. 

For the past two weeks, my rapid progress in all of my leg exercises has finally stopped. I couldn't progressively overload myself for four leg workouts in a row (I do PPL split). 

You have no idea how much dread and fear I experience before the leg day. I'm afraid of the pain I'm going to suffer. I'm scared of the discomfort and occasional burning feeling in my muscles. *What if I regress and fail to complete the prescribed amount of repetitions?*

I waste my evening trying to find a solution to this issue, to discover someone who has had the same problem and fixed it. 

Additionally, I've been seriously considering taking an entire week off training. The last time I did that that was one year ago for legs and six months ago for arms. 

If I don't make my training more enjoyable, I risk quitting all of this altogether. Can you help me? Would it be the right thing to take a small break? Do you perceive the same emotions as I do before a gruelling workout?

P.S. I've been training since the age of 8 (I'm 15 years old now).

I can probably count on my fingers how many times I've missed a workout in the last three years.

My primary goal is muscular hypertrophy with a bit of strength endurance.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been plateaued on my chinup reps at about 10-11 max for a good while now and I've finally managed to realize that I should probably add weight in order to actually progress. Issue is, I lack the equipment to do so (weight vest/belt etc.) and I don't really have the money to spare right now to shell out for that sort of thing. I was considering maybe throwing some kitchenware or books in a backpack to get the resistance I need, but I am aware that the weight distribution for something like that may not be entirely ideal, so I am of course open to any ideas that might have worked for you lovely folks","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I want to buy a weighted vest for bodyweight training because I need to spend my money quick as the inflation is really high in my country now and it's increasing. I'm thinking that some time in my life I'm gonna buy a weight vest anyway eventually so might as well buy it when the prices are cheaper. 

I was astounded when I saw how light most vests are. I'm 67kg and I can do about 12 dips, for example. I put about ~10kg of weight in a backpack and I did 8 dips. This is still out of the strength range and into the hypertrophy range and I want to also do sets in the 1-5 reps range in most movements and I will also get stronger and stronger in the future. Yet articles say that vests should not exceed 10% of your weight??? (6 kg in my case?)

And then you have movements like push-ups. I can do 33 normal pushups. I don't even know how much weight I'd need to put on so that my max pushup would become 5, and that's only now. Sure, you can progress horizontal push easier without weight but maybe you want to do something that stimulates the chest more without putting the load more on the shoulders (PPPUs) or triceps (diamonds) or without making it unilateral (archer/one-arm) or maybe I will simply like the movement more in the future because of its simplicity.

Am I overthinking this or underestimating how hard exercises get once you add more and more weight? I can't find a vest more than 30kg in my country that's not incredibly expensive and even those are hard to find.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello everyone, thanks for anyone taking the time reading this and providing any insight. Well, I think the title is rather self explanatory. My pullup game is terribly weak. I currently weigh 158lbs (72kg) for 5'11 (1M78). 

Fresh first set of pullups without any pre exhaustion, I can maybe squeeze between 13-15 pullups. The next set, I'll do at best 10. My third, I get 7. By my fourth set, I am absolutely fried and would be lucky to get 6 reps. I don't know why this happens. Pullups is the only exercise that I find really taxing and extremely tough to get consistent sets. For context, I mainly lift weights but I've always incorporated pullups. I can get a consistent amount of reps in any other excercise. Except pullups. I'm really to a point where I think I'm unable to get 4x12 4x10 pullups. 

If I leave my pullups as my last finishing exercise, I am literally a champ if I can get 4X7. 

What do you recommend so that I can increase my endurance?  Thank you","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi, you may remember me from this [thread some days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/s2xjtk/routine_with_a_focus_on_rotator_cuff/), here is the routine I'm currently doing.


## Warmup
Similar to the Recommended Routine, without the Yuri band warmup, because twisting my shoulder with my arm behind me hurts.

I'm addind some external rotation to warm me up

## First part

My routine structure is kinda the same as the RR: exercises are grouped, I'm doing 5 to 10 reps of each exercise, rest for 60 to 90 seconds, and continue.

Exercise| Comment
---|---|----
External rotation with a resistance band| Targets rotator cuffs
Squat progression| Similar to the RR
Pull Up / Lateral Pull Up progression| I'm using resistance bands to do some lateral pull ups


## Second part
Exercise| Comment
---|---|----
Face pull| ""Jeff from Athlean-X there"". This exercise continues to train my rotator cuff, with a bit of a ""rowing"" component, and some core stability
Hinge progression | Same as the RR
Push Up / Overhead press (with resistance band)| Push ups are a bit too hard on my shoulders, I'm trying to do overhead presses to see if it's less straining.

## Third and last part
Exercise| Comment
---|---|----
[Plank rotation](https://www.getstrong.fit/Plank-Rotation-How-To-Exercise-Guide/Exercises) | Trains my core and helps stabilize my shoulders
[Swimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgX9kMxHmsc&t=822s)| I don't really care for hyper extension exercises, this one trains my lower back.



Any advice? Thanks for reading","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I love doing single leg loaded squats on some sort of platform(so not exactly a pistol). It's currently my primary leg exercise, as gyms are closed here, and I can't powerlift.

Problem is, my left leg is super weak at balancing, so once I start loading close to my 1RM, I have a hard time keeping balance.

Another example, are single legged deadlifts. I can easily do them continuously on my right leg, but the left one struggles, and I have to readjust or rebalance with every rep. Most reps I can't even finish.

Interestingly, my left hip is far more flexible, when it comes to stretches like the figure four yoga position. My left hamstring is also more flexible. 

How can I develop this balancing strength in a single leg?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey fellas.

I am a 19yo male (174cm, 70kg) who has been doing bodyweight training for about 2 years on and off. I a currently preparing my self to join the Danish army. Because of this, my main focus is cardio, but I would also like to build up my strength. I have a few different goals, but for this post I will be focusing on pullups.

Currently, I can do 10 pullups before failure. I would like to get up to 15 before I join, which I will in about 1,5 years. So my first question is: is this a realistisk goal?

Second is the question in the title: What is the best progression for me? In my workout, I usually do 3 sets of 5 regular pullups. I believe that a good progression would be pullups with tucked knees, then L-sit pullups, then weighted pullups. Is this a good progression? Do any of you have a better idea?

"Hey all, kind of a weird question.

I've been unable to do my usual exercise routine (and pretty much any exercise) for about a year now. Over the past three years, I've been doing a modified RR and running/yoga on the side as my source of exercise. Over the last year, though, I've had problems: I hurt my knee seemingly without specific trauma, and the surgery to fix that hasn't healed right and it hurts to walk and bear weight with the knee bent; my right elbow started hitching last October; my left elbow now hurts to bear weight on it; and none of it is really healing on its own or even with cortisone injections. None of it has had a specific injury related to it. I've seen a rheumatologist who, over the past several months, has said I ""probably"" have some sort of autoimmune condition but hasn't been clear whether that's what's been causing these acute, persistent injuries or been able to give me a specific treatment or diagnosis. I'm going to continue pursuing stuff on the medical side, of course, but I really want to resume exercising to some degree and am not really sure what I'm capable of beyond abdominal exercises and some mildly uncomfortable walks.

Anyone ever been in a similar situation before? Exercise was my main way of dealing with stress/anxiety, and I really feel like I've been left adrift without it over the past year.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hey everyone, I´ve been doing bodyweight training for around 8 months now. I recently got a weighted vest and I´d like to use it to progress on my journey. From what I read online, the idea is to either use it to get out of a slump (not seeing progress for a bit) or when you´ve already hit a desired max rep and want to take it further. For example, if I´m looking to do 6 to 8 reps of an exercise and I manage to do 8 reps for multiple workouts (I was thinking 3 to 5), I would add 4 kg with the vest and continue until I can do 8 reps again, then add more weight and so on. The same thing if I´m trying to do 6-8 reps but have been stuck in 6 reps for multiple workouts (again, I was thinking 3 to 5), though I´m not sure if I should stop after using the vest for a bit and see if I can manage more reps than before. If someone could let me know if this is fine or whether I should go about it differently, I´d appreciate it. Do you have any other tips you´d like to share?

"Hello,

So I've been training for about a year now and definitely made good strength gains following the rr. I often find myself getting out of breath after a single set(say pullups I do somewhere between 9-11 reps a set). I find that I need to rest for a much longer time than ideal and often spend more time on my workouts then I'd like. 

To give you some numbers, I'll do a set of pullups, rest 3 mins do shrimp squats then I'll end up resting 5+ minutes before I do pullups again because I'm so out of breath. What are some good ways to build up work capacity so I stop getting so out of breath. Would being really strict with my rest times help? It would probably be a struggle and I'd imagine i put up lower numbers but overtime surely I'd adapt?

I was also thinking of maybe just throwing in a set of max rep bw squats at the end of each workout. My thinking is this would build up my work capacity as I'd be doing 50+ reps and I'd get some nice leg endurance too which is always good for hiking and sports.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"The RR has been great to me over the last 1.5 years but I have found my progress stalling and somedays I do not have the energy for a full body workout.  Lately I have found some success in taking the RR and splitting it into 6 days, while adding a few movements as well. My current routine looks like this;

Day 1 and 4- pull ups (hollow body hold), hamstring slides (weighted), pike push up

Day 2 and 5- dips (weighted), calf raises (weighted), plank variations (weighted)

Day 3 and 6-  horizontal rows (weighted), squat (weighted), pushup (weighted)

I do 4 sets of each exercise, i usually aim for 8 reps, the last set i will sometimes do to failure depending on how I feel that day. I do all 3 exercises for that day in a row and then take a 3 minute rest.

My biggest concern is that I do not have as many rest days like with the RR but my workouts have gotten significantly easier to complete and only take around 30 minutes to complete.  I have seen some progress with this method but it is nothing spectacular.  The biggest benefit is that it keeps my workouts short and I am able to do them consistently.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey guys, I have a bit of a weird theoretical question concerning the ab wheel. I broke my foot some time ago so I'm doing what I can with limited equipment at home for now (wheel, bodyweight, dumbells). I don't have a pullup bar at home so I'm fairly limited when it comes to back exercises until my foot recovers.

Now, I know that you're not technically supposed to feel the upper back when rolling out using an ab wheel, and if you do you're probably compromising your form somewhere. But theoretically, is doing it in a manner to where you *do* engage your upper back more on purpose an effective back exercise?

When I roll out the full distance (parallel to the floor) I can feel my upper back working and it feels good. I could feel my lats engaging as well. But, is it effective, or just a dumb way to get injured?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I'm doing weighted one legged squats, that is, standing on chair to allow the other leg to come down and the back to straighten, with 10kg, usually 3 sets of 6 or 7. I'm 67KG body weight, and I'm having tendon problems.

Ever since I have started doing weighted one leg squats, I my tendons on the side of my leg, connected to the muscle running up from my ankle to the outside of my knee (I think it is the fibularus longus tendon) get sore and then disappear after a couple of days. It happens on either leg, and it doesn't happen all the time. Walking seems to help a lot, but basically I need to wait about 4 to 5 days to do the next set or else I risk getting tendon problems soreness again. Any strenuous activity risks problems, after which I have to wait about a week before working out again (wait until there is no pain working out). I never work out on a sore tendon, and I always warm up by doing 15 normal squats and 5 assisted one leg squats, as well as some basic cardio. At the moment, I'm doing weighted one leg squats every 4 to 5 days.

Is this normal? I have only done one leg squats (and pistols) for about 1 year, maybe my tendons aren't ready for the strain? I'm not sure what else I can do, and I've deloaded multiple times. Perhaps I'm not warming up enough? I always check to see if there is pain before doing them and I always stop at the slightest feeling. Perhaps I need to return to normal squats when there is pain to rehab tendons? I've been stuck on 3 x 5 at 10kg for 5 to 6 MONTHS due to this and only recently have gone to 3 x7.

"I'm doing an upper lower/core routine where I do the regular recommended routine work in two days (for personal reasons this works best for me) and for upper day I do chin ups, push ups, inverted rows and dips. I've seen lots of progress in a lot of areas of my body by just adding weights to each of these movements and would recommend them tremendously to anyone interested in a basic simple routine. But I'm not seeing as much progress in two areas, upper traps, and rear/side delts. So I'm considering adding something for them on the lower body day just because the upper day gets my arms extremely tired by the end of it already.

So I'm interested in focusing on the upper traps and rear/side delts, I found that handstand pushups seem like a good option, would doing them the day after regular (weighted) pushups interfere with arm/chest recovery and I'd struggle with them? And are handstand shrugs a better option for upper traps? 

Also, how would I go about implementing both inverted rows and face pulls for the rear delt work? Should I only stick to one or should I do sets of both in the same day/different days? 

And finally, any suggestions for isolated side delt work would be appreciated. Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Gaggi Yatarov (one of the best italian calisthenics athlethes) developed this method to reach the goal of 20 reps in one set of pullups.  
Basically it's a 5x5 where, whenever you fall short of the set's rep number, you substitute the rest of the reps with a negative. So, if in the third set you manage to do only 3 pullups you add 2 negatives and then you go on with the scheme restin 40"" between sets. To progress further, when you are able to do a 5x5 with 40"" rests, you cut rest down until 10"" between sets and theoretically you should be able to do 20 reps by that point.  
Do you think this method would be as effective as a russian fighter program? It's the first time I've heard of substituting concentrics with eccentrics basically mid set.

"My goal is to look muscular/gain size and not be strong. strength is not my goal. 

what is the optimal way to achieve this?

I’m aware of Hypertrophy and i’ve based my training in it. What is the best way to achieve this?

it seems like a lot of bodybuilding is based in gaining strength. and i find it hard to find resources for size/aesthetic training.

and even when it’s brought up it usually ends with people saying “some doctors agree. some don’t. so don’t worry about it”

but even if focusing on hypertrophy increases my muscle size by 10% i’d still be interested in knowing how to do it. 

i saw this comment on a reddit post about Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy. It seems relevant to my goal. it’s the top comment on this thread

"Anterior Pelvic Tilt and all the hoopla around it seems to be another myth propagated by the fitness industry to benefit off from people's vulnerability. 

This video summarises the entire concept: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0gWf7CkPo&ab\_channel=E3Rehab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0gWf7CkPo&ab_channel=E3Rehab)

The point in the video that struck me was when the narrator says that most people sit with a posterior pelvic tilt with hip flexed. I was confused about this when countless videos and blog posts say that people continuously sit with their pelvis anteriorly tilted. I just wondered how. Don't their lower back give out. 

So all these videos about correcting your APT and stuff are just trying to sell stuff to gullible commoners like us. Watch the video and use your own judgement. Unless someone is medically in a situation (maybe because of surgery or fractures, etc), I see no reason why someone will stay in severe APT all day or a mild apt is a problem.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I do my own slice of the RR at home. Currently I have a doorframe pull up bar and a dip stand which I also use for horizontal pulls. I am trying to put together a calisthenics gym at home (in my basement) and was wondering if I could get some equipment suggestions. 
I am contemplating getting a rack because it would be easy to hang rings from that. Not entirely sure if I can hang rings any other way. The rack would also give me the freedom to do pull ups and other skill based moves like front level, dragon flag etc.

"Hey y'all. I've been  doing the RR, starting with the primer, for about 5 months and have had a lot of success in improving my strength and some body recomp. Everything's going great...except one thing.   


Pull ups.   


I've seen it said by lots of different people that your push/pull exercises are supposed to be roughly equal to avoid imbalances. While my progress with push ups has been great I plateaued with pull-ups at the beginning of August and haven't made much progress since. I've tried all of the tips I see on this subreddit, I tried Hampton's advice from youtube, I tried greasing the groove. I've watched 100 videos and read 100 posts and blogs about this.  I've been doing rows and negatives, and band assisted pull ups and I'm not getting any progress.   


I thought that I was being impatient but after 2 months my best workouts peak at 3x6. I suspect that losing some weight might help but I'm not very overweight (6'1"" 200 lbs) and my weight isn't stopping my progress in any other exercise. Just this one.  


Any advice aside from just doing the same stuff? Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Hook kick, roundhouse kick, side kick, spinning back side kick, axe etc. Also doing 100 punch per type per day with all those Karate stance.

Now, i'm planning to train my muscle again as I feel like I'm lossing my muscle. With limited of time of particularly training my muscle, do you guys think that if I only do 100 push up, pull up and weightless squat per day is good enough? I will break it down to 4 set for each movement.

"Hey all, so I've been doing the RR and variations of it for a few months now, with reasonable success. However, I'm still pretty behind on my push-up capacity.

For example, I'm at nearly-horizontal rows for inverted rows and can easily do much more than my initial limit, and I've definitely progressed on exercises like deadbugs and ring ab rollouts/planks. But for push-ups, I'm still at incline push-ups, I've barely even managed to lower the incline, and I can still only barely manage the amount that I started at, 3x8 reps... my arms just begin to give out.

What can I do to improve/increase my push-up capacity? Are there any exercises, stretches, etc. that I can do at home? (Right now I have access to a gym -- and I try to do a bench-press, squats, barbell rows, and deadlifts there at least 2-3 times a week -- but gyms are closing and I'm not sure how safe it'll be to go for the next month, so I'm preparing to do as much of the RR as I can at home.)

"Hey bodyweight fitness community! I (33M) have been training (recommended routine) on and off since lockdown, around May of 2020. Before this I had no formal training and pretty minimal workout experience.  I have really come to appreciate this community for its guidance and impact. I recently moved to a new place, and have my own gym set up at home, and as I'm starting to get back into training, I decided to reach out and get some advice/feedback on my form.

"Hey everyone,

I have been actively doing BWF and going to the gym for almost two years now with the frequency of about 3-5 a week (generally 5, but some weeks are weaker due to lack of time). I went from 62kg with 1.88m (pretty thin, yeah) to 74kg while reducing my body fat. 

My problem is that I always feel like my body weights too much on its own. I occasionally do cardio, but not that much to avoid losing the little body fat I have. I eat a lot of calories (I count up until 2200 daily and generally go a bit over it). 

I have been considering starting some fighting sport, such as boxing or similar, to try and get used to moving faster. But at the same time, I feel like maybe the problem lies somewhere else and that the sport would just be too exhausting, since I generally just feel really tired all the time.

I generally sleep 7.30-9h a night, I have pretty regular schedules, rarely drink, no drugs, last year I did overall physical and blood exams and everything was A-OK. Maybe it's something I'm missing on my meals? But I think I eat pretty much all types of food (Mediterranean diet). Could also be the depression, since I was diagnosed quite a while ago, but I know a lot of people with depression who can physically move fast without any problems.

Thanks in advance if anyone has some advice or something.

"Hi all! My local gym just closed due to covid and I won't be able to get back any time soon. I've been going to the gym for about 1,5 years, with the last 6 months being more seriously focussed on progression.

I've always used the machines and not so much free weights for my lower body. I have been able to get my hands on resistance bands, booty bands, 2 3kg dumbbells and a stability ball. But I'm completely lost and don't know where to start with a routine that's not weight focussed. 

My normal routine consists of leg press, hip thrust, hamstring curl, hip abduction, leg raise and some time on the stairmaster.

I have hypermobilty syndrome and my knees and lower back ache fast, so that's something I'll have to keep in mind. So far I am thinking:
- fire hydrants
- glute bridge
- hamstring curl (stability ball)
- backwards lunges
- step ups
- Bulgarian split squats (with dumbells)

What should I add or exchange? I'd like my workout to be glute heavy. I normally have 2 upper and 2 lower body days and do a bit off abbs on all days.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"So I've decided to go on a little journey called 'planche', the last major obstacle before I can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete. And I've given myself 4 months to do it.

This is where I'm currently at (filmed end of December): https://streamable.com/fkzlbt

That was about RPE 7. Right now my balance gives out before my strength does (can't even do a proper headstand for more than 8 seconds, another thing I will be working on), but I fully understand that my shoulder, chest and back strength is going to need a massive upgrade to pull this off.

So why 4 months? Because that's what works best for me. I got my first iron cross after 4 months of specific training. Anything longer than that and I tend to burn out and regress, so 1/3 of a year for a strength training cycle is the best I can do.

My 4 month training cycle will go from being about 40/60 strength/hypertrophy that it is now to about 80/20 strength/hypertrophy, doubling my strength training volume. Basically, I'll be training as a power lifter.

I will also be working heavily on the antagonist muscles to avoid postural imbalances, which means I'll also be training heavy for front lever and p-bar victorian, but after I do my planche block in the training session.

This will be the first time I share my calisthenic training journey with anyone and I mainly wrote this post to hold myself accountable (so no slacking off!!) and maybe get some tips and support from you guys. I'll be doing monthly updates until month 4, so stay tuned.

I'm getting started with the RR here but I'd like to shorten it due to lack of time (full time job, CS master's, volunteering). Here's what I've been doing for the past couple weeks:

"Hey guys, in the uni where I'm at we're starting to get to that ""exams every god damned week"" time of the year. 

Since I have a hard time concentrating for long, I'm trying out the Pomodoro Method, which is basically studying super focused for 30 minutes and then resting for 10 minutes to replinish focus before you even start getting distracted, so that you can be really productive. For now, it's really working! 

The problem is, with so much studying, chores and preparing meals (and trying to get 8hrs of sleep lol), I would get distracted and really stressed if i tried to train for like 1:30 hours like I usually do.

Seeing an extended laundry list of movements in a routine is such a turnoff for me. Considering the large of muscles compound movements hit, I never felt it necessary to have such a long list. My own:

- **Chinups**:  Narrow-grip/hollowbody. I've completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. At the very last rep of a set, I hold at the very top to allow the biceps/core put in some extra work. Try it! They also build some pretty awesome abs. 

- **Dips**: Often with 35lbs between the legs. It's fun knowing that my pecs which I've been complimented on in a few occasions were built using my mom's plastic medical walker. It sits in my room since it takes up practically no space so I can crank out some reps on a complete whim; convenient, amazing.

- **Legs**: Got me here. I'm lazy in this department. Sometimes it's goblet squats, air squats, BSS. Finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here, in between my occasional hikes.

- **ETC**: Kettlebells. Walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so I'll occasionally do a few cleans/rows, whatever. Just some random spontaneous movements for functional strength building.

1. External rotation with the elbows flared out. [Example](https://youtu.be/T3G2JdmtLiI?t=82) (watch 1:15). This is also achieved with the [ring face pull](https://youtu.be/5xC9DpNA2-4?t=91) (watch 1:35)
2. Side lying external rotation. [Example](https://youtu.be/-NA8lUy5_Qc?t=233) (watch 3:54). A bilateral alternative is the [bent elbow band pull apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JkED7EFZaA)

Based on what I've read so far, the first variation isolates mostly the [supraspinatus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Supraspinatus_muscle_back4.png/600px-Supraspinatus_muscle_back4.png) muscle, while the second variation isolates mostly the [infraspinatus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Infraspinatus_muscle_back2.png) \+ [teres minor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Teres_minor_muscle_back3.png).

So I guess that, if I did just variation #1 or variation #2 (only), I'd not be training my shoulders external rotators in a complete way, right?

I mean, is it necessary to isolate both supraspinatus and infraspinatus, doing a specific variation for each one?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I recently started the recommended routine. I've been doing it for almost a month and my current routine is as follows.

3x5 wide grip pull-ups 
3x8 goblet squats with 50lb kettle bell
---
3x5 dips with rings
3x8 romanian deadlift with 40lb kettle in each arm
----
3x6 wide grip row with rings
3x8 pseudo planche push-up
--- 
plus my own ab routine since I have a muscle imbalance in my lower back.

I do this before or after school Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I also have boxing in my off days
1 hour Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I stretch daily after I workout and should be running but right now I'm just trying to boost my strength and muscle mass so I keep the cardio light. 

Today my coach asked me to start coming in Mondays, and Wednesdays, so that means boxing 5 days a week. I'm not sure how, or if I should alter my routine. I know I need to start doing the RR in the morning before school but wanted to see if anyone else had any good suggestions. I was using boxing as my skill day, doing most of my calisthenics before class. 

For reference I'm a 16 year old Male, have a very healthy diet and I eat a lot, around 4k calories daily, as well as taking 5g of creatine daily. 

I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting. I hope this info is sufficient to describe my current problem.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello all,

I’ve recently been dealing with pain in my shoulder that after some conversations with my doctor have led to my conclusion that I am dealing with shoulder impingement. I have been attempting to alleviate some of the pain with body weight exercises in place of my usual lifting, and am yet to see any serious results. 

One exercise I have repeatedly seen mentioned is hangs off of a pull-up bar to stretch the shoulder. When I do this, it feel pretty good until I go to push my head “through” my arms and retract my scapula a bit more. This movement causes more pain, and more interestingly, usually makes my shoulder “pop” as I can literally feel one of the muscles slide forward quickly as if it was previously caught on something.  Wanted to post this here to see if anyone else had had an experience similar to this, and if so, what you did to improve your symptoms. Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I've been doing calisthenics on and off for years now and the muscle up was something I was never able to achieve. I even managed to hold a back lever for about 5-6 seconds and I still felt like the muscle up was an exercise that I wasn't capable of doing.

I'm able to do 15-16 strict pullups, so I knew it wasn't a strength problem but a technique one. A few days ago I tried doing a ""slow"" muscle up where I just try to pull myself up and over the bar. I was surprised how close I actually got, and I managed to do a chicken wing slow muscle up.

And then it hit me. It's all about the grip! When I was doing the slow muscle up I was using a ""pseudo"" false grip, where I'm basically pulling by using my wrist, and my fingers are over the bar.

So after all of that I try to do a normal kipping muscle up. I'm using a false grip but a bit different from the pseudo false grip, so my fingers are over the bar and my thumb is still under the bar offering support. The false grip makes it so if you have the necessary strength, you don't have to rotate your wrists at all you just pull and push yourself up the bar. On my first attempt I was just a BIT off being able to push myself up, and on my second one I got it :)!!! I'm so happy!! 

So to summarize, if you're like me, and you watched dozens and dozens of videos on how to do a muscle up and struggled, that's how it worked for me. Use a false grip when you hold the bar(fingers over the bar and thumb under the bar for the extra pulling power), swing a bit forward and when you are going back use the momentum to pull and push yourself up.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been doing the recommended routine for about 3 years now.  Absolutely love it and got me to a place where I feel fit and proud of my physique.

Had a couple injuries (skateboarding) and took the month of December off to heal.  Just last week I started easing in little workouts.

Would it be viable to essentially stretch the recomended routine over the 8 hour work day?  Like many I now work from home, and I'd rather immediately start working with small breaks every hour than my previous workout schedule of 1 hourish in the mornings.

Any downside to this approach?  I don't have any professional fitness goals, I would like to simply remain fit","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Morning all,

I've been a bit silly last few weeks & ramped up my muscle-up/explosive pull ups/ weighted pull ups frequency dramatically, picture greasing the groove technique but with maximum intensity & failed to supplement it with stretches, connective tissue work with bands ect 

Now I have an annoying pain in my inner elbow, I'm sure is the early signs of tendinitis or golfers elbow, has anyone had this before & have some effective tips for recovery? I've rested a week and in between then gone to the gym twice to just do some light push movements, it doesn't seem to be getting any better, shall I just completely rest until it heals?

i’m 17, 59kg, 170cm, 6 months into training. let’s take the nutrition part out of the discussion and assume i have good nutrition, is this routine properly structured?

4 sets of pike push-ups
4 sets of push-ups
3 sets of dips
4 sets of tricep kickbacks
4 sets of lateral raises

-

4 sets of chin-ups
4 sets of body rows
3 sets of barbell rows
3 sets of bicep curls
4 sets of barbell squats 
4 sets of romanian deadlifts

2 mins rest between exercises. rep ranges are 6-15, intensity is high, failure at last set. aiming for hypertrophy.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I'm curious about your personal opinions on certain calisthenics exercises vs Weight training exercises for muscle hypertrophy? I have a bodyweight program incorperating gymnastic rings and weighted calisthenics that incorperate some of the following exercises for when the gym is closed due to covid.

Which do you think is more effective and why, for muscle hypertrophy provided additional weight and progression can be applied to both?

Inverted Ring Rows vs Barbell Rows

Ring Pull Ups vs Bar Pull ups

Chest Dips vs Bench Press vs Weighted Deficit Push Ups

Pike Push Ups vs Shoulder Press

Bag Bicep Curls  vs Barbell Curls

"So I’ve been training my abs almost every day for at least 2 months now and I’m very pleased with my progress. I have made significant gains in core strength and endurance, as well as aesthetic gains in making my abs pop. I’ve been using a pull-up bar on my doorframe and I’ve been doing at lot of hanging leg raises with shoes and ankle weights to make it more challenging. I’ll do reps until I can’t anymore and then after only like 15-30 minutes of rest I can do more high intensity sets and reps. When I do chest stuff such as bench press Once I’m fatigued I can no longer work the chest muscles for quite awhile. Should I be worried about overtraining or do abs just naturally recover faster than other muscles?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I recently quit weight training in favour of calisthenics as I found calisthenics to be far more responsive for me in terms of hypertrophy (I still don't exactly understand why this is).

Thing is, I want to get a weighted vest because my strength is progressing quickly and the work is becoming too easy now. I would like to find a vest with a max load capacity of at least 30KG to give ample room for progressive overload.

I got one of these high capacity weighted vests in the past but it tore at the seams and I had to send it back to the seller.  So does anyone have any they can recommend? If size is a factor in recommendations, I am 6'0 and 176 lbs.

"So you bust your butt and learn the planche...or planche Pushup...or whatever.  Cool, great.

So now you want to move on to deadlifting?  Or mass building, or running.  Whatever.

But you don't want to lose your skills/strength.  How do you maintain it?

I recall reading (somewhere) that Pavel recommends 2 sets of 5 once a week.  Does that jive with other's experiences?  Are there any resources you'd recommend for other insights?

What about strength without the skill component?  Maintaining your bench press?  Or maybe endurance; you work up to 100 pushups; how do you maintain it?

Thanks in advance","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi guys, I've been following the RR for 6 months and I've improved a lot strength-wise but I'd like to target muscle hypertrophy (size) now. 

My first question is: should I do more total volume with less reps per set or more reps per set but less total volume to target muscle size? Let's take bodyweight dips for example:

4 sets x 8 reps = 32 reps | more overall volume but less reps per set

3 sets x 10 reps = 30 reps | less overall volume but more reps per set

I tried doing my research but I can't figure out which one is better than the other for size (dips are just an example in this case). I think the first one should do it since I theoretically have more time under tension. The ""set ranges"" for hypertrophy I keep seeing are 2-3 sets so I'm kind of confused on what approach I should take. 

I also have other misc. questions that I can't really figure out by myself:

\-Are 4x5 Pull ups and 3x5 Chin ups ""enough"" for back development? I don't feel like adding extra rows and such because my back is pretty sore after chin/pull ups.

\-Is it still worth it doing pull up negatives after being able to do a 5x5 pull up comfortably?

\-Since my regular chin ups are still not in the ""hypertrophy range"" is it a good idea to do 2x12 Australian chin ups after my regular chin ups to maximize bicep size gains?

Thanks in advance.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi.

I will get to the point:

Is it possible to increase pushup reps while building muscle? If so how, like what methods could I possibly use?

I currently do hypertrophy workouts for chest, shoulder and tricep, and I was wondering if I can increase my pushup count while not lowering the amount of muscle I could _possibly/potentially_ build? How can I do this, i.e. should I do hypertrophy and endurance in a workout? Or keep a routine of 1 endurance and 2 hypertrophy per week?

So, basically I want to still be able to build as much muscle as possible while being able to increase my reps.

OR should I do Grease The Groove instead and keep doing hypertrophy workouts, as I want to bring my reps from 40 to 60-70+? I have heard a lot about it and that I has brought some excellent results.

Thanks a lot!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

* **rings leg raises** (and/or deadbugs and/or planks & side planks)

"So I've come across some posts where people have mentioned doing weighted push ups, pull ups, dips, etc.

I was going to try this out but I am a little confused as to how you know when to switch from just your bodyweight to added weight? Is there a magic set/rep number that you reach and if there is how do you know what that number would be?

For example, if I can do 5 sets of 25 push ups without fail.. someone might say to add weight. So my other question would be what would be the difference between adding a few more push ups to each set vs adding weight? Is the addition of weight for the sake of time/efficiency? Or could you get the same results by adding more reps?

I'm not against the idea just looking for better information on it is all.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"[Strict (semi) slow muscle up video](https://imgur.com/a/8b8AndN)

Hi guys, can you please review the form of my second ever strict slow bar muscle up? Is the pulling phase too fast to consider it a slow muscle up? I don't think it really matters honestly, since I believe the speed of the pulling phase doesn't affect the difficulty of the transition (which is the hardest part), as long as no momentum is generated. 

Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to train this movement a often in the near future, because it puts a lot of stress on my elbows and I tend to suffer from golfer's elbow so... I was just happy to discover I was able to do it and I was wondering what you guys think of my technique. 

I know I'm using a pseudo false grip, which makes it easier, but I wasn't able to test the regular false grip because my elbow was already starting to ache after just 3 or 4 attempts. 

Last but not least, is it possible that I can do slow ring and bar muscle ups and find them not so difficult, but I'm still not able to do explosive bar muscle ups consistently? Or maybe I am just missing the technique and timing? 

Thanks in advance to anyone that will be able to help me","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I do 3 core exercises at 3 sets of 8-10 reps: ring roll outs, ring pallof press, and hanging leg raises. With every other muscle group I feel muscle activation during the exercise and then some tightness or soreness the day after. I know that pain isn't an indicator of exertion but I still don't feel that much activation during the exercises when isolating the abdominal muscles. 

Maybe I already have a strong core and need to move to harder variations or I'm doing something wrong?

My question is why is it way easier to do pull ups with regular grip [not the neutral, chin up grip] when I hold it closer/narrower. When I try to hold it to the edge (curved side of the regular grip) it gets infinitely difficult given and feels like my frame is not meant for it.

I have tried to stimulate them with multiple exercices that I have removed or kept in my program (Bodyweight curls during 5 months, Pelican curls during 6 months, One arm chin up progression that I have kept in my program).

I have even tried to isolate them with some dumbbells exercices (which is no more the case). I also tried to work on the brachialis. I don't feel that my biceps are growing even when I have progressed on all this exercices. That's why I'm asking for advice here.

"So I’ve found a cardio plan that has been working really well for me and am considering applying it to resistant training. What I do is have a weekly goal to jog/walk at least 15 miles each week.

With lifting, I struggle to follow through with my weekly routine. So I was thinking of trying a weekly goal and allowing myself to break it up however I want, doing whatever exercises I feel like and just keeping track on paper until I’ve done it all for the week. Something like:

Chinups: 80
Pullups: 75
Crunches: 200
Trap shrugs: 100

"In my efforts to try to keep in shape during these unprecedented times, I've started a small bodyweight exercise routine. Sadly, I'm finding that my body thinks I'm a delicate flower that must be protected at all costs.

Pushups? Sore wrists. Yoga poses that involve being on all fours? Sore wrists. I tried doing them from closed fists for a while and ended up bruising knuckles on both hands, despite being on a carpeted surface. I have the all constitution of a sickly Victorian child.

So I'm investigating pushup bars/handles to protect my wrists a bit better. Unfortunately, I have tiny hands. Like really, really tiny. The handle part of most pushup bars looks so wide that I'd effectively just be putting my palms on a flat surface again. I exaggerate slightly, but in reading some of the reviews for Amazon Canada's most-purchased solutions, I've been warned off almost all of them by other people with wee baby hands.

Any suggestions? I tried getting a pair of dumbbells to use but the gap between floor and handle was too small, and I don't know how big a set I'd need to buy to ensure enough space. I'm in Canada, so stuff that I can buy on Amazon Canada (or other Canadian retailers because fuck Bezos) is ideal.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

* Wide pull-up—3-4x6-12
* BB Row
* Pelican curl — 3-6x10
* Power cleans – 3-5x3-5 
* Weighted Chinups 4 — 9x6 /

* Deadlift 3x6
* Kb Swings 4x13
* Sumo Front squat 3x10

"Hey everyone, I wanted to know if you guys had any input on specific variables to input on this app I am working on to predict when your muscles will be sore so it can suggest what muscle to work on for the day, and potentially which muscle you will be working on the following week.

Current I have are:  


Time Worked Out (Minutes/Hours), Muscle Targeted (Categorize by Pullups, Dips, Pushups or actual Muscle?), Day of the week (Mon-Fri), Volume of Workout (Sets), Average RPE Per Set, Meals ate during the day (0-5), Protein in Each Meal (1-5 Scale...?) , etc

Essentially you would record about a week or more of your own data for these fields (and more) and it would forecast your future weeks based on that data.

I don't want you guys to have to do too much work to get a result, so I want to ask what you guys would like to input in order to make it fun as well and not as taxing as inputting calories daily on MyFitnessPal.

&#x200B;

I did think about doing a version where you input total calories for the day with macros to get a more accurate prediction, but for now, I want to work on the basic version for all users.

The end goal is to have all of us training athletes whether its for fun to be able to wake up and have the machine tell us what to do, and what is best for our body based on many calculations and inputs, and after each workout we simply and basically input what we did in an easy matter daily and the predictions get better over time.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hey all, first post here. I’m 28, male, and back in uni I was relatively active, cycling every day + doing MMA and random calisthenics for 5-6 days/wk. 

I went into maintenance mode after uni but restarted again, being consistent with the RR 3x/wk for the past 1+ years. Gained 10kg off mostly muscle and got noticeably bigger + stronger.

I deloaded for the last two weeks of 2021 and fell sick in the first week of 2022. Lost 6kg and now it takes me double the time to finish the same RR workout I did before my deload, and I feel way more exhausted. Feels like I’m back in square one, and feels like my goals (OAP/HSPU) are getting further and further.

Sometimes I look at fitness celebrities who are way older and I think, why can’t I be like that? Why does it feel like I take two steps forward and two steps back? What’s their secret?

For context, I’m also expecting my first child soon and I’ve been working two jobs for the past month which has drained my energy. But I constantly feel like I’m just making excuses for myself, instead of working hard.

To anyone who has made it past similar circumstances, how did you overcome? What was your mindset like moving into each workout? How did you cope with the new responsibilities?

"https://i.imgur.com/3VlIPRa.png

I can only get my brain around ""shoulder below hands"" type of hanging. That's the type of thing I'm used to doing with chins and pullups.

I guess I'm not understanding ""why don't the hands spin around the bar"" when arms are at the angle this guy's are in the pics. Maybe I'm being low-IQ about physics or something?

As best I can think of this, by leaning backwards your center-of-mass is no longer ""below"" your shoulders so where they go wouldn't matter, and it does look like his navel is underneath the bar.

So in theory maybe you don't need to grip the bar at all (ie just bend the first knuckle but not the rest?) to create anti-rotation? Like one of those ""no hands pull"" wrist monstrosities but not quite so extreme?

But the stress is clearly different on the lats in some way because of the angle of the torso and I guess the leverage on the lats?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Normally I did weight training 3-4 days a week. But the lockdown started again in my country, and the fitness closed, so I tried bodyweight training. I followed the recommended routine from this sub. For the upper body, I think the volume is enough to maintain and develop muscle. But for the lower body, I feel like the volume is not enough to maintain my muscle. I do beginner shrimp squat and single leg hamstring slide.  I feel the current progression is too easy, but my mobility and coordination is not good enough to do the next progression. Should I increase the rep or set from 3X5-8 or keep doing this until I am good enough for the next progression?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I  recently started the Recommended Routine to try to get stronger, which has been cool. I'm still super weak and on the first or second  progression of most of the exercises, but it's been cool to try.

I was  thinking I could replace one of the 3 weekly RR workouts with a gym  workout — but can anyone recommend a routine that would work similar  muscles to a similar degree? I'm not that experienced with gym equipment, so I'm not sure how to go about building a routine.

" I’m an 18 year old male who has a poor diet and a “normal body” but I want to do more. Where do I start?

Is it with food? If so, there is a lot of powders and stuff but I know that some just don’t work, which would I stay away from which should I use now etc? 
Also what foods should I eat // avoid

Does it start with weights? I have weights but I tried one time but I didn’t notice a difference I think I was doing something wrong. 

How long before I will start to notice improvements? (Even if it’s just very little by little)

Notice: I have my own gym with pretty much everything you could think of besides a pull-up bar. (I have something kinda similar but it’s a machine you sit on and pull up -idk the name) 

What machines should I use / avoid 

NOTICE: it would be great to look amazing and ripped but in general I just want my body to start slowly looking better and I want to feel more healthy 

Edit: Also, is it better to do more weight and less reps or less weight and more reps? /// Aka more reps or more weight?

"As a bodyweight workout person myself, I've been using a cheap pull-up bar I bought from a local store. It's the kind where you put it on your door frame (no drilling needed). It was all good at the beginning, but the fact that it took the paint off the wall (bye bye, deposit!) after a couple of uses left a bitter taste in my mouth. I also found it to be a bit limited in usability - apart from wide-grip and close-grip pull-ups it's not really usable for much else (hence the name I guess!)

That got me thinking about what the perfect pull-up bar would be. I'm reaching out to this group as it seems to be the right place for pull-up bar users. I'd greatly appreciate your input on my questions below!

* What do you look for in a pull-up bar (e.g. price, portability, attaching accessories, durability, no drilling, etc.)?
* What common problems/pitfalls do pull-up bars have?
* What pull-up bar are you using?
* If you could change one thing about it, what would it be?

"17M, in college and upcoming quarter because I am getting into in person learning so I’ll have access to a full gym since in person. Been doing the following for the past 6 months

* 50 PPUs
* 30 minutes of jump rope (past 2 months)
* 25 pull ups
* 25 chin ups I worked out 5 days a week at home

Obviously I’ve been focusing too much on my upper body since I’ve been stuck at home doing hybrid.

Any routine suggestions for cutting? I am already average weight for my height and I wanna cut more and define my abs further, and obviously do leg day. My routine I’ve came up with is

* 25 pull ups
* 25 chin ups
* leg raises on pull up bar
* squats (5x3)
* 30 minutes on stair master
* 30 minute jog
* front lever (still learning this)

I’ve signed up for kickboxing aerobics, I am probably overloading myself?

I’ll be doing this routine 4 days a week since I have class 4 days a week.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey so I'm pretty fucking confused. I just had a DEXAScan in a cheap hospital in a South American country.  The cost was around 40 dollars and the machine seemed really slow and they said I was too tall for the full body scan but eventually I did it anyway and they scanned everything except my feet to make up for that.

To get to the point I'm 30 y/o male under 21 BMI so around 20 BMI and it said I had 23.6% body fat and that my legs were 56% bodyfat. I have had a break from the gym that was pretty long but have gotten back and been working out 4-5 days a week the last 3 months and eaten lots of protein.

My first thought was, is it even possible to have 20 BMI (near underweight) with close to obese body fat? Mind that I have a super marked inwards going waist line, well defined face showing clearly all cheek bones, 4 pack visible when flexing my abs.

Sure I'm not super strong but I lift more than the average person my age and wtf Im like 20 BMI, for 5-8 reps max I can do the following: 30 kg per dumbell in dumbell bench press, 15-16 kg dumbells biceps curls, 6-7 wide grip pull ups going down to straight arms, 18-20 kg dumbell shoulder press.

Legs are a bit weaker where I only use 50 kg for squatting good form 6-8 reps so having higher bodyfat legs could make sense but 56% sounds a bit extreme on my BMI no?

When questioning this result some of their doctors tried to say that this is completely normal? That part is the most confusing one.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"So heres the problem, in 2019 i lost 13 kgs, and wasn't doing muscle building exercises, just body weight stuff like pushup squats etc, i was following an extremely low calorie intake diet, which made me hate food. Then i threw away the diet and i was happy and nit gaining weight, i was happily at the 82-84kg range for 2020, and then at 2021 at September, I got a new scale and it measured 87kg. I started lifting weights and building some muscle with a dumbell and barbell set i bought during quarantine.

Now i love weight lifting, and go to the gym but i also wanna lose weight. Even though i am eating less my weight isn't dropping consistently. Is it because i am building more muscle so the changes dont appear on the scale. I usually measure at morning with an empty stomach. I do upper and lower body splits 4 times a week, and all of the exercises are to build muscles. I am really confused, shouldn't i be losing at least some weight in a week or two.

TLDR:my weight isn't dropping despite eating less, is it due to me weightlifting in a muscle building fashio","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Looking for a solution to a problem I’ve run into trying to do pull-ups at home. 

So I bought a pull-up bar, the kind that hangs on a door, and it turns out all the doors in my apartment are either too wide, or in a corner where the bar won’t hang straight. On top of this, none of the doors have casing so a wider bar (if they make them) would slide around on the wall and be completely useless/unsafe. 
So my question: is there anything I can do at home other than build a pull-up bar tower, or buy one (asking because neither of these are really an option.  Apartment is small, and I don’t have a ton of money sitting around to buy something).

"I'm trying to get my first proper pull up (never done one). I tried to improve my incline rows (as regression), trained for a month and doubled my max (now 22).  
I noticed while I still can't do a pull up from a dead hang, if my elbows are bent about 30 degrees I can complete the rest of the movement (door pullup bar is low so my feet can touch).  
Now to progress from here, I've thought of:

1. continuing with incline rows
2. doing pullup reps starting with my elbows bent about 30 degrees
3. buying some resistance bands and try to lift myself up from a dead hang

I've already tried scapular pulls and negative pullups but I don't really feel they work for me (dislike the movement and find myself being inconsistent while training them).

"*Routine* 

Hi, I have many doubts if I am making thinks good.  
Here is my currently routine that I have being doing for a almost a month:  


Being in a Diet with calorie deficit, eating more proteins, fruits and veggies and less carbs.   
Start exercising around 5:30 am with low body impact high intensity from TBP. I breakfast around 6:30 am.  
So far so God, Have lost weight and I don't fell bad physically.  


I started reading online that If you work out before eating, especially in the morning, you start to lose muscles, which is something that I don´t want. I am 26 years old, 1.86 cm height and right now My weight is 300 Lbs (Started at 330 lbs around 2 months ago) My nutritionist encourage me to go around 230 Lbs to have a safe weight  


I now Want to try doing HIIT CARDIO, I tried one session (avoiding 2 exercise in danger of hurting my self, But I only have time to doing exercise in the morning.  


For me working out in the morning is the best time for me because I have nothing to do beside eating and preparing m self to go to work, when I come back from Work my rest of the day is busy in family matters (Married man who loves to share with family)   


Any Advice?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Upon my training lately, I've been reading this book called Over Coming Gravity Second Edition by Steven Low. I'm really enjoying the the in depth details of the book. When it comes to training, having a plan is highly important. Although I gained some strength and muscle, I also went through a lot of trial and error because I didn't have a plan. I was very random with it. Taking information from various sources, articles, websites and people. For sure a lot of the information was very useful, I still was all over the place. Didn't know if I wanted, size, strength, endurance, power, or callisthenic skills. So the best advice I can give to new comers or people who are already into calisthenics or fitness in general is to have a vision. Then have a plan of how to execute that vision. What will it take to get there?\*

1. Whats your goal? Skills, mass, more reps, strength, endurance, shredded physique, etc etc\*
2. What type of training? Certain type of reps and sets will get you there! \*
3. What equipment do I need? Rings, p bars, agility ladder, etc etc\*
4. Nutrition, rest, timing, and place of training. 

All of these very per person as we all have different lifestyles. Find what works for you. 

If I were to start over. I would purchase a book in the beginning or someone else program just so I don't have to do the manual work of figuring out what to do.

Hope this help. Happy Friday

"I'm a 5'3 , 137 lbs female. I've always focused on lifting as heavy as possible when working out, so I've always had a pretty muscular physique.

"Latest handstand clocked in at about 21 seconds. Saw a lot of progress in November after consistent practice in-between my work schedule. Still can't believe that I started in July which makes me curious to see what next year brings

For me, each day of practicing handstands is different. Some days have bigger victories where I can have longer holds, and some days I'm more tired and have to remind myself to keep the mentality of ""quality of quantity"" while celebrating a few shorter holds. I also find it important to take breaks on some days to recover arm strength, but consistency is key. I only started in July, but was able to see more progress with the help of a personal coach at my local circus school who specializes in many different acrobatic arts including handbalancing. I could only hold a balancer of about 2-3 seconds without the wall in the beginning, but a few months later, my longest hold is 21 second. But it's far from consistent. I can maybe get good form holds every 2 in 10 kick ups at the moment, but it's a process that I try to make enjoyable by celebrating the small victories, even if it's just one or two good holds per session

What was your mentality when it came to learning handstands? Any tips/suggestions are always welcomed

"28 M trying to learn the elbow lever. Every time I attempt my elbows slip out from under me.

"I’m trying to improve push ups but I’m not sure if I’m doing the sets right. I can do standard push ups but lack of endurance dictates I can do no more than 12 before I hit muscle failure, and that’s only on the first set. I hit failure earlier on subsequent sets. Due to this, I have started doing knee push ups to increase reps and thus, hopefully, endurance. But I’m really not sure if I’m going about it correctly. 

Because everywhere I look recommends rep based training, I make my goal in each workout to hit a certain number of reps with each set (more is better, right?). So for knee push ups, my goal is three sets of 25, but because I can only do about 17 before muscle failure (on the first set), a “set” usually involves doing push ups until muscle failure, taking a brief break, then pushing to failure again until I hit the desired reps. Then I do it again on the next set after I get through the other exercises.

The pain continues in a few accessories as well like weighted dips, weighted pull ups, OHP. Other than these the pain goes away I can’t feel anything while doing hammer or anything else.

1. Does front lever carry over to sports performance better than pull ups? Or vice versa

2. Is it counter productive to train both pull ups and doing front lever at the same time? Can I improve front lever doing pull ups 90% at the time, and only 10% front lever spesific training for example? 

3. Is there any other exercises that have the same benefits as the front lever when it comes to building back and core muscles, but is less fatiguing? 

4. Lastly, what do you think of this exercise: https://m.youtube.com/shorts/bc-ZJ-yMfZo","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
" When activating your core, not only do you suck your navel to your spine, but are you also supposed to flex and tighten down your abs after this motion or should I just keep my navel sucked in tight to my spine?

That muscle on the inside of my thighs - I want to mobilize it further. Can anyone recommend a solid movement or two to improve my mobility there? 

I've found that it's holding back my squat form and giving me some back issues because my back starts to bend rather than my hips opening up.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"To start off, let me know if this borders too close on asking for medical advice, but I am not having any particular current issues with pain or anything and am more just wondering about body mechanics and the possible implications.

I was born with bilateral club feet and had surgery as a baby so that my feet and ankles look pretty much normal, except my ankles are limited in that I can't bend them dorsiflexion-wise (idk how to say that), as in pointing my toes up at me, past 90 degrees. My platar flexion is not great but I'm not just locked at 90. 

What this means is that it is impossible for my heels to stay on the ground while performing a squat. There is no amount of stretching I can do to improve this, it's how the bones are structured that blocks my ROM in that direction so this is what I'm stuck with unless I go through a very long surgery and recovery.

Now for my actual question: does anyone have any idea how this effects my squats mechanically and anything I should potentially modify or watch out for? I have seen people use/recommend putting something under your heels. Is this actually advantageous beyond the balance? Are there any issues with it?

The only thing I have concluded so far are that I need to work on balance because squatting forces me onto the balls of my feet so I have a much smaller platform than most to work with. Also, for reference, I can do a single pistol squat on each leg, although inconsistently due to the difficulty in balancing, so don't think that I am a lost cause, since I have made a lot of progress already despite my issue.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Is there some cue I'm missing that could cause this pain? I've been doing calisthenics for 4 months, mainly focusing on the basics and not rushing things too quickly and doing some light skill work here and there.

"My RHR has increased from 61bpm to 65 bpm since 10 days ago (Dec 16). It even went to 66 one day. This is very abnormal for me as my RHRs were very stable for a year (average was 59-60 bpm).

One thing I can think of is overtraining. I started weight lifting on Nov 20 and increased intensity gradually. I do it 30 mins a day everyday. I don’t have a rest day. And I did constantly feel muscle sore. I did some research and found overtraining could be a reason. So I stopped my training for 3 days but my RHR is still 65 bpm today.

I also learned increased muscle mass might be a reason but there wasn't too much scientific study about it. My weight increased 3kg in the past month, which is very significant.

Has anyone experienced this? Or could it be Fitbit’s software update? Would like to share your thoughts. Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Sorry I know my situation isn’t exactly about body weight, but just trying to ask around everywhere and I think it’s still very relevant 

 Probably just an overreaction from a first timer, but thought I should ask anyways. 

Worked out at the first time at a gym 2 days ago, and really pushed myself to the limits with sets/reps. I woke up the next day sore, but nothing crazy, kind of what I expected. And since I’m running a PPL routine, I thought I wouldn’t need to rest since pull day only made my biceps, forearm and back sore. However the next dat for push day, since my grip strength is quite weak or my form was incorrect any dumbbell activities (like shoulder press or lateral raises)  meant to target triceps/chest/shoulders ended up working out my biceps and forearms, which I recognized but didn’t think much of since I didn’t feel any pain. However I woke up today with severe forearm and bicep soreness, 10x more then I felt when I actually worked them out 2 days ago. And the strangest part is the muscles I actually targeted for push day weren’t sore at all, only the forearm and bicep. It’s to the point where I have to hold my arms at 90 degrees or feel pain. I understand what DOMS is, I just never knew it could happen in a scenario like this, and to this extent. I haven’t had any dark urine so I don’t think it’s rhabdo, but thought I should get a second opinion anyways since I know it can occur from extreme overexertion especially in beginners.

Thanks alot","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So I do my standard workout routine every other day. Nothing crazy: planche and l-sit training, some weighted squats, pull-ups, push-ups,....

But I'm looking for a everyday routine parrallel to this, which I can do on rest and training days. I do some HIIT in the morning with burpees and some pure bodyweight squats and I don't feel this interferes with my general training, but would it hurt if I for example do something like maximum pushups until failure every night before going to bed? Because I really like doing that to get my max number up, but I don't know if this interferes with my training? Maybe I should only be doing that the night before rest days? What do you guys think.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm curious about this. My daughter, who is 9 and can do everything, was sitting in what I would call a butt down (but off the ground) reverse table top position, and to stand up she kind of moved her bodyweight over her feet, into a deep squat, and then stood up.

I have very limited dorsiflexion due to an ankle fracture that is not going to improve, but I tried it anyway and... I can't even come close. it feels like my body is like actively pushing me back but it doesn't feel like it is just the ankle. 

I'd like to get this exercise down so I tried using a rope and kind of pulling myself into a deep squat. Curious if anyone has any other ideas of intermediate stuff I could add to develop the skill?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely adore this routine. Ever since I started doing it 5 months ago I've gained a good amount of muscle and burned some of the fat I gained from sitting on my ass for all of last year.

Initially, I had planned to finish all of the workouts from the RR in the progressive workouts app and then move on to something else. The problem is that a friend of mine who has been working out for 4 years now said that it'll take me a few years or so to reach something as hard as tuck front levers (I'm currently doing 3 sets of 7 horizontal rows) because my rate of progress will slow down once I start getting to the harder ones

So basically my main question is, is it fine if I stick with the RR? I find it very convenient to do but from what I've read it's a routine that's just to get you to dip your feet into fitness. I just don't know how deep you're supposed to go with it","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I am 17 years old, 168cm tall and weigh 60kg.

Prior to doing Maltese and Nakayama I had 10 second cross on rings, 3-4 cross presses and 10 second planche on floor. The Maltese took me around 3 weeks of training to do, and the Nakayama I got it on my third attempt without training.

"So far nothing works for my dips. 


As far as pushing is concerned I can do: 

- 16 push ups, 
- 12 D-push ups, 
- 30 seconds support hold on rings, 
- 12 bench or chair dips. 
- not a single parallel bar dip



It's not even close to getting one, I seem to be unable to lower more than a few inches without fear of ripping my triceps apart. 



I often ride a century ride on a road bike with a very aero forward aggressive stance which puts a lot of load on triceps, about one third of my weight. And I am able to ride 4-5 hours like that. 



How in the world I can't do a single dip is beyond me. Very demotivating. 


I did a month worth of workouts assisting with legs, and it seems to be almost there with how little assistance I need, and yet - no go. 



Any help with this would be greatly appreciated?


EDIT: I just tried some with my feet on the scale to see how much assistance I need. 




Negative assist is about 7 Lbs and to push up about 20-25 Lbs.

- Tuck jump up to tuck handstand
- Freestanding HSPU
- Frogstand to Handstand

I started doing the BWF primer routine around may, and the RR around august. Before that I was in my worst form ever (82kg with very high bf) and decided it was time to change. I've put in everything: a healthy diet with the advice of a specialist, 2-3 weekly workouts, PT to prevent injuries, and recently I also included daily creatine and protein shakes post workout.

Every change has been hard from the beginning, my entire body has hurt, and I'm still struggling to work out consistently, but today every effort has paid off. Now I'm 71kg, stronger than ever in my life and improving daily. I'm happy af! And the best thing is that I've shown my kids what you can get with effort and consistency.

"Hello all,  
I started calisthenics a few months ago, and my exercises are time based.  
I have:  
6 different exercises  
40 sec activity, followed by 20 sec rest  
Repeating it 4 times.  
  
However I can't find any document, description, anything if time based exercises make sense in calisthenics or the best is going with reps.  
Of course, at the last round I can't do as much reps in the 40 sec as in the beginning (paying attention for the form and movement), but I think it's expected and OK.  
So my question is: what do you think about time based training? Does it worth the effort to keep up for a longer period of time or it's just wasting energy?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I did this in 6 months, with a bad routine.

Looking back at my older pictures, I was fatter. 

This is considered borderline overweight and I wanna lose weight so much.

My previous routine was 25 chin ups, 25 pull ups, and 50 PPUs

I’ve been in lockdown and the past 3 years I’ve gained 40 pounds. 

My new routine is this:  

- sumo squat 5x3
- jog 30 min
- 5x4 shoulder press 
- Cable curls 5x4
- chin ups 5x2 
- pull ups 5x2 
- Leg press 5x4
- Pec fly 5x4
- Plank 1-2 min 

I want to train for aesthetics, and I don’t know much about lifting. I’ve been told that these groupings are for strength training. 

I know my maintenance, deficit, and surplus calories and besides the obvious cardio, what are other methods of losing belly fat?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Right now when I do my 3 set of squats in my workout I do one set of assisted pistol squats (by holding onto something with both hands, ~14 reps per leg), one set where I hold with just one hand (~7 reps per leg) and one set of assisted  intermediate shrimp squats where I hold with just one hand (~10 reps per leg). 

I don't have this problem with any other of the 5 progressions. But squats exhaust me way too much if I get close to failure. I run out of breath and most often I have to take way longer breaks. In days where I get exhausted more easily for whatever reason if I keep going 0-1-2 reps from failure with squat progressions I almost feel like I have an asthma attack and I have to rest for 5-7 minutes until I get to the workout again. Whatever I do, I either am far from going to failure or I take very long breaks, which both interfere with hypertrophy. Is there a way to get around this?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am 16M.

I have been doing pushups for over a year now and my max rep is about 50 with proper form and all. I normally do them in sets of 20-25, and do about 200-250 a night. I sometimes have rest days. I had rapid muscle progression in the first couple months (I have stretch marks on shoulders and biceps to prove that) but ever since I feel like nothing is happening definition wise.

What progression pushups would be helpful. I think I might have a slight imbalance as I have much bigger triceps than biceps, but after doing some bicep barbell curls I have sort of fixed that. So what progression pushups could I do, ideally without any equipment. I've seen people recommend diamond pushups (but that might target the triceps too much again) or pseudo pushups. Just wondering what is the most beneficial pushup progression that impacts triceps, biceps and shoulders.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

First time posting here. I’ve been working out at my own pace for years, and I like hitting the gym at least 3x weekly. Recently got into HIIT workouts using mostly body weight.

I’ve never addressed this issue formally because I thought this was a “me” problem and that I’d get over it eventually. Just finished a HIIT workout and noticed just how awful my feet hurt when doing squats or really any exercise that requires me to stand on my feet for prolonged periods of time. This happens regardless of the types of shoes I wear. I will say I haven’t tried any feet pads or anything like Dr. Scholl’s. 

Does this mean my feet muscles are inherently weak and that I need to strengthen them somehow? If so, what are some exercises I can do? If not, how can I fix this issue? I like calisthenics and body weight exercises because they are so effective, but I’m worried that this issue will detract me from wanting to do these workouts in the future.

"I have been doing callisthenics for a long while now. Until now I have been focusing on the hypertrophy rep range, honestly because I was a skinny-fat runt most of my life.

However, now I have seen some decent results, I've reached some more advanced progressions on some exercises and honestly... I don't feel like going for even harder progressions in some cases. There are some exercises that I just like, that feel good, that feel like the best bang for my buck or because further progressions feel overcomplicated. I was thinking in that case about just increasing the amount of reps in a set as a way of progressing. Also, I'd like to work on my strength-endurance and work capacity more, not just max strength and hypertrophy.

However, while I am OK with not making any more gains, I wouldn't want to loose too much of what I've already built. The question is - would going more into the endurance range *on exercises that I am already doing* lead to loss of muscle mass? Or just slower/no gains?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"So I’ve been considering switching from traditional weight lifting to calisthenics. I’ve been lifting for about 10 years (27 yo, 6’4, 215) and have kind of fallen in love with the idea of how calisthenics allows you to really take control of your body and movements. 

I’ve done the RR before and didn’t really feel… challenged or like I was progressing I guess is the right word. Push-ups, dips, pull-ups are easy, until you obviously get into your more advanced variations but I didn’t understand how to keep progressing when I couldn’t get certain movements or how to incorporate skills into it.

"Hello everybody!

Just a few basic details about me:

Age: 19
Sex: Male
Height: 168 cm (5'6)
Weight: 66-69 kgs (mostly fat mass and not toned muscle mass)

So, I started exercising 2 days ago, I know I have started off quite late, but I still want to get flexible.

So my long term aims are: 
1) Develop my flexibility, endurance, cardio, fat loss, power and stamina

2) Be flexible and have enough of endurance to perform flips, backflips, rolls, hand stands (are these goals unrealistic?)

3) I am hoping to start figure skating as well, so flexibility exercises which will help me for that as well.

On Nov 9, I tried doing basic warm ups like stretching, forward and back bends, squats, etc. But now since 2 days my body is so darn sore (especially my legs: my hamstring and calf muscles) and also my waist area. What did I do wrong? Perhaps I should start with 'loosening' up my body.

If anybody can offer this new comer some advice, I wouls truly be greatful! Video recommendations or information sources would even be better!

P.S.: I am a broke student who cannot afford gym membership or any fancy equipment, please suggest accordingly :'(

My question is -  at what point do you say ""well, my ankles are just built this way"" and sort of give up with trying? It's difficult to explain but when I try doing these exercises to address the issue it doesn't feel like when I try to stretch my hamstrings (not quite painful but not exactly pleasant, but progress feels ""possible""), but when I try to do anything to help with ankle mobility it feels like I'm hitting against this wall of impossibility almost immediately.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've always had trouble making gains from exercise, but this level of regression is new even for me.

Background: 40M and thin. I did some GTG chin-ups earlier this year, getting to 5 max. Then I mostly stopped working out for half a year, until picking up kettlebells a couple months ago.

Two weeks ago, I got back to chin-ups, maxing out at 3 reps. Which was better than during my break, so the kettlebells must've helped here.

I did one day of 6 sets of 10 reps, where first set was 3 chinups + 7 negatives, and the remaining sets all negatives. 2 minute rests in between sets, and that was it for the day. Muscles were ANNIHILATED, which felt great! And sore for days. Behind my armpit (teres major?) the muscle was visibly super swollen quite a while, so I just gave it some rest, stretches and sauna.

However, despite 10 days of rest (with some active rest like jump rope and one round of kettlebells) as well as tons of protein and calories in the meanwhile, I couldn't get a single chin-up.

Gave it a few more days, and still the same story - first chin-up gets stuck halfway through.

Please tell me what exactly happened to my muscles here and what should I be doing instead, because this obviously isn't working.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello guys, and a happy new year to everyone. 

So I’m just posting about help with mobility. Since I started Calisthenics, I’ve noticed I have very poor mobility, which has probably lead to some injuries. For example, I cannot for the life of me sit in deep squat due to poor ankle mobility. When I do the 5 inch wall test, my knee is probably about 2 inches away from touching the wall - basically need another 2inches of ankle mobility. In general I’m a stiff person, especially in my lower body. I play quite a bit of soccer, and I have noticed that I really struggle to hit high volleys (Zidane 2002 UCL final) cause of tight hips, and I really struggle with the L-sit cause of poor compression and possibly tight and weak hip flexors.

So I was wondering, are there any good mobility programs out there that you would recommend. I know there are channels like Tom Merrick on YouTube, but there is so much information out there that it’s a struggle to colate all of it and create a program that can help me. There’s even the kneesovertoes guy who’s program I’ve heard is good at helping people gain lower body mobility and strength.

All opinions/help is welcomed. And I hope you all have a great 2022 in regards to your fitness journey","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So im doing p90x (havent worked out in a year and a half, almost 2 years). On the shoulders/arms day the last excerise is a tricep side rise and I stuggled doing even one, when I did more then one my legs were not in the  right postion (top leg was draped over bottom leg and top foot touching floor. When my legs were in the right postion and I could do a couple it was only because my elbows were slighlty modified  (elbow of arm grasping shoulder was out and in front of arm pushing up, instead of behind)

Is it ok to modify the postion until I can do it properly. The big thing I was having trouble with is where the plam of my pushing arm should be placed in relation to the shoulder on the floor and my head.

"Hello people,

I am 25 years old, 180cm, and 82kg heavy and I went to the gym in the past and also did a little bit of bodyweight training, but did not really work out with a proper plan and goals. Currently, I am able to do maybe 2 pullups and dips and hold 5s of Lsit.

I have read overcoming gravity by steven low and started to set some goals I want to achieve in training:

1) Free Handstand Pushups  
2) Muscle Up  
3) One Arm Chinup  
4) Dragon Flag

\[ 5) Sixpack - I know its more diet-related but I want to achieve this for the next summer \]

As it will take probably a long time to achieve the goals, I wanted to ask you guys what are reasonable intermediate goals for this year (I would like to have a plan for the next 6months)? My suggestion: 

1) 3x8 Pullups  
2) 3x8 Parallel Bar Dips  
3) 3x8 RTO Pushups (Rings)  
4) 3x8 Archer Ring Rows (Rings)  
5) Handstand 1min against wall  
6) Lsit 30s (with Parallettes)

&#x200B;

I want to achieve my goals with  a full body workout 3x a week. I took Steven Lows Untrained Beginner Workout and modified it a little bit to make it a little bit shorter. 

1) 3x5-8 Handstands (5min practice)  
2) 3x5-8 Pull Up negatives  
3) 3x5-8 Dip negatives  
4) 3x5-8Ring Rows  
5) 3x5-8 Ring Pushups  
6) 3x8 Assisted Pistol Squat (as I lack mobility)  
7) 3x15 Jumping Squats  
8) 3 sets of Lsits  
9) 3x10 Bicep Curls  
10)  German Hangs

Does my workout plan reflect the goals I want to achieve or would you make some adjustments? 

I appreciate any kind of help. Thank you very much.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm planning to start training and progressing asymmetric pull ups in January (asym. pull ups --> archer top position hold --> typewriters --> archers). Before that I'm thinking about getting stronger in wide pull ups with holds to make it easier to progress in asymmetric pull ups. 

My idea was to use the fighter pull up programm on the wide pull ups with top hold. I would do this type of workout (5 sets, avoid failure, long rest between sets) 4 times a week. In addition, I would do my basic training once a week (pull and core in 1 day, push and legs in the following day). The basic training is there so I don't neglect other muscle groups.

Does this make any sense or should I rather do something else to strengthen my vertical pulling?

I know that ""more trained he person is, more training is necessary to evolve"", but 3 months in the same place is very bad.I'm posting here looking for suggestions,so please help me,I'll be very thankful.

Edit:Maybe the reason for I'm not evolving is that I always just do 3-6 rep and 6-12 sec hold,and nothing beyond that.Maybe my body is too adapted to strength training,and need new stimulus,like hypertrophy or endurance training.What do you guys think?Thanks a lot","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So, I asked a friend of mine who does a lot of bodyweight, to give me a weekly schedule which can, in theory, make me stronger, faster, and more agile for parkour and similar activities including jumping high, sprinting short distances, etc. and he gave me this one:

**DAY 1:**  

Tri-Set One: Push Ups(3x20)- Jumping Lunges(3x20)- L-Sit Hold(3x30”)

Tri-Set Two:Dips(3×15)-Hanging Knee Raises(3×15)-Half Burpees(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Chin Ups(3×10)-Sit Ups(3×20)-Glute Bridges(3×10)

**DAY 2:**

Tri-Set One: Wide to Close Push Ups(3×20)-Wide to Close Squats(3×20)-Supermans(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Tricep Extensions(3×12)-Reverse Crunches(3x20)-Inch Worms(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Pull Ups(3×10)-Toes to Bar(3×20)-Alternating Pistol Squats(3×10)

**DAY 3:**

Tri-Set One: Decline Push Ups(3×20)-Box Jumps(3×10)-Hollow Hold(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Plank to Push Ups(3×15)-Bicycle Crunches(3×30)-Flutter Kicks(3×50)

Tri-Set Three: Wide Grip Pull Ups(3×10)-Wall Climbs(3×20)-Plank Hold(3xFailure)

Each one of these days is accompanied by a warm up run (I plan on running 20-30'). In between these, he said I could either do endurance cardio, mobility or martial arts and keep it 5-6 days a week.

I want to know your opinion as well. 

Is it good in terms of specificity, or just a generic program he gave me, to get rid of me (possible scenario!) ? 

What changes can I do to make it better for my goal?

"I want to see what everyone’s opinions are on the front lever row for full range strength training, specifically scapular retraction.

I value the FL row due to its crossover to static FL and as a counterbalance to horizontal pushing work.

But recently as I’ve been working on fixing some postural issues (rounded shoulders, scapular winging, impingement) I’ve noticed how the FL row doesn’t allow full ROM (range of motion) because it is almost impossible to properly retract during the movement. 

My pull work pretty much revolves exclusively around FL work and chin-ups. But neither of these movements build scapular retraction (am I correct?). So does that mean that your average calisthenics push-pull program  (assuming mine is average) is not effectively balanced since it never allows for full scapular retraction training?

Would love to hear your thoughts?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi everyone ! 

I'm planning to loose some weight for the next month (I don't have much hope but I'll try anyway aha) and for this time I only have floor, rings and my beloved family countryside. I've made a light workout session that I could do 5/6 times a week that I plan to pair with a light 5/6k run. So I'm just not sure how to proceed with the routine. 

I know I want to execute right in the morning before eating anything but from there I don't know if I should go with the running session or the workout first. 
With the run, I'm really waked up and aware when I start the workout but I'm already out of gas and will struggle a bit in rep ranges I would not without the run. 
With the workout I'm in theory at maximal strength capacity but I'm very hard to ignite in the morning and it would be a struggle for like the first half of the workout and I also will breath heavy at a much lower pace in the run following. 

I think that's a workout I can do even with a run before, like for the ring pullups it's a 4 sets drop (15-14-13-12) where my max is around 4/3 of the biggest set (19~20reps) but I'm not sure about how the run could negate in a way the workout being right after.

I started doing 100 jumping jacks, 30 knee push-ups (too heavy right now), and 30 second plank whilst playing basketball, I started Tuesday and just got finished with my little workout. But during the past few days I've noticed a big change in my body. I didn't lose weight but my form is starting to come back. For the last few months I've grown taller and stayed the same weight from 2020 but up until a few months I looked out of shape. Thanks to playing football I gained a somewhat muscular form and the exercises have made me feel better. My calves have started to get harder and you're able to see the muscle outline of them, My arms are getting a little more toned and I'm able to jump higher. I've always been able to do planks but now I feel as if my stomach has gotten tighter. And I look good in hoodies now.

"Hey folks. I am just starting out in a bodyweight strength routine. My reasons for training are basically down to physical health, aesthetic purposes, and job functionality(want to go into law enforcement and getting into Kajukenbo and BJJ). Not get bulky, but have a lean build with decent strength.

That said, it has taken a while to get a solid routine going. Procrastination aside, part of it is that being autistic it is easy for me to overthink/analyze things. Like, in terms of whether to split muscle groups, full body or push/pull/legs, use weights at the gym or resistance bands. But at this juncture I just want to settle for bodyweight for simplicity, and also Iroh;)

The routine I'll be starting seems to be good for these purposes(may modify exercises/add reps as time goes on) and will do this 3 times a week with days of running inbetween (done in sets of 3, NOT circuit style):

10 Push Ups

12 Deadbugs

15 Squats

10 Doorway Curls

30 Second Plank

10 Narrow Push Ups

30 Second Sumo Pulses

10 TRX Rows

I wanna train for 5 days because I wanna get the maximum strength and muscle gains while resting on the off days.

Also, what are work sets? Can someone enlighten me? My main language is not English and I'm confused as I only know about sets.

"So I read the FAQ on how to find the amount of food I should be eating, followed it to r/gainit where I used this [calculator](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/tools/bmr-calculator) to estimate the calories to maintain my current weight.

For context I'm 6'4"", 161Lbs, male, trying to gain mass (my goal is to reach 200Lbs in a year). and the calculator estimated I should be eating around 2444 calories to maintain my weight if I am somewhere between sedentary and light workout (which is true, I work 10-15 hours a week at a sales job, otherwise I'm not active with the exception of  
hiking once a month) 

I also calculated how much food I was eating for a few days and found that it only took 1995 calories on average to stay between 160-163Lbs during the week so I'm not sure there was a mistake on my part, if the calculate was wrong, or if I just have a unique body.

I also wanted to find the calories burned from the recommended routine so I can implement that into my diet, but the FAQ said to listen to your calculator (which I was having trouble with already) and I'm not sure how intense of a workout I should consider the routine (if I were to do it 4 times a week) for the calculator since I'm still a newbie to fitness in general.

"So I've been hitting the rings pretty hard every single morning. I'm wondering if doing such an intense workout every single day is damaging, or in any way harmful?

And while I don't feel anything specifically wrong, and I try to properly warmup and stretch, I don't want to put too much strain on anything and run into an injury.

I usually do 3 or 4 different exercises, relatively intermediate or advanced. Straight leg pull-ups, front lever work, iron cross work, archer pushups, etc. 3 sets of 8-10 reps. I do a light warmup before, including handstand work, and usually a light stretch at the end of the day, although sometimes I miss that one.

"Greetings!

Typically Reddit is just a place to rouse my curiosity, but this morning after viewing Tinder and seeing some guy do a plank in the air sort of thing, I felt inspire to be more fit.

The story:

I have been fit before, but right before covid I broke up with someone I was going to the gym with, and had a hard time motivation myself to get back in. I finally found a hot yoga studio I really liked, but then the world shut down, and my hot yoga along with it.

Fast forward to now:

Nearly 3 years later, and my at home weight set is basically collecting dust. I have plenty of fitness equipment available, I have just been sedentary for too long. (Sedentary, well, not completely. I walk plenty, albeit it's winter in Chicago right now and going outside is pretty dismal for just about anything.)

I wanted to get started with a suuuuper beginner bodyweight program, but don't know where to look. (Wether it be studios in my city, or something I can do at home.)

The skinny: Past inguinal hernia, scoliosis of the lower lumbar spine, pretty tight legs, weak wrists and forearms.

I really want to help myself, but feel like anything bearing weight on my wrists will hurt me. 

I was just looking for some type of guidance tailored to my needs. A roadmap, if you will, to point me in the right direction.

"So I have been looking into upper traps release and stretches and the top recommendations on Youtube did nothing for me. I found a video someone linked here on reddit of someone doing a deep traps release by doing a wall handstand and supporting one side of his traps on a foam roller. It looked awesome, but as a beginner working on shoulder health and stability even trying a handstand seems a little too daring for me at the moment. So I was looking into alternatives and a came up with a simple method: find a wall [corner](https://www.123rf.com/photo_21691246_background-of-the-white-brick-wall-corner.html), get on all fours, gently press your traps on the corner and then bend over while maintaining your hip high to control the pressure and the release area. After doing that I felt an instant relief on my traps. See if it does anything for you. If you have a better method please share.

Usually I do this workout at the beginning of my chest day, then follow by some bench press and tricep movement(8-12reps)

"Hey guys! First let me give you the data about myself, i'm a 24yo M , 174cm (5'8) and 65kg(143lb). When i started BWF , about 1,5/2 years ago i weighted 207lb(94kg), and after reading a lot about BWF and found the RR i was hooked.  


Current PR's:   


* 12 Full ROM Pullups
* 10 Ring Dips
* 5 Handstand Pushups Chest Against the Wall
* Full Back Lever
* 1 Ring Muscle Up (hardly correct form xD)
* 6 Full ROM Pistols

My current physique: [https://ibb.co/album/kHqBqj](https://ibb.co/album/kHqBqj)

Now i dont know what to do, neither with my routine (being that i dont progress as well with the RR),neither with my diet. I got down to 64/65kg and maintaining for aprox 6months now. I'm kinda afraid to bulk  and end up just being fat after all this work, and i'm not quite sure if i'm still too high in bodyfat to even begin a bulk.

Edit: GOALS : 

 Skills:freestanding handstand push up (I have a solid 10s handstand ) and a full front lever. 

I would certainly like to build a little more muscle aswell . 

Can you guys help a brother out ? Thank you all in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi guys, I’m currently training for the one arm push up with the correct form. At the moment my routine consists of:

3 X 10 (each arm) archer push ups 
3 X 12 decline push ups
3 X12 diamond push ups  

In that order. I’m wondering what exercise to progress to next? I’m reaching the 12 rep mark for each set and soon they will become somewhat easy. I still want to keep the majority of these exercises in my routine though as easier exercises after the main progression. I hope that makes sense. Also, everywhere I look online there seems to be differing advice on how to get the arm push up and what progressions to use. So I’m looking for the simplest route from where I’m at currently. 

Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I’ve been on the longest journey trying to learn how to do a push up. M 6’4”, 245 lbs. I lost nearly 100lbs in the past year with body weight exercises, Kettle Bell work, and Running. I’m training for an upcoming agility exam, and I still can’t do push ups.

A few weeks ago, I was able to do my first full good form push up without kneeling. I can do two, maybe 3 in a row. I have about 4 months to do 30 for my fitness test.

To train, I’ve been trying GTG by doing a single push up several times throughout the day. And 4x a week when at the gym, I do Push up negatives then knee push ups. I feel as though I’m not progressing much. When I was about 50lb heavier, I just assumed fat guys can’t do push ups. Now that I’m getting closer to my goal weight, and still struggling, I’m hoping someone has a suggestion.

Would Dumbbell press or Bench Press help my push ups? Or should I just increase volume of what I’m doing now? I really feel as though I’m the only one struggling with this movement, it seems so basic but so unattainable.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Does anyone have any experience with their (Rapid Primal Fitness)RPF-4 program?  It’s been all over the social media lately and I hate to say it but the adds are working on me and now I’m interested. (Maybe I just clicked it once the 1st time and FB won’t let it go. 

What appeals to me is it got a fitness program that tackles posture and flexibility on top body weight exercises.  I think it’s got nutrition in there.  The fact that it doesn’t use any equipment fits the bill as well. 

It’s only $37 at the moment.  It doesn’t seem like much to lose if it’s junk but I’m still cheap and don’t like to just give out money. 

Still it’s a FB add and the website has that gimmicky feel.  It promises the world at $xx.99 value for 1 cheap price. 

So I’m looking for reviews or someones experience.  There’s not a lot of legit sounding reviews on the internet.  Reddit searches only come up to their parkour stuff. 

I like the program with everything laid out for you.  I’m having a hard time getting started staying going on my own.  There’s too much info and I’m getting lost in the research about body weight, nutrition, flexibility, posture. 

I’m open to other suggestions if anyone else has something that’s worked.

"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently been experimenting with muscle ups and managed to do my first ‘slow’ muscle up with the false grip. The thing is, I hold the false grip on the bar with my entire hand fully over the bar, with the only contact point being on the wrist itself. Ive seen some tutorials online saying that this is the way to do it, but I also see many advanced calisthenics practitioners seemingly grabbing the bar itself while in false grip. Which way is correct? How can I progress to the other form of false grip if needed, as it seems that the act of flexing my fingers causes my wrist to pop out of the false grip position?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So 1 year ago I managed to get my first muscle up (with knee raise assistance) and I trained for a long 10 months before I was finally able to raise my muscle up reps from 1 to 2. So I figured that the reason why I was taking so long to go from 1 to 2 reps was because I wasn't training very efficiently. My previous workout involved doing sets of 1 muscle up each with 5 mins rest in between, followed by some explosive pullups and dips. So I removed muscle up from my workout completely and did the following routine instead with 2mins rest in between sets. I would do 4 sessions of the following routine before testing out my muscle up reps on the 5th session. Every week I would train 2 sessions

5 sets of 3-4 explosive pullups, 
5 sets of 5-6 jumping muscle up+Straight Bar Dip+Negative Muscleup(or Pullover + Negative Muscle up if I'm too tired to do a jump muscle up)

This was the workout that finally got me my second muscle up. But I've trained this routine for about 1 month+ now and didn't see much progress yet. Is there any way I can improve this routine to further increase the pace at which I can progress beyond 2 muscle ups? I'm not sure if the combination of jumping muscle up+Straight Bar Dip+Negative is counter-productive since it essentially combines 3 exercises into one.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I feel like there's an endless amount of fitness companies that cater to different groups like bodybuilding, CrossFit, yoga, dance, etc., But does anyone have a brand that they like that makes stuff for someone like me who enjoys bodyweight workouts? I'm a male, mid thirties, who started off doing some gymnastics and parkour when I was younger and love being able to still do handstands and pullups, and will go to the park to take advantage of the grassy field and pull-up and dip bars.  

When I shop, I find rings and gloves on Amazon, but would love to find a company that makes stuff specifically for people like me. I'm sure there's some pretty neat companies that make the kind of stuff that would help progress my training, or would be more comfortable to wear when I'm training at the park. Anyway, just trying to find a brand that I might like but don't know exists yet.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I used to complain a lot in high school about how I was working out consistently and wasn’t getting any stronger. Well, I was I guess, but at an extremely slow rate. Recently, I starting taking whey protein powder that has creatine in it (I didn’t even know what creatine was). I noticed that during my gym sessions I was significantly stronger and able to train longer, my muscles looking visibly bigger too. My theory is that my genetic makeup causes my cells to have naturally very low ATP stores and that’s why I feel such a dramatic difference from creatine. I was always training to failure but I think my muscles were failing so fast that there was not enough muscle damage and time under tension to make gains. It finally feels like a linear progression where every gym session I am a little bit stronger than I was last time. My question is what if I stop taking creatine but continue working out? Will I just go back to being just as weak and as I was before? Will my progress go back to being extremely slow? Not trying to gather pity here just genuinely curious.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I've been working out for 4 years now, I started working out when I was 23 years old but before that I would occasionally swim and hang out in parks a lot, doing poor pull-ups on the monkey bars and I would ride bicycle quite a lot.

I've found out that in the recent years, last year specifically, I gain skills while not training specifically for the skill itself. But what's weird is that when I actually train for a skill specifically, I cannot achieve the skill and I might get weaker. Such an example is getting my first muscle up. I always trained moderate intensity for about 45min to 1hour and the following was my workout log at that time. 10×4 pull-ups; 10×4 chin ups; 8×3 tuck front lever pulls. 

I found that  after a while I attempted the muscle up and got it down in just mere seconds. I wasn't strong at all. Now I compare this to me getting the front lever. I know the intensity is way higher than the muscle up but I've been training for the front lever for much longer. It cannot be much more intense than full planche push-ups. And as of right now I can pull up 26kg for 5 reps. So what would it be? Also note that my other skills I've gotten by just one attempt and not training for it.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am beginning to think I need to modify my meal plan.

I weigh 190lbs and am fairly lean and tall. I am trying to gain weight rather rapidly. Am doing the gym time to go with it.

I work out twice a day with the aim of letting my exercise fuel my hunger for the next meal. I eat the same thing every day sorta kinda. Although lunch varies. So the day goes roughly:

Meal replacement shake:
240 cal, 25g protein

<Gym>

Breakfast: Greek yogurt, frozen berries, granola, peanut butter
1179 cal, 62g protein

Lunch: Something high carb with some protein (pizza, pasta generally)
Target ~700 cal, reasonable protein (30-50g ish)

260 cal, 50g protein

Dinner: 2 chicken breasts
568 cal, 100g protein

2947 cal

Breakfast takes me the longest to eat. Granted I’m more grazing than focused but sometimes I’m not done till 1pm which knocks everything off.

I guess I am curious about two things:
1.	How do you work through days you are having issues eating your goal meals?
2.	Is there something wrong with my breakfast plan that maybe could trigger some intolerance (in large qualities) or make keeping up with the rest of the day difficult?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm trying to progress in calisthenics but can't afford the equipment I'd need to progress further but I am able to use my schools gym. So I've decided to train using weights.

"Hello all,

I’ve been trying to nail down my ring dip proficiency by trying all sorts of variations. Recently someone suggested to try hollow body dips to improve shoulder strength. I started to incorporate these into my push days. I had a tendency to let the ring turn in on the eccentric so I’ve been making a conscious effort to keep them mostly parallel and to improve my ROM at the bottom position. Currently I’m at 5x6 looking to get 5x8 of these:

Hollow body ring dips:

" Hi folks,

I’m a noob in fitness and I want to start working my way up in calisthenics. I’m sick and tired of searching this topic on Google as I get bombarded with ads there and following that on Facebook and Instagram. I have no experience, so I can’t really tell which program is good. 

Little bit about me. I’m 44, 6 feet and about 200 lbs. I consider myself on the beginning of the heavy side. I can run 2-3 miles with 5 mph on a treadmill and do not have any major injuries. I can’t really do any pull-ups and only 6-7 push-ups in a set. 

What is the systematic way to start building my core for calisthenics? I need an easy to follow daily, weekly, monthly regimen. I have watched lot of YouTube videos, but no one talks about getting started from zero when one can’t do a single pull-up. Most of them are from trainers who want to sell their programs. I’m not opposed to paying, but as I said earlier, I have no way to know if these programs are any good. A lot of people say they’re ripoffs. 

Thanks in advance and happy new year!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi! I've been doing this routine for a while now, tweaking things here and there as I see fit. My goal is primarily to build muscle.

**Upper body workout:**  
-warm up with some abs and sometimes skills (l-sit, tuck planche, handstand)  
-pseudo planche push ups with parallettes until failure / near failure.  
-superset with chin ups / pull ups until failure / near failure.  
-rest for 3 to 5 minutes  
-repeat for a total of 6 times.  
-dropset the last set with push ups and negative or static chin ups.  
-end up with abs.

I'm able to do around 12 pseudo planche push ups with a good lean in the first set, descending to around 6 on the last set. With chin ups I'm able to do around 8-9 the first set, descending to around 5 on the last set. I do slow and controlled chin ups. 

For **lower body** I'm not so structured but I usually do 6 sets of pistol squats until failure (around 9 or 10), some calf raises and abs.

**Weekly schedule:** upper, lower, rest, upper, lower, rest, rest.

Is this a good way to set up my calisthenics? What would you change?

Let me know! Thank you!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi,

I used to train calisthenics 5-6 times/week, but when Covid hit I became super lazy and I haven’t trained any bodyweight fitness for a year now, and I can’t find any motivation to start either.

I used to separate Pull/Push exercises for each workout and my max rep was 24 BW pull-ups and 4-5 weighted (35 kg) pull-ups. Yesterday I tried some exercises and I can barely do 8 BW pull-ups and get totally exhausted. Seems like my muscle memory is totally gone. My Push-game is even worse.

My question is… How long does it usually take for someone after a 1-year break? Anyone with the same experience? How do I regain my old strength slowly but steadily? Is is better to start out with regular 3-5 sets with longer pauses in between or is it better to start out with a Grease the groove-strategy every 30 min or hour? I have a very robust bar at home I'm doing pull-ups on.

Thanks.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/mqb20o/embarrassing_question_here/)

First of, thank you again for everyone who helped out and gave me so much support. It's been about 6 months. I'm sorry I promised an earlier update but there really wasn't any improvement to share. (I'm especially sorry for u/bazooka_matt whom I promised a month progression update. Sorry)

So today, out of the blue, I decided to try to do some push ups on the floor, well, I did 5 in a row with perfect form without falling :) That is 5 more than I could have done 6 months ago lol. I'm the same weight as before. (but I'm 15 now) Also, before I could only do 10 knee pushups but now I can do about 20.

What I did: Honestly, I didn't stick to most of the things you guys mentioned, I did negatives about once a week but didn't really put that much effort into it. The main thing I did was I started weight training (ik this is a bodyweight sub, sorry), I do a ppl split 6 days a week and started watching my protein intake. I got stronger, and I guess that helped me complete the push ups.

I'm kinda making this update to thank you guys again, you gave me so much encouragement it's insane how much of a difference it made on my mental game. Seriously. Also wanted to have my old post linked again in case someone else is in the same position I was before, they can go through what you nice people suggested and give it a try.

"Hey everyone, thanks for reading.

I've been working out (at home) since august, doing basic calisthnetics. I feel like I made some decent progress during that time, but recently I've been wondering. Should I be pushing myself to the limit every workout?

Over time I became strong enough to do some exercises I couldn't do before. For example, at the beginning I couldn't do a single push-up. Now I can do about 16 reps x 4. The more 'capable' I became, the more i tried to increase my reps every week. I don't really stick to (example) 4x12 pushups, when I am able to do more. I usually do as many as I can, until I feel like my muscles are about to burst. It doesn't really hurt, it's just a feeling of huge strain.

Is this a good strategy for 'doing more'? Should I keep pushing myself until I can't anymore? or is there a better way? Thanks for any replies in advance :) I'm just trying to make the best progress possible","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

First post here so apologies if I am breaking a rule. I recently moved into a new apartment with some super nice high ceilings. The first thing I thought when I walked in the front door was ""Man, these are tall enough to train muscle ups indoors. As a result of this I have been researching the Khanh Trinh foldable pull up bar on amazon. It is tall enough to do muscle ups on it but my biggest concern is whether it is stable enough? 

Has anyone here ever used this pull up bar for muscle up training and if so would you be able to recommend it? The bar has a pretty hefty price of about 300ish dollars so I would hate to waste money on something that's a dud. There are very few reviews and although the company says it can be used for muscle ups I am still fairly skeptical.

"Hello everyone!
I started working out a couple of months ago at home, training in a PPL routine 6 days a week.

On push day I do 6 sets of pushups, 3 of them with added weight in a backpack, followed up by 3 sets DB presses, 3 sets of Flys, 4 sets of OHP and 3 sets of Triceps Dips.

First of I wanted to ask if this is enough to build muscle, i do this workout 2x a week. I‘m a beginner, weight 68kg at 185cm. (19 / male)

My Problem:

I noticed that my DB press really suffers when I do it after the pushups, I can almost double the reps if I do DB press first, but if I do it first I‘m barely able to do Pushups afterwards, no weighted Pushups.

For building muscle, should I do the DB presses or pushups first? Does it even matter or am I allowed to switch up the order based on my liking on that day? 

I hope its okay I‘m asking this question here, because I‘m including Dumbbells…

Sorry if this question is dumb and I‘m just overthinking, I just feel like there is so many things that can „ruin your gains“ according to YouTube, litteraly drives me crazy.

"So I'm reaching the ending stage of the RR and I love it so I keep doing it adding weights, I currently do weighted series on almost all exercises and I do 4 series instead of 3.

- Sumo deadlift 
- Hip thrust or kettle swing
- Bulgarian split squat 
- Nordic Curls

I've been lifting weights for 10+ years, but am finding myself needing to get back into the groove so I will be taking a page out of his book and trying something like this protocol for myself.

I went ahead and documented some things in a Google Doc. I think it might be hard for me to find 2ish hours out of the day for a workout, at least getting started, so I morphed this into a 2 day variable split as well as documented his protocol as described above on a separate sheet.

During the pandemic I wanted to get fit and started body weight fitness (also used bands). I made definite progress in the hypertrophy department but eventually hit a peak. I ended up buying a squat rack for my home and started lifting weights. Of course, I made a lot more progress in the hypertrophy department this way.

I have navigated away from body weight fitness and exclusively do weightlifting. The sole reason I have is that I get more hypertrophy results faster with weight lifting. I know I could have continued to do both, but the novelty of exercising has kind of gone away, so I just want to minimize the time I spend on it.

How about you guys? Have any of you returned to weight lifting since the pandemic ended? Do you continue to do body weight fitness or have you quit?

"Hi guys, so as the title says, I have been struggling with my handstand progress.

 I started a few months back and at first the progress was coming really fast. 

The thing is, I always only did chest to wall handstands, as I'm terrified of the kickup, which I'm aware is an issue. 

I'm probably an intermediate and strength Is definitely not an issue, however the balance is. At the beginning of my handstand training, I basically measured how far my hands are from the wall everytime and progressed that way.

 After a while I got to a point where my hands are at about one hand away from the wall. Since then I tried to improve my balance and get my feet away from the floor, and I did - a couple times for just seconds. 

Sometimes I found the balance but immediately fell back because of fear of falling forward. Lately I also feel like I'm using way too much strength in the handstand and have zero balance and awareness. I can't seem to get my alignment right either. 

I feel a lot of preassure on my shoulders and I'm not sure if that's normal.
 I always do my handstands on the wall for 45 seconds for 4sets, resting 2 minutes between.
 I do them after my warm up and before my push workouts, which I do twice per week. 

Should I start practicing handstands more often? I never did because after push sessions I would always be sore and I feel like it would limit my handstands a lot. 
Also it seems like handstands are interrupting my hypertrophy workouts, which I mainly focus on.
 Today I felt very weak after handstands and incline pike push ups were almost impossible with proper form. 

What is the fastest way to progress and get away from the wall? How many times per week should I train the handstand, since I'm focusing on hypertrophy training? I will appreciate any tips.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Im not sure if my notion is incorrect, but does BWF promote mobility ""naturally"" through its movements such as pullups, pistol squats etc, or am I reaching here?

"Like I said in the title, been trying to muscle up since the last 4 months. I saw a comment on some earlier post here saying that you should keep increasing your normal pull ups reps, weight and improving form (chest to bar and above). 

While I can't get a chest to bar yet on 10 kgs, I can do 17 of those in one set. Plus, after a few days of rest, can even go over 20 in a single set. I have been working on increasing my tricep bar dips reps too. Can get some decent reps now, after unintentionally injuring my chest around 2 months ago when I went too hard on them one night. 

Now, the bar that I use also is covered in foam. Is that preventing me from fully turning my palms upward and pushing or is it the aftereffects of the injury still lingering around? 

What happened in that injury exactly was that I forced my self to do more reps than what my body could endure and couldn't do a single rep of diamonds or dips themselves without my sternum having an intense bout of pain right in the middle whenever I attempted em for a month.

Now that I have almost recovered after doing wide ring push ups only, I can do 14 again. 

So, what's stopping me from getting a muscle up now? 

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

The day after and I'm quite sore. Moving forward, I aim to beat the sets by 1 rep every week for the three sets, using deload as appropriate. I have 4 years training experience so understand fatigue management, basic progression etc but this movement is a bit trickier. I'm thinking get the first set up to something insane like 15-20 reps and try using my lighter band. I'm not interested in learning a hands free nordic trick, I use this for injury prevention and hamstring size. 

&#x200B;

1 more rep each time. How does this sound folks?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"\[absolute beginner here\]

Situation: I can do one set (8 reps) of body rows with my legs straight. And then I take a 2 min break - and try to do the 2nd set but cant go beyond 5-6. Subsequent sets are worse and I try to get to 8 reps each set by bending my legs and reducing the length of my outstretched body.

I've been stuck at this for about 6 weeks now - but I know I've progressed in some other aspects (like I can 2 band assisted pull ups with proper form, previously I couldnt do even one)

Is there a way to understand if this is normal? Am I being impatient? Maybe I am, but I dont have much of a reference point on how slow/fast progressions should be. 

I'm obese, 5'9'' and 204lbs. My diet is I'd say around 80-90% controlled. I used to 220lbs a few months ago - so at least something is working in my diet.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey! I’ve been lurking here for a few years now, and last year started working out with rings and a pull-up bar. Earlier this year when the gyms opened I started going to the gym and cross training weights with a couple body weight exercises. Recently I made it a goal to get muscle ups by the 1st of December. I can rep out 15+ perfect form pull-ups and right now do weighted pull-ups with an extra 15lbs for about 6 reps, so I’m pretty confident I have the strength, and it’s just the technique throwing me off.

So far I’m on Day 3 of my training, and looking at the [video](https://imgur.com/gallery/40JxB0j) I feel like I’m so close, I’m just missing something to get that last little push above the bar. I’m thinking I need to drive my knees back a little harder on the upswing? Any advice or tips would be much appreciated. Thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
So growing up i was always big. I was always taller then most people my age. My height right now is 5.9 to 5.10. I do always go to the doctors and they try to help but they always tell me the same thing “just eat better and be more active”. I am eating way better then i was before I only and i mean ONLY drink water. Growing up i hated soda I’ve always hated soda and i just never drink it. But starting off i am trying to be more active at school i try my hardest in gym class running around. At home i try to do push ups the max i can do is three. I do sit-ups in my room and do jumping jacks. I really am trying but i feel like im going nowhere. I don’t have the option to going to a gym. And my doctors just only tell me to cut my portions. This is my first time trying to seek help online and just see if someone can help me. My weight isn’t my only issue either to begin with. I’ve always had bad self esteem. And i easily get demotivated and lose the urge to work on myself. I always have the mindset that i can work on myself later or when I’m trying to lose weight that im not heading anywhere. Anyways thanks for reading my situation and really any tips do help.,"bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So, I don't have any gym equipments like dumbbells, barbells, weights anything... But i got bricks. Lots of them. And bags too.

So, my question is how do I effectively incorporate them into the RR? The bricks weigh about 2-3kgs each.
_____________________________
I dunno if anybody would be interested in reading so you can skip it but the thing is i have always been skinny (106lb/49kg at 5'6) and i hate it. Being insulted by kids in schools, relatives and even my own dad sometimes. 
And i overall have a very weak personality. 

So, i have finally decided to take control of things and have decided that i want to make improvements to my physique as much as possible in the next 3 months as by then i will pass on to a higher class and want to make a good first impression.

I have read the FAQs and i overall have an idea of what to do (except for the bricks) I have finished the bwf primer, added more calories to my diet (600-1000) by eating 3 bowls of about 200 calories of of nuts&pb throughout the day and i am also trying to add some sprouts/lentils too for more calories and protein. (Also can anybody else tell about some high protein vegetarian foods?)

Since my final exams (*very important*) are also coming and the fact that my sister is like a national level topper in that exam so I also have a lot of expectations and pressure on me too. I feel like when I exercise i feel very relieved and it clears my mind. 

I know this part became a bit ranty so sorry for that.

"So, I have decided to try and get off my lazy ass and try and at least start doing some exercise. I'm 19M and haven't really done any physical activity the last 7 or 8 years. Maybe the occational try on some pull ups or simething to see if I could do them.


I started climbing at a local gym that opened earlier this year, but not nearly often enough to be called working out or whatever. I have been maybe 10 or so times this year. As well as maybe once a week trying an L-sit and some pull ups to see how long/many I could do. Just a single try.


So I like setting goals, like checking off things on a list, even if it is not the most efficient say of doing things. I don't really know what is realistic, as I don't want to set a goal that is uber ridiculous. I thought I wanted to go for some amount of L-sit, 3 muscle ups and then 1 or 2 more exercises that I don't know what should be yet.


Currently I have been able to hold an L-Sit for 20 second, though I'm shaking quite a bit as well as ~8 pull ups with what I think is ok form. As for the L-sit, whay s realistic? I couldn't find much info on how long is long. Some YT videos of people doing ~1 min on the floor or 2 min hanging from a bar. Then this lady who apparently held it for like 7 minutes or something on the floor. Which just made me even more confused as to what to aim for. And the 3 muscle ups where inspired by Mike Boyd.


Any thought? Or is this just plain stupid?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm 15 years old, 5'11 and weigh 70kg. I had my weight loss journey a few months ago from 92 kg to 70 kg, but the thing is I didn't do any form of calisthenics at the time.

I started calisthenics a few times here and there did planks, push ups till I had a strain in my back and felt weirs coming back to doing reps again. 

At the moment I do 3 sets of 20 pushups, 15 sit ups and 15 leg raises, and recently I started doing lunges. I do shadow boxing too, why idk I kinda enjoy it. A few weeks ago I stopped doing planks, cause I seem to have lost the enjoyment with it. I'm planning on going on long walks again along with jogs for cardio.

"curious to know how many of you utilize bodyweight training as your primary means of training in regards to hypertrophy and aesthetics as opposed to just general health and functionality?

my entire background has revolved around lifting weights not only to be strong but more importantly build a great physique..think fitness model looking physique. of course, the conventional way to do this is to lift. but I'm genuinely wondering if any of you utilize bodyweight training..perhaps weighted calisthenics with the same goal in mind. and if you do how are your results.

reason im asking is i stopped lifting sometime ago. my goals have of course changed as ive aged. i want to feel good, be mobile, be functional, etc and I'm hoping calisthenics can help with this. im just wondering if perhaps a byproduct of training this way could potentially result in developing such a physique. i mean, I see calisthenic guys on Instagram who train primarily through bodyweight movements and look like they've been bodybuilding their whole life. additionally, we do have guys like daniel from fitnessfaqs whose physique is, in my opinion, at an elite level. however who can know whether these guys are on some sort of gear or not.

do you think that calisthenics done with the purpose of improving strength function mobility could also lead to some significant changes in aesthetics? and have some of you or people you know experienced this?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Hey everyone. I lost a lost of weight in the past 2 years. I stuck to 1200 calories for a year and recently fell off the wagon, eating many desserts etc. A month ago I decided to start focussing on getting stronger to see change in my body because although I lost lots of weight, I felt fat. I suppose because I have never been toned in my life. While I loved being super slim, I realised I was just weak and felt fragile. I want to be strong now! I'd really appreciate if someone could help point me in the right direction in terms of calorie intake. Ive been eating around 1300-1500 calories daily. I work out about 5 days in the week. But by workout, I mean at home and it's barely as intense as what I've seen others do. I do 30mins brisk walking on the treadmill (varying between 5-7mph) and do about three 15 minute workouts beforehand that I just find on YouTube focussing on abs, arms and legs, but low impact because I do cardio on the treadmill. I was so proud of myself when I hit the week mark of working out because i powered through the DOMS for the first time in my life instead of giving into the pain and never trying again. Now I feel pain during a workout but rarely the day afterwards. I am 62kg (I think,  after eating im around 65kg) 5""9, female and my sedentary TDEE is around 1750 calories. These calculators have parts where you can say you're slightly active, but I really don't know if my workouts are even considered exercise that requires higher calorie intake. This is really new to me and I cant seem to make sense of it all.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Hi all. As title, I've been using the H6 HRM for indoor HIIT sessions (via YT) for about a year and a half now. It's been excellent so far. Paired up with the ""MyWorkouts"" app on Android. Rock solid.

However, recently, I've been getting drop outs on the HR signal. Just intermittent (or at least I thought). I guessed it might be the battery so I changed that, still same issue (even tried another brand of battery, just in case).

Then I worked out what the issue was. The HR signal was dropping whenever I did an exercise facing down such as press-ups, mountain climbers, etc. The signal came back within a few seconds of getting upright again.

Quite odd, especially as it's been solid for the majority of the time I've had it. The strap is adjusted nicely, although I've also changed the strap length both shorter and longer. There's moisture between the strap and my chest too.

I've since tried using other apps and other devices but same issue.

I've emailed CooSpo but am cynical they can/will do anything given I've had it over a year. But still, has anyone else found this with their HRM, whether this one or another?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"So, as background, my workout routine is basically the same as RR, but I added three sets of chin-ups and headstand push-ups rather than replacing pull-ups and ring push-ups because I didn't want to neglect any muscle groups. This has worked pretty well for me, since the added chin-ups have done a lot to improve my pull-ups while improving my biceps a bit more than pull-ups by themselves.

Now, I'm close to doing 8 pull/chin-ups, and I'm thinking about how I'm going to do typewriters with my current set-up. I use rings and a door frame pull-up bar, which is great so far, but doesn't really give me enough room to do typewriters (I've tried, and while I can kind of move to the side either way, I definitely can't straighten my arm).

That said, ring typewriters might be possible, but not side to side. Would moving one arm forward, rather than to the side, provide the same benefits as standard ring typewriters? I can pull my legs up enough to provide enough strap length for the motion, I just don't know if it counts as a ""real"" typewriter pull-up, since I'm moving my assisting arm in a totally different direction.

And yes, I know, I could do weighted pull-ups instead, or else go to a playground or something, but the former doesn't work for me because budget, while the latter doesn't work for me right now because acute neuropathy makes my hands super sensitive to the Winter cold (and I also like to spread my workout throughout the morning so I can do work at the same time, so making 6 trips to the local playground would defeat the purpose of that when I can otherwise walk 1 foot to my closet).","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Hey,

I've been training handstands for over a year now and have achieved a 30s+ hold, a multitude of shapes and even some one arm leans. That's great and I love that I can do these kind of things now.

But! There's a catch (at least that's how I view it). I have good and bad days. On good days, I am able to do all the aforementioned skills during my handstand sessions. The bad thing is that most of my days are bad days. These are days where I struggle to even get a clean kick up and stay there for 5-10s. On these days, I mostly focus on wall drills, such as B2W and C2W rebalancing drills, but I feel like this isn't sufficient for my handstand practice.

Enough blabbering, my question(s) is as following: How should I structure my practice sessions on bad days? Should I try kicking up, repeatedly, even if I fail a lot? Continue with wall drills? Also, what do you guys suggest for how to construct a more structured handstand routine? I feel like having a structured plan is better than winging it and doing cool stuff on my hands.

Cheers,","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi you all!
I (F27) have been working out regularly for the past half year and in October started to focus on my upper body strength as I realised I needed it. My great goal would be to manage the Bar Pullover.

I train pull-ups with an elastic band, honestly without it from the dead hang I can do one and that's it. I'm doing a lot of negatives and inverted rows to build up to more, but that's wher I'm at right now.

I would like and advice on how to progress. How long might I expect to take to get to the pullover, and what could be really important excercise I might be missing. I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos, but it's difficult to get a realistic picture, since the people who show the movement already have an extremely advanced  control over their body, and there is no struggle to be seen ^^","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I was a gym rat going on 14 years before the pandemic hit. It has been an incredible journey this past year and a half exercising with minimal equipment and I am still learning  things. 

A recent one I realized was to emphasize biceps more I take a broom, wrap towels on each end so the handle does not damage anything, and hold it outside of a doorway, letting the covered parts rest against the frame. Then I can lean away from it and curl myself only koving forearms, I feel way more focus on my biceps

"Personal Trainers/experienced trainers: What’re the differences between gaining strength through one arm presses vs two simultaneously?

I ask because I have a pair of Olympic handles with plates up to 130 to 135 lbs per dumbbell (270 lbs total). I can probably fit a bit more plates. I also don’t have a bench. I figure I can more easily position one heavy dumbbell when alone instead of two.

So, Does lifting 130 lbs on one arm at a time transfer strength gain to roughly about double that, or would I only be able to handle 130 lbs total for pushing? 

I’m confused with how that works versus doing two arms simultaneously (ie: 260 lbs).

My plan is to use dumbbells for overall strength, while practicing planche, front lever, muscles ups and one arm pulls with bodyweight","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi, I'm a beginner in working out, and I have been suffering from shoulder pains for 3 years. 2 years ago I saw a physical therapist, did some X-rays and my doctor diagnosed an issue on rotator cuff, more specifically a little calcification that hurts when I rotate my shoulder.
He gave me some exercises to do, I'm not fully healed but it's better.

I'd like to try the Recommended Routine, but with a focus on rotator cuff.

- Internal & external rotation
- PNF diagonal shoulder exercise

- I'm 25, 66kg for 1m69

However his routine is only a 30 mins push-up pull-ups and squats variation in a circuit, and he does them everyday. i’m wondering why if these 3 exercises with their variations are enough to build muscles and a great physique, why people like to do different exercises and have many various exercises in their routine?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've constructed a routine, let me know what you think:

# Goals
- All of it: strenght, weight loss and muscle mass. 
- Pairing this with a good diet should shape me up for summer.
- Must be simple, and easy to remember. Three times per week, 1 hour max workout time.

# Principles
When the upper rep range can be performed with good form, increase difficulty with weight or harder progression. 

Rest 2mins.

Every 6th week is a recovery week, with 1-2 workouts of 50% intensity.

# Workout structure
- Short warmup.
- Chest, front of shoulders: Forward lean pseudo planche pushups with feet elevated. 3 sets, 5-10 reps.
- Legs: One leg bodyweight squat (more joint friendly pistol squatting) 3 sets, 5-10 reps.
- Back: Weighted chinups. 3 sets, 5-8 reps.
- Shoulders: Wall handstand pushups. 3 sets, 4-8 reps.
- Abs and biceps superset: 2 sets to failure. Aim for 8-12 reps per set.

I know it's very simple, and by analogy not perfect. I am willing to trade perfection for simplicity and efficiency.

note : i come from a country where the quality of physiotherapy available to a layman is not very good (i must add with this particular physio, i am seeing some positive results though) and i have been burnt by a physio before due to him not correcting my form on my corrective exercises and as a result there being no improvement in my condition for 6 months.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I am stuck and at a loss of ideas on how to move forward.

I weigh about 180lbs. Using about +25% BW I can do 5x5 (Shoulder Width, Overhand) - tried going for 4x6 but got 5 and 4 on the last two sets. I recently hit 6x3 with the same weight using a Close grip. If I perform Underhand Close grip I can almost hit 3x8 with the same weight. I've also done 6x3/arm with the same weight using an ""Uneven"" grip. 
For max weight, I can do 3x2 using about +50% BW with an Underhand grip and hands a few inches apart.

It took me roughly a year to work up to this level with a twice a week training session.

BW wise, I can do 15 pullups in a set (Shoulder Width, Overhand grip) and 20 chinups in a set (Underhand, Close grip). I have experimented with many different types of assisted one arm chinups. Band/Towel assisted (off hand holding lower to the point where at the end of the pull I'm essentially pushing down with my off hand). Uneven (to the point where my off hand is above my pulling hand's elbow). I've tried holding the doorframe with my off hand at head and shoulder height level.

At one point I could jump to the top of the bar using an Underhand grip, let go and come down a few inches before pulling back up. Can't seem to do that now for some reason... I've also tried slow half and full one arm negatives using Underhand grip.

How can I move forward to actually get a one arm chinup???","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

He has a well-designed instructional page [here](https://formiseverything.com/2020/11/19/the-many-basic-calisthenics-exercises-you-can-do-with-gymnastics-rings-and-how-to-do-them/) that describes a big range of bodyweight exercises to be done on rings, and he demonstrates these in short video clips done in his backyard.  He also has a [youtube channe](https://www.youtube.com/user/sdrader/videos)l with <400 subscribers - which is a pity in my view given how much work he's obviously put into his videos and his fitness. 

I'm a rank beginner so I can't comment on his form. What I did appreciate as a grey-beard of 60 who is just starting BWF is that he's not a young and perfect body-builder or gymnast. He's not buff, and he never takes his shirt off to show how shredded he is. He's kind of like me, but much stronger, and this is encouraging.

I used rely on bouldering to ensure sufficient diversity of movement, with that missing I'm now more dependent on proper programming. I pick one workout from below every day I train. All are done circuit style, with next exercise every 3 minutes. All relevant exercises are done using rings.  

One armed pullup workout, 5 rounds (45min):

* Pseudo planche pushups for 5-10 reps.
* One armed pullup for 5 reps, with 25% counter weight, left hand.
* One armed pullup for 5 reps, with 25% counter weight, right hand.

Frontlever workout, 6 rounds (55min).

* Side lunge for 10 reps, with focus on range and mobility, left leg.
* Side lunge for 10 reps, with focus on range and mobility, right leg.
* Straddle front lever for 15-20 seconds.

Deadhang workout, 5 rounds (45min).

* Deadhang for 20-40 seconds 18mm edge half crimp and 45% counter weight, left hand.
* Deadhang for 20-40 seconds 18mm edge half crimp and 45% counter weight, right hand.
* Wide pullups for 7-10 reps, back arched chest to ""bar"", pause at top.

I have been strength training for the past 4 years, bouldering for the past 3 years, with no strength training history prior to that (started with 1 half assed pullup and maybe 4 pushups). 42 year old male, 175cm/5'9"" 67kg/148lb. Been in ketosis for 5 years, cardio wise in reasonably good shape (cooper test 3100m).

Questions:

*  Should I try to include pike pushup or dumbell overhead press in the workout?
* Am I missing any obvious muscle groups?
* How come I cant bench my bw, but I can do controlled full rom one armed pushups for reps?
* Does the training plan look sustainable?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've recently started doing HIIT with plyometrics (jump squats, broad jumps etc) but I'm not sure how long I should be resting for. My work sets normally last around 45 seconds. If I rest twice as long as I work I feel 90% recovered and can give it my all for the next set but it doesn't feel all that intense. If I only rest for 45 seconds then I don't feel I've recovered enough and struggle to perform my sets with good technique and explosiveness, but obviously it feels alot more intense.

"Hi all,

I’ve progressed to weighted dips, been doing these for a while but just wanted to confirm what my leg position should be to maximise results from the exercise. Mainly want to ensure chest is getting worked (ideally lower chest more if possible).

For weighted dips using a belt, my bars are not high enough to allow me to have a straight body from head to toe so I have been leaning forward with my thighs  perpendicular to the floor, my lower legs are at a 90 degree angle to my thighs, behind me parallel to the floor (I don’t cross them and I try to keep my legs together always squeezing tight). Is this good leg positioning for weighted dips? Or should I lean forward and try to keep a straight line from my head to my knees and then have lower legs behind me parallel to the floor?

Also I want to try to move onto ring dips, I have a pull up bar but it’s not high enough to have a straight body without my feet touching the ground, what is the best alternative leg position? Can I maintain a tuck L position all throughout the dip? Or how about maintain a straight body where I can, but lift my legs slightly up in front of me before they touch the floor? Would bending knees and lower legs behind me work?

Thanks for the help!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been training to get a muscle up on the rings for the past 8 weeks, and I just can't seem to get it. I have been following this training guide to get here.

My issue is with my transition from a pull up to a dip.

-pull up straight grip 12-15x4
-barbell curls 4x12 (2x12 with both hands then rest for 2 min)
-concentration curls with barbells 12x4

"Hi, 

I m doing the RR 3x times a week for 9month now and get pretty nice fast results. 188cm/87kg male. Currently at 3x5 pullups 3x8 pistolesquads and so on. Pretty much hitting the max reps of the first progressions. My main aim is to build muscles and lose some %bodyfat + my small belly on the way.
 
I have a few questions to add HIIT / Spinning to my Workout plan.

1) i consider adding small 15min full Body HIIT Session after the RR. Does this have a bad Influence on building muscles? By Google i just find to not to it before/to long but no real scientific answers. Does is maybe even help?

2) should i / can i do longer HIIT (30-40 min) workouts on the between days or does this too destroy my aim to build muscles?
i love Team HIIT trainings with a heartbeat sensor with aim to stay above 80% max heart rate and only drop below in the resting times

3) how about spinning classes with the same structure - Intervall Units with getting max heart rate 80-95% max? 

Thanks in advance!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hello guys,

I follow the recommended routine for about a year (using mostly rings) and progressed well so far. I only have trouble adapting to more complex exercises but that's another story. Currently, I can do the standard exercises (Pull Up, PushUp, Dips, Rows) in Rings with a good form for some reps. So far I used to use the normal pause timings as described in the RR routine and focussed purely on strength. Generally, I want to focus more on endurance for the next couple of weeks and bring my reps in the foundation exercises up. 

In Germany, the winter begins and I train outside so it gets really cold, especially when there is no sun.   When strictly doing 90sec pause especially my writs will cool down in between the sets which are uncomfortable and increase my chance to get injured. Therefore I'm thinking about changing my training to a more circuit-based training style in order to stay warm. I think that should be in harmony with the goal of increasing my reps. 

I would think about something like PullUp > PushUp > Rows > Dips each with 20-30 seconds pause in between and then resting for 2mins while doing rope jumps or something similar.

Does that make any sense or do you got any other recommendations when it gets cold?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

The thing is, other than that I am completely sedentary. All my classes are online and I almost never go outside. My parents do all the groceries, etc. so I don't need to. I spend virtually all day on my chair in front of my computer and occasionally I walk around in circles in my  room for 5-20 minutes when I have an idea and I'm imagining I'm explaining it to someone but other than that I don't move at all. I am not looking for weight loss anymore, nor endurance, but I am a bit worried about my health. Will only doing the strength workout keep me healthy enough?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey all,

I’ve gotten pretty proficient at leaned forward, straight body ring dips working at 5 sets of 10 reps. I recently programmed Bulgarian ring dips into one of my two push days as I continue to perform ring dips on the other. I can manage a 5x6 of these:

https://imgur.com/a/CcTcdFA

This subreddit doesn’t include Bulgarian ring dips in its exercise progression. Overcoming gravity does. According to this subreddit, I should move straight to RTO dip variations. I haven’t tried them though I suspect I won’t be able to push much volume starting out even at 45 degrees. Is it ok to incorporate 2 different primary ring push exercises at lower volume on two separate push days through the week? Or should I focus on one movement in my transition from regular ring dips?

I understand these two movements are intrinsically different (internal vs external shoulder position). My goal is to build strength and muscle.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm at a new job where I'm working at home. My gym membership is frozen until covid becomes less of an issue.

Right now I'm doing a set of 25 push ups at the top of every hour from 7 am to 4 pm. It takes about a minute and then I go back to work. (I switch it up every day, so other days it would be 10 sets of pull ups or 10 sets of crunches from 7 am to 4 pm).

I'm wondering if all this extra rest time makes the exercise less efficient in getting stronger/doing more reps than just blocking out 30 minutes to do multiple sets of push-ups with 1-2 minute rest times in between.

I do like that I get a little extra physical activity in between sitting at the computer all day, but I wonder if the shorter rest times have some kind of scientific reason for promoting more muscle growth or fatiguing the muscles to create more microtears or lactic acid building.

I do stuff with dumb bells after work like curls, shoulder presses, etc, but I wonder if I might as well spend a minute or two each hour doing some stretching or getting some sunlight to refresh myself, and stick to going hard after work and really push myself.

Probably the difference is so marginal as long as I am doing some kind of exercise, it's beneficial, but just wondering if there is more science to different rest times.

Edit: Appreciate the responses guys. I'm lucky to have a remote job, and finding ways to exercise between meetings and work is a blessing. I'm going to keep doing it since it's a good habit to have even if doesn't have the intensity of normal gym session.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

When training on strength, my endurance has dropped a bit after not jumping rope or doing burpees for time or really much of any cardio now that I think about it for about 6(?) months or so. What is the most efficient way to get my endurance back and surpass what I used to be? I hope age doesn't start to destroy my total PB's and I'm looking to be better than I was.  


Should I mix strength (unfortunately, which I feel I now have plateaued as the gains are so unbelievably minimal) & endurance work or should I just focus on endurance now with one day a week for strength maintenance? 100/150 burpees for time is a great workout, but so is jumping rope hard for 45 mins.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"Help with bulking

Hi everyone so I’m pretty new into fitness. I’m a 6’1 and I weigh 200 pounds age 21. I’m am what you would call skinny fat. My legs and arms and really thin with a belly. You may be asking why I didn’t cut first? Well I really don’t like seeing my arms and legs so skinny it makes me insecure. I’ve always wanted to be a bigger bodied person and I believe bulking will help me reach that goal. I recently started going back to the gym on a strict bulking diet which I’ve been following for 2 weeks now. I’ve calculated that my maintenance calories are 3000 so I’ve been eating in a small surplus of 200. I believe this will make me gain roughly 1/2 lb each week. Below I’ll add my micros and calories I end everyday with. Any tips will help a lot. I’ve gained about 1 pound already in the course of these past 2 weeks. I plan to bulk for 5-6 months then follow a cut diet with a deficit of 500 calories.
Should I make any changes??

"Hey guys/gals,

I’ve just started training Brazilian Jiu Jitzu, and I’m really enjoying it. I feel like I get a really good work out every time I go do a session. But I struggle a lot with it in some aspects like being taken down and holding certain positions because I’m just not heavy enough. I know it’s partly technique, but my coach said it’s a good idea to get heavier, considering I’m quite light for my height. I used to be a pro level cyclist, so really quite light, especially my upper body. I’m 25, male, 200cm tall and I usually hover around 82-83kgs. I would  like to get myself into the high 90’s (even 100kgs if possible) if my body frame allows it. I feel like resistance training with my body weight would be the most efficient way to build lean muscle mass, and just wondering how I should start? Im thinking just standard sorta things for now, sit ups, push ups, squats, etc to work on form before I start adding extra weight. But is there any exercises and/or tips anyone has that they swear by or something a noob like me should know? 

Also, nutrition seems like a big complicated world. At least more complicated than what I’m used to. Cycling nutrition pretty much involved carbs, carbs and a few more carbs, with some caffeine here and there. No fats, not a heck of a lot of protein compared to what most people think (it’s no secret there’s different substances used in recovery for cycling). Any nutrition advice helps a lot.

"I recently unlocked the tuck planche with what I believe is good form (back parallel to ground). Last time I tried I held it for 7 seconds. My routine is split into push/pull/push/pull/push/pull/rest each week. On my push days I do 3 sets of assisted pistol squats, 3 vertical push sets (I choose from dips, face to wall HeSPU, pike push-ups on parallettes or decline pike pushups usually) and 3 horizontal push movements (I choose from explosive pushups, clapping pushups, decline pseudo-planche push-ups or one arm + 5 finger pushups usually). I also did the crow stand as skill work as I never felt it as a strength skill and only as a balance skill (which I can now hold for 50 seconds). Recently I just added one extra set of tuck planche on top of all that on my push days but I'm wondering how to integrate it into the routine properly so that I achieve the planche as quick as possible and still get hypertrophy but also not overtrain? 

I know you shouldn't do much more than 20 sets per week per muscle group, and since my routine was initially based on the RR I did the usual 6 sets per workout per muscle group + 3 workouts. Adding one extra planche set would be 21 pushing sets per week, but I also heard that it's an isometric movement so it doesn't count as a full set when it comes to overtraining and stuff because it's not as demanding on the body. So then how many sets of tuck planche should I do, or is it possible to remove some, if not all pushing exercises from my routine and replace them all with like 18 sets of tuck planche per week or something? (Assuming I still want hypertrophy and general pushing strength that's transferable to other movements)","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

I'm 50kg and can't seem to change that at all, even before I started cycling so much.

***How do I put on weight overall without putting myself at risk of cardiac issues from my cholesterol?***

Yes I eat a lot; as much as I can - I carbload before big rides and I eat plenty of protein (that'll reduce a bit in the new year for cholesterol purposes). I don't eat much fruit because it's so expensive here but I eat a good amount of veg. I've been recommended by my GP to not use protein supplements because I'm still growing so that's not an option. Nutrition on the bike consists of carb/oat bars, gels and sweets. I have alright core strength from cycling but everything is really skinny and ugh.

"Dear Redditors,

Last week I posted a question about starting with calisthenics again. Thanks to your advice I started with the BWF Primer, and I am now in my 2nd week (day 7). Everything is going well! Eventually I came to the realization to change my regular push ups to knee push ups. Because of my medication I need more time for my muscles and probably add 2 more weeks with the BWF Primer. After this I am planning to start with the RR.

Despite my medication, I consider myself active. I have an average of 15000 steps a day and cycle to work and back around 60 km a week. 
 
I hope I gave enough information. If you need to know more, just ask! 

Nevertheless I have a question about my food intake. I am eating healthy and eating around 2500 calories a day.

Here’s my situation:

At the moment, with the BWF Primer, I am almost training every day. On Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday 
I add a 5k run after finishing with the BWF Primer. 

When I start with RR I will do BWF on M - W - F and ending every training with a 5k run. On Sunday I will go for a long easy run. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are for rest. 

I am 38 years old, 181 cm and 75 kg. I consider myself a skinny fat person. I don’t have any fat on my chest. Only around my abdomen. And I want to lose that belly fat and gain (some) muscles.

But I don’t know how. I am reading lots about cut and bulk, bulk and cut and gaintaining. But I actually don’t know what to do, what to choose, and what to do on my days of rest.

"I'm 16 M and I am an active person doing workouts 5-6 a week using my body weight. I am 5'3 and weigh 128 which is a healthy weight. I'm here to ask about the protein intake I'm taking daily because recently I read an article (Forgot the title) that too much protein could harm my kidney. 4 per kilogram is about 228 grams of protein daily but I sometimes could go a little higher around 250. I am clean bulking; not eating crappy foods such as fast foods but I do eat lean meats and mostly dairy for my diet. My protein came from dairy mostly; 1 cup of cottage cheese at night, 2 cups of greek yogurt, and about 2/5 of low-fat milk, also some 6 pieces of Tyson's chicken breast strips which I cook in an oven. I don't know for sure if this protein intake can cause any harm to my body in the long term but I have only done this 2 weeks ago and have never seen any significant symptoms of any sickness but instead seen an improvement in my physique and have gotten stronger lifting weights and can perform more sets and reps than consuming less protein before. Is this okay if I gonna keep this journey forward or shall I just decrease my protein intake to reduce the ""might"" consequences in the future? Provide at least evidence of why protein high protein intake can harm kidneys. I will fully appreciate yall answers down below people.

Note: This is my first time posting in Reddit and I don't know if my writing is understandable but I hope it does.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I have to complete so called ""fitness test"" after 2 months and I need some advices on how to train for it. Currently I've been training pretty much the recommended routine 2-3 times a week, but I have done each exercise to 12 reps before progressing and I have done 4 sets instead of 3.

Right now my strength workout is:

*L-Sit Chin Up: 10 10 10 11*

*Handstand Pushup: 8 9 9 9*

*Ring Inverted Row (feet a lot higher than hands): 9 10 10 10*

*Ring Dip: 8 9 9 9*

*Archer Pushup: 8 9 9 9*

*Pistol Squat: 9 10 10 10*

Now the fitness test I have to take is pretty simple. It uncludes ""standing long jump"", pushups and sit ups. Standing long jump I have to obiviously jump as far as possible and pushups and situ ups max reps in 1 minute.

I have to get **at least** 110 points from the test and the points are calculated like this: 

*1 rep in pushups and sit ups counts as 1 point.*

*standing long jump points = distance in meters x 20*

And for max points I would have to get :

*2,7m standing long jump*

*53 sit ups*

*48 pushups*

How would I go on about training for these as my current routine doesnt really seem to be that benefitical for such a test. I dont know how many situps I can do right now or how long I can jump, but as for pushups I could manage to do only 31 reps when I just tried.

Should I ditch my current workout for now and change how I workout completly or should I add something onto it to squeeze more reps for pushups & situps? How would one train for standing long jump?

All help is greatly appreciated.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Which are in your opinion the most essential exercises in calisthenics? Give me your idea of a laconic, bare bones regime that despite it's simplicity, it manages hits every major and important muscle groups in the body.

My opinion is: Push ups, squats, neutral grip pull ups, dips, knee/leg raises.

"Hey guys, creating this post to help anyone doing the Ring Rows!  


These coaching cues have helped my clients and I make consistent progress, PAIN FREE. It helps reinforce good posture, as we often sit a lot with rounded shoulders. If you're looking to build a stronger, thicker back, keep these cues in mind!  


🌟 Practice without the rings first - extend your arms out and hold your fists.  
🌟 Think ""shoulders away from ears"" or ""pack your shoulders to your back pockets"". Then think ""squeeze shoulder blades together and open chest"". Try to keep this posture during your set. \*\*  
🌟 When you pull, aggressively pull your elbows back. Imagine someone owing you money but refuses to pay back, and you're elbowing them in the gut! 😤  


\*\* For the aspiring trainer (or smarty pants wannabe like me), this is called scapula depression and retraction, respectively.

"Hi gang,

I’m putting together a new custom routine. Would you mind sharing your thoughts and feedback?

**Some initial FYIs**

• I’m rehabilitating a shoulder injury atm so I’m not going too heavy in my quest for strength skill progressions. Mostly I’d like to keep what I currently have and if I make progress it’s just an added bonus. As such I’m also trying to fix some posture issues which caused my injury by incorporating rows and face pulls.

• I’m focusing a lot on lower body mobility; my hips are incredibly restricted when it comes to tilting for the pancake/forward fold, hence all the pancake work (mostly hinge work). All of this mobility also includes PNF hence no other specific leg work

• My job is pretty exhausting so I need to keep my workouts as time and energy efficient as possible, hence the supersets

**ROUTINE**

Frequency: 3x/week (Mon-Wed-Fri)

**Monday: heavy pull-pancake-core**

A1. Adv. front lever rows 3x6

A2. Straddle good mornings 3x15


B1. Chin-ups 3x7

B2. Seated pancake good mornings 3x15 


C1. Face pulls 3x15

C2. Ab floor slides 3x20


**Wednesday: heavy push-pancake-core**

A1. Tuck planche push ups 3x8

A2. Straddle good mornings 3x15


B1. Wall Handstand pushups 3x6

B2. Seated pancake good mornings 3x15 


C1. Face pulls 3x15

C2. Hanging leg raises 3x12


**Friday: light full body-front and middle splits**

A1. Ring rows (full retraction) 3x12

A2. Split squats 3x12


B1. Dips 3x12

B2. Sumo squats 3x12 (horse stance squats)


C1. Straddle compressions 3x12

C2. Passive stretching for splits


D1. Front splits with PNF

D2. Middle splits with PNF

"This is a question that's already been asked multiple times but with exercises that still feel like you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance.

In my case I'd like to train on off days just for the sake of increasing numbers. Right now I can do about 8 HSPU per 4 sets for **strength**, today I checked and I can only do **36 normal push** ups which is not really that much compared to before I started doing calisthenics. With calisthenics my strength and hypertrophy gains are notorious but it seems I didn't improve in the endurance aspect.

My primary goal is strength and progressing on calisthenics movements (currently pursuing planche and front lever) and endurance comes second.

My endurance goal is to be able to do more normal push ups, inclined pull ups, etc. So, doing something like 2x40 reps of push ups on off days just for the sake of, one day, being able to do 50 reps or more. Will it interfere with my current strength progress? I'm an office worker, I pass 8hr/day in front of the computer and I don't really do any kind of exercise other than my strength routine 3 times a week.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Disclaimer : pardonnez my English, it’s not my native language 

So I’m 18yo and I have a generally healthy lifestyle : I use my bike or I walk when I need to go somewhere, my weight is fine and I have a balanced diet. For a little less than 2 months, I’ve been trying to get in better shape to gain some muscle and also just to feel better physically and mentally. So I started to do some body weight fitness at home because it doesn’t take much time, I don’t need to buy any equipment and as a student it just makes my life easier.

My workout basically consists in alternating series of simple body weight exercices (plank, push-ups, crunches...) for a total of 15min, without pausing. It’s quite intense when I do it but it doesn’t feel like I’m pushing myself beyond my limits.

The problem is that the day after I workout I get really bad muscle soreness to the point where I can’t even walk properly for like 3 days! Then I do another workout and again, muscle soreness for 3 days, then it goes away. My thighs and my abs usually hurt the most. Also the soreness makes me unable to workout more than twice a week, which I don’t think is really effective. 

I’ve tried stretching for a few minutes before working out but it doesn’t really help.

So if you have any advice, wether it’s about preventing soreness or suppressing it, it would be really helpful! Also if you think I’m doing something wrong, please tell me so I can change it","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey guys - I need some advice.   


I'm trying to work on building a functional and broad base of fitness. I've started running every day, but only about 2.5km for the first two weeks and will likely add 500m per fortnight until I reach around 6-7km a day. Along side this however, I'm finding that I finish my run in a park and I still have a bit of time and energy to fit in some resistance training. So;

I want to know if there is some sort of basic full body workout routine that I could repeat, perhaps Monday-Friday mornings after my run, that would give me a basic level of strength. At the moment i'm doing: 

1. Super set of pushups, Australian pullups, and squats - 3x set to 80% capacity (perhaps 12-15 reps each).
2. Super set of chin ups, hanging oblique raises, single leg kickbacks and incline tricep pushup - 2x sets at 70% capacity (perhaps 3-6 chin ups, 5 oblique raises and 10 kickbacks each side).
3. 2-3 minutes of core - V sits, hollow body holds, crunches etc.

I would really love some advice on things i could change or perhaps add to get a more rounded training program. Ideally I'd love to do the same or a similar workout every day along with a run. I travel a lot, and have a pretty varied schedule so I would love something I could just get up in the morning and smash out before my day starts.

I appreciate any advice that anyone can throw my way, or even if anyone could point me in the right direction on where to read more about this. 

Cheers!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I've been doing body weight fitness about 3-4 times per week for about 2 years now. Beginning with youtube videos, after about a year found out myself in a standstill and started to work on my own routine.

Being a dad, 33 years old, found wonderful results coming from a really skinny build to skinny fat and bulking after working out regularly, I have never been in a better shape.

My issue is the ""progressive overload"" term. Doing 5-8 exercises, each 4 sets with variable reps with the last until ""burnout"" keeps giving me pain in the joints(mostly tendons).

How do you guys measure your progression? I find myself often either doing to little or going overboard and my tendons hurting while my muscles being perfectly being able to work out 2-3 days later. Lifting a few more ponds at the gym is waaaay easier to measure then measuring the posture and reps as well as sets with bodyweight.

English isn't my first language, but I really hope you get the context. Cheers!

Really appreciate this community, every time I read the kind comments it really helps to not feel like an idiot when making mistakes :)","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey everyone! Of course I follow the RR. Current progressions are: ring l-sit pull ups 3x5, box HSPU (hands also elevated for ROM) 3x5, ring LFPU 5x3 (feet elevated to shoulder height), tuck FL rows 3x5, pistols 3x5, ab wheel 3x7. 

Routine is solid and I've been progressing well but I am having training ADHD/Fomo about my hinge movement, and stupidly, I've been flip flopping back and forth between KB swings and Nordic Curls. Note: no access to barbells, I understand that they're superior but it's not an option. It's also worth mentioning that my Nordics are weak and require a fair bit of assistance vs. my single 35lb kettlebell that I can swing fairly easily.

I know we like goal based Q&As here but I honestly don't have a strong 'hinge' goal, I just want to clearly outline the better option for my routine and stick with it.

So what's the popular opinion? Get better at Nordics or buy/swing perpetually heavier kettlebells for eternity?

Also, just want to preemptively thank everyone in this sub. It's been infinitely informative, entertaining and satisfying my need to research things into the ground for a very long time now. So thanks!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hi, so I just got into fitness and nutrition recently as I want to lose about 10-12 kilos. I am calorie counting using MFP and aim to eat (as healthily as i can manage) around 1500-1600 calories daily (TDEE 1800) and jump rope 30 mins a day (30 secs on, 30 secs off and repeat 30 times) 3-4 times a week.

But I want to incorporate resistance training to improve strenght and build lean muscle and since I already have calisthenics equipment, I wanted to start resistance training along with jump rope.

The thing is, the RR is very long and I want to do something sustainable long term so I wanted a shorter routine to start out. I plan to do this on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and my jump rope workouts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays with complete rest on Sundays. Please critique this and help me build a good routine:

3×6-12 reps high incline pushups

3×6-12 reps rows

3×6-12 reps squats

3×6-12 reps chair dips

3×6-12 reps lunges

3× 30-60 sec plank holds

"So, I tried ring holds a few weeks ago, and i ended up pinching one of my nerves under my armpits, which took a while to heal, and I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I think it happens on the dismount, but it could also be how I set up my rings. I'd like to continue using the rings because they are so versatile and they are generally fun to use. I tried to look on Google but no one had the same problem I had. I've been working out seriously for a year.

Dismount:

 - I basically dismount very fast, by quickly bending my arms and landing on my feet. this is where the pain comes when i had the pinched nerve

Setup:

 - Rings are set up in my bedroom doorway hung on my pull-up bar.
 - my doorway is about 4-5 inches wider than me (my shoulders specifically).

What I'm trying to ask is, how should i dismount from the rings and is how i set up my rings okay?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I run an Upper/Lower Split that is basically the RR splited in two, but with more volume for legs on Lower days.

For each Upper day, I picked different progressions that allow me to work on different rep ranges.

- One Arm Chin Up progression
- Planche Push Up progression
- Front Lever Row progression
- Ring Iron Cross progression

On Upper 2, medium reps (6-10)
- Archer pull ups
- PPPU
- Archer Rows
- RTO Ring Dips

An lastly, on Upper 3, high reps
- Pull ups
- Push Ups
- Inverted Rows
- Dips

I do 3 sets of each exercise each day.

Does this kind of weekly periodization make any sense?

"Hey all, 

I'm 43 and have a bad back, hips and knees. I'm in some form of pain virtually every day. I try to workout regularly, but my mobility and flexibility are garbage, and there are a lot of things I avoid due to my injuries. My cardio is also nowhere near where I want due to these issues. It's all super frustrating because I have been an athlete all my life, and now there are days that even walking my dogs takes some pushing through. 

I have been to physical therapy many times. I usually come away annoyed and bored. I do yoga sometimes. I like it, but I feel a lack of progress in some areas and some of the positions I simply cannot do.

I started my fitness journey by doing 100 crunches and 2 sets of 45 sec plank. After the first day, my back was sore and it would hurt whenever I would bend to pick up something from the floor/ground. Idk why that is so I did some research on google and there was a harvad study that elucidated that crunches can make your back sore. Then I saw some alternatives to crunches that are easier on your back. However, there are so many people who do crunches every day without worrying about back pain. What do you guys think is the reason for my back pain?. Should I stop doing crunches?.

"We hear a lot about how sitting and other static positions (i.e. standing at a standing desk) create excessive tension in some areas and affect negatively our posture. 

I personally have a sedentary lifestyle, spend 10+ hours working at a computer as a programmer. I have been working out 6 times a week {3 days running, 3 days RR) consistently for more than  3 months and I still feel stiff and inflexible.

I read Move Your DNA by Katy Bowman's where she  talks about the difference between movement vs. exercise. About how we essentially place our bodies in ""captivity"" because what we experience is so far out from what we would in a natural environment (walking on uneven surfaces, looking out onto the horizon, lack of chairs). It resonated a lot and it seems it could be the way out of my stiffness. 

I've tried getting rid of my desk, working while squatting or sitting on the ground, doing stretches while working but it all feels super distracting. I need to focus for long periods of time to get my work done, I can't stop every 25 mins to do stretches. I lose the flow and it's hard to get it back.

Anybody has had similar experiences? Any tips on integrating more movement during the work day without disrupting one's focus?

Thanks a lot!","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"You can just buy $9 drawstring backpack and fill it with rock or sand and use it for push-up and dips and pull-ups etc. I also carry it up and down a hill and hold it in my arm close to my chest and do lunges and calf raises etc.. I’m also doing front raises for deltoids with it as well. 

This backpack is very thick for a drawstring backpack and is holding well with about 50 pounds of rocks in it. I’m away from home for 6 weeks and this and some push-up bars and TRX handles connected to a rope over a tree limb in the back yard are doing wonders. 

You may want to get a few thick heavy duty black trash bags and put them over each other and put them into the back pack and then fill the backpacks with rocks or sand and once filled cut off the excess bag and tie it off. 

I find this backpack is better than a weight vest as I actually hurt my shoulder while doing pull-ups with a weight vest. The loop that goes over the shoulders on the weight vest was very thick and dense and I assume what it did was displace my should and arm where it connects to my body and made me do a pull-up at a not so normal angle and injured my shoulder. With these thick drawstrings you won’t get that. Also, they don’t hurt as much as you might think, the drawstring cord is probably 2/3rds of an inch thick.

"I've been doing ring exercises for a while now. I recently adapted a workout plan I saw on youtube since I kinda did freestyle workouts beforehand. It's been a month since I adapted this new routine:

Sets x Reps

4 x failure | Ring pull-ups

4 x failure | Ring dips

4 x failure | Ring rows

4 x failure | Ring push-ups

4 x failure | Ring T and Ys

4 x failure | Ring bicep curls

4 x failure | Ring tricep extensions


3 minutes rest between each set
If I can't do 4-5 reps before I reach failure, I regress the movement 
(example: ring pull-ups -> band assisted ring pull-ups)

I definitely see improvement size-wise, but I feel like I can't increase my pull-up reps. This isn't the case for the other movements.

I definitely eat enough. I'm not bulking, but I make sure to eat near my maintenance calories and somewhat hit my macros. I'm not a pro and don't plan to be one, so I don't track each gram.

"I spent a number of years trying to increase my metabolic rate while weight training 6x per week and this put me in a great position whereby I could pretty much eat whatever I liked without worrying about fat gain. Pretty much a version of 'you can't out train a bad diet.' Technically you can if you training accordingly. 

I switched over to Recommended routine a year ago and I've started to gain fat and I'm attributing this down to less caloric demand due to only training 3x per week which is half what I used to do. The workout itself is the same. The intensity is just as high, but the frequency is much less. I tried to increase to 6 days, whereby 3 days were recommended routine and the days in between were skill work but the skill work just wasn't intense enough to induce enough caloric demand to match the calorie intake I was on. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this and what they did about it without reducing calorie intake,  because the exercises themselves are tough, no doubt about that, but an attempted and failed handstand on an off day isn't as metabolically demanding as a deadlift or even a set of cable shoulder raises or Barbell curls. 

I'll repeat that I'm not taking about the actual RR. The 6 exercises and core triplet is just as demanding. It's more the days off or 'skills days' which aren't aren't same","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Just wrapped up a year of training on rings and other bodyweight skills.   


I just finished a hypertrophy program but I was at a deficit the entire 12 weeks.   
At the beginning of my training year I weighed 195 then jumped up to 212. After dialing in on a serious program and consistency as well as diet I dropped down to my current weight - 200-202lbs.  


I am debating now if I should be entering a lean bulk or maintenance or perhaps continue back to the cut? Here are my stats;  
Height: 6'2  
Age: 25  
Current weight: 200-202lbs  
BF %: 10-11%  


I would like to see myself sub 10%, I want to get to that 8% range but I have talked to some other gym rats and they suggested to just focus more hypertrophic work on the abs if that's my concern.. which it is. I am also wanting to do the planche program soon, but I am willing to defer that to the future if it conflicts with my aesthetic desires since its a strength based skill.

"I advanced in the horizontal push progression wayy faster than in the other 5 for some reason. I am at 14 pseudo-planche pushups now so I decided to move onto something harder because I'm going hard into the endurance zone already and I train more for hypertrophy and strength. 

I got the idea today to do decline PPPUs and I did about 6 closer to the end of the workout when I was already tired. But what do I do when those become easy too?

Dips, HeSPU, etc. are in the vertical push progressions so they are something different. 

I tried to do archer pushups but I can barely even do one on each side without compromising form by bending my arm (the one which should be straight), or feeling like the elbow of that arm is going to break...

Negative incline one arm pushups are also impossible so far, at least on my couch. 

Another idea I had was working on explosive or clapping pushups. That seems like the best option right now since I'm thinking of getting into freestyle pushups in the future and yet I never feel I can do the form correctly on them. If I explode too much it's hard for me to fall back with my hands in the same place so I end up doing one rep, falling back with the hands too wide/too narrow, getting bank in the pushup position, doing another rep... etc. Is there a solution to this? If I explode too little so that I don't have to stop after every rep to get back into position I'm getting into the 12+ range again. 

The last idea I had was starting the planche progression but I can't even do a frog stand or an elbow lever so I have no idea where to start.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I just recovered from a bout of stress gastritis. Basically for about 6 months, I couldn't exercise and I could only manage to eat about 1000 calories and about 30g protein.

Before this happened, I was 167lbs doing 3x8 chinups and improving. Now I'm 150-ish lbs and I can do 2 strict ones. Pathetic.

I've lurked here for a bit and have done a fair amount of my own research before starting the Recommended Routine. Unfortunately, right when I was getting into it in the fall (had a lot of time off while transitioning jobs) I ruptured my Achilles. 

Recovery has been slow and steady and I can put some weight on the leg now, but I think in general I'll be taking sports or anything with explosive movements off the table for 2022 until I get the confidence in my agility back. 

I'd like to get back into the Recommended Routine, with the caveat being that even exercises that don't directly exercise the leg still involve it in some way (getting up to or down from the pull up bar, contact with ground for push-ups, etc). Cardio is also out of the question for a little bit. My main motivation is looking good for my wedding in September (and of course, being healthier in general). 

Of course I'll be talking to my physical therapist about ramping up my activity level, but I wanted to see if this sub had any thoughts too as it generally seems to be one of the most helpful and supportive places I lurk on this website.

I was shaking and it just made my whole day. 

Now today I went back for my shoulder routine and tried to do a muscle up but couldn't lol. It was funny and sad at the same time😂. I was thinking it's because i trained back yesterday and it's now sore in and recovery. I really hope that's the cause. Also my upper abs feel really sore too from the muscle ups attempts i did yesterday. Could this be the issue? I'll try in a few days again, hopefully I'll be able to get them...😅","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I am in the market for a free standing pull up bar and am looking for something sturdy and stable when doing pull-ups. I will also be attaching rings to it for various exercises.

This one seems like a decent price and will really be all I need.

"Also, if I were to include both, how can I do so?

I plan on strength training with my Olympic dumbbell handles, strongman-designed sandbags, and adjustable kettlebell (12kg to 32kg).

My goal is to get strong for overall life situations (ie: helping to move things, survival, etc), as well as participate in everyday life, hobbies (baseball leagues) and learning materials arts.  

My plan is to use the recommendation routine from the bodyweight Fitness subreddit for upper body (2 to 3 times per week), while using my dumbbells, sandbag and/or adjustable kettlebell for legs and posterior chain. The concern is that I don’t know how to incorporate each tool into my program.

A major concern of mine is that when I competed in high school and college years for baseball, I frequently got hamstring injuries when running the bases, so I know that’s a weakness of mine that I wanna avoid. I hear that RDL isn’t enough to mitigate hamstring injuries, but Nordic Curls and GHR are more effective.

"Hello Guys,

I've been training planche leans for some time now , I have basic strength so I am pretty sure that in strength terms I am strong enough to reach the tuck planche.

For the first time training the planche lean I countered tendonitis in my left hand wrist, I did psychotherapy and I healed completely.

Then for the second time training the planche after 2 weeks I got the same problem.

I know that my wrist are really flexible so I think that the problem might be that I lean forward too much which put my wrist in a position that my tendons cannot hold....

The wrist pain is pretty common one, on my left(weaker) hand left side of the wrist.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"37m here, pretty strong for my size but at the same time, I've always been somewhat skinny-fat. I started doing a bit of greasing the groove 6 weeks ago, mostly for pullups as I want to improve my back strength and posture. Started adding some squat progression in there as well. My main goal behind this is: anything I do is better than doing nothing. So I figured doing a bunch of pullups throughout the day would be a good start. I started with 5x5 and now 5x6, with 3x8 squats to do a bit of leg work.

I know GtG is about increasing reps and I should probably do something more towards RR, but for now, it is ideal as I can do it at work during the day and so far it has been working for me. Perhaps I shouldn't call it GtG, but o well.



However, I'm surprised at the 'toll' it is taking. I can feel it in the muscle soreness but it doesn't feel like I'm doing much. It is only 30+ pullups (sometimes I add a few extra sets if I'm feeling it), and 24 single leg squats. Should I be feeling it that much? Should I increase my protein intake, or general food intake as I suspect I never really eaten enough. Any other general tips are most welcome.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I started thinking that my goal is to be generally healthy which means as long as I do any kind of basic workout program I can achieve 90% of my goal and I'll leave the remaining 10% to the pros where you look at diet macros, specific exercises/timing, etc. As such, the best way for me to workout is when I can enjoy something else with it to maximize my time for the day. So during the morning I created a podcast routine which has things like planks, supermans, mountain climbers, etc that I cant look at a TV for. Then in the evening I have squats, dumbbell work, and other TV exercises. I made a google sheet that has a pivot table that updates in real time anytime I add a new exercise. I thought it was really neat so wanted to share and also see what peoples thoughts were! I do this everyday, alternating A/B with only one set of each to get a lot of different exercises.

"How long did it take to gain a solid strength base?

I know there is no shortcut and I am enjoying the process. Just keen to get some others oerspectives, results and progression stories. 

For example I have been following the RR for the past few months. I have gone from 105kg to 95kg,  not being able to do a single push up and hang onto the pull up bar for a max of 5 seconds, to doing sets of 8 really solid form push ups, 30 second parallel bar holds, unassisted arch hangs and band assisted pull ups. Sets of 8 rows with my feet raised so my body is horizontal starting. Fairly deep box squats (working towards pistols).

I know I still have a fair way to go, as I want to be able to bang out multiple sets of push ups, dips and pull ups, I am still building my base strength. 

How long did it take you to get to a point where you felt pretty strong, and able to do multiple sets of basic variations of all the core exercises (I don't mean the beginner variations such as incline push ups, scapular pulls, I mean basic perfect form push ups, dips, pull ups etc. And do you do skill days now or did you progress onto skill days after having built a solid base.

I know this is all fairly subjective too, just hoping others can share their experiences and discuss","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Bonjour mes amis:

Pretty straightforward question here. I bough some rings and did the RR on them until i could no longer advance more or the exercises started to get a little too creative for my taste (or plainly too hard). Im currently trying BodyByRings routine by FitnessFAQs but i think its not what im looking for: its just pure hypertrophy. Its okay, but not what im into right now.

My target is to learn ring skills: some, normal skills but just on rings: M-Up; L-Sit; proper straight-legged skin the cat; levers, and eventually (not even in the horizon here), the planche.

But i discovered the rings have their own skills and i want to learn them too: shoulder stands, forward roll, iron cross (yeah, i know), among others.

Sounds to me like more ""proper"" ring workout than doing ""normal"" exercises but on rings.

&#x200B;

Where can i find progressions in order to learn those skills ? Are there any routines that that target them ?

Thank you.

Best wishes.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I'm having trouble finding any source material regarding proper programming for adding a weight vest to advanced calisthenics. For reference, I was at 5x20 + 1×20 offhand for one arm push ups prior to a surgery I had nearly a year ago. 

Now my max one arm push ups sans weight vest is about 15—which seems much easier on my body now that I'm older anyway, something about those five extra reps was slowly killing me—but I just can't seem to reincorporate weighted training in any meaningful way like I did in my 20s, when I could just throw on a 40lb vest and hammer out 10 quick one arm push ups. 

Are there any programs/books/YT channels out there involving actual weight vest programming for -advanced- calisthenics? So far all I've found, at best, is maybe Meckanimal and Matteo Spinazzola, but MS isn't really putting out whole programs, and Meckanimal is just barbell + calisthenics. Most other people are less informed deviations of these two, or are just making meme videos for views.

Obviously, with damn near a year of sedentary behavior I'm also incorporating accessory movements such as weighted ab exercises except situps until I get a cinch strap to wrap the vest up like a plate and hold it to my chest (prevents loss of ROM), so if there's not a big six plan available, accessory programming is also useful.

"Hi! So i have been consistently training my Front Lever holds for about a year now and now i am able to hold a Half-lay for about 5s and Full front for about 2-3s with okay form(not perfect).

I am getting abit bored of my routine and i want to switch back to doing weighted sets and reps(pull ups/chin ups)

So i wanted to know if i were to switch back to a sets and reps routine focusing on weighted pull ups(bent arm strength) instead of focusing on straight arm strength. Will i lose my FL progress or will my FL feel better and my holds would increase?



Here are my stats:

Bodyweight: 73kg

Height: 181cm

1rm weighted dips: 35kg

1rm weighted pull: 35kg

FL hold(Full) : 2-3s


Routine im currently doing:

4x2 FL raises 2min

3x3 FL negative 2min

4x3 FL PU 2min

4x6s Band FL hold 2min



Routine that im planning to do if i were to switch to weighted sets and reps(pull):

4x3 Weighted Pull ups(75% 1rm) 2min

3x6 Weighted pull ups(10kg) 1.30min

4x3 FL PU 2min

3x10 BW Pull ups 1.30min

3x12 Australian Pull ups 1.30min

Leg raises/dragonflags

TL;DR: Will my FL holds improve or decline if i were to switch to a bent arm routine?

"It is often said that one should balance the training between pushing and pulling exercises. For example, in Steven Low's book ""Overcoming gravity"", it is stated: ""The simplest method to maintain shoulder structural balance involves utilizing pull and push exercises, which will offset one another. This will allow you to maintain a healthy balance of strength and hypertrophy at the shoulder"".

But what are exactly the consequences of an imbalance, especially doing almost only pushing? Can it be a real issue or is it just a matter of preferences? Or maybe, this push/pull method is too simple and reality is more complex?

I think it is a common imbalance as pushing exercises are easier to put in place: they require no bars or equipment. It can be trained with the floor only.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"Hey all!
I have gotten comfortable with doing 20+ reps of ring push ups (with rings turned out on the top) and i want to move on to a more challenging movement. I am debating whether i should move on to rto push ups or deep ring push ups. My current goal is chest hypertrophy and strength. I also want to put more emphasis on the upper portion of my chest because my lower chest is overdeveloped because of dips.

I heard that the RTO push up stimulates the upper chest more because it has a similar movement pattern to a reverse grip bench press, which is supposedly a good upper chest exercise. On the other hand, I heard that the deep ring push ups are good for upper chest because of increased ROM.

Also, one last question, if i were to perform RTO push ups should i do them with slightly flared elbows if i want to stimulate my chest more?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I'd really appreciate if someone can take a look at my bodyweight squat. I'm concerned that my torso is leaning too far forwards when I squat - I want to make sure I'm not putting my spine at risk.

Here's a set: https://youtu.be/Aw1QiBb9ENk

With my heels lifted on plates my torso is much more vertical, which is what I'd expect good form to look like: https://youtu.be/5Fz88fR3ncc

I thought it could be poor ankle mobility, so I did the ankle dorsiflexion test where see how far you can move your feet from a wall while touching your knees to it, heel planted. I can do it from 8cm away reasonably easily, and from 9cm away with some warmup. According to physio-pedia, this means I have 28.8 to 32.4 degrees of dorsiflexion - not amazing, but shouldn't hold me back either?

I did them again after some ankle mobility work and they looked pretty similar to me: https://youtu.be/REP8rDdb1cI

"I see a few YouTube ""experts"" who think they aren't worth doing but they're commonly used as a staple exercise, at least where I come from. I used to neglect them when I was younger because of this. 

Some people say you may as well just do crunches because the last section is the range of motion is less work but I think it's still different. A crunch, to me, has a similar burn to an isometric, like plank, while the sit up burn feels more similar to  compounds like push ups.

If you ask me I still think the situp is worth doing, especially in combination with other exercises. I like to do them in super sets. For example, I could do deadhang leg raises to lalanne push ups then to situps.

"Hello guys,

I'm 47 and always trained on and off. Some periods with weights and some others bodyweight (and yes, a few years ago I did follow Foundation for more than a year). A little more than a year ago, I was consistently going to the gym, but with gyms opening and closing, I unexpectedly took up running.

I now run pretty much every day (maybe 26 out of 28 in a 4 weeks period) and I'm trying to make sure that I do at least 20 minutes of static stretching per day (I stopped doing it for a few months and I paid dearly in flexibility and I also got some pain in my heels, but now that I'm stretching regularly again things are improving, even though my range of motion is still way less than before starting running).

The result of all of this is that I haven't done strength training in a year. Also, because of bad eating habits, I'm probably 10kg heavier than I should be.

Long preamble to ask for suggestions on how to gradually get back in strength training at home.

I need something doable, because with 45m-1h running every day and stretching every day (and these two are my priorities), if I start a routine that is too demanding is not going to stick. Also, my running program is very varied (different speeds, sprints, intervals, etc...) so I'm not sure that I even need any additional leg work.

I'm looking at the minimalist routine as a good option. What do you guys think? And also, how many times per week and how many circuits would be best in my situation?

"I plan to hike the pacific crest trail, starting from the mexican border this march.

One thing i am concerned about is muscle loss. Most people, when hiking far for months at a time, will inevitably end up in a caloric deficit that will make them lose a ton of weight. This is great if you're overweight, but otherwise you risk cannibalizing your hard-earned muscles to keep yourself going.

I want to take active measures to ~~prevent~~ mitigate this. I would appreciate any and all inputs and thoughts from you all.

So far, this is what im thinking of doing:

* prioritizing high volume of high quality food in my backpack over low packweight.
* forcing myself to eat at least 5000 calories a day on the trail (as a start)
* Doing some basic calisthenics exercises 2-3 times a week to let my body know that i still need those muzzies.
* Working out in gyms when the opportunity arises (towns etc.), using the weigths to get an objective measure of my current strength. 
* Continuously revise my caloric daily intake based on current weight and strength.

Anything else i might consider? And how hard would i need to train to simply maintain under these circumstances?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"This year I hope to keep training strength consistently. As a realistic goal I'm going to hold myself to at least two workouts a week. I lead a really active lifestyle and have a weird work schedule so keeping a good workout schedule is difficult.

I've not been too interested in skills work until recently. I think it would be a good motivator to try to finally get some cool skills down that I've neglected. This year I want to achieve a consistent press handstand. My main obstacle here is going to hamstring flexibility. I've always struggled so much with my flexibility. If I don't consistently stretch I literally cannot touch my toes or hold my legs straight out in front of me, for instance in an L-Sit pull up (which is an exercise I love but always do with knees bent). So mini-goal is hamstring flexibility and mega-goal is press handstand. I don't quite have the shoulder strength but I love pushing and getting that part of the skill will be fun for me.

Next skill goal is a full front lever. I can tuck front lever for around 45 seconds at this point so I think with consistent training here I can achieve a solid few seconds of full front lever by the end of the year.

Finally I REALLY want to get a muscle up. I think I'm really close here. I can bang out deep ring dips and chest to bar pull ups with good form pretty well at this point. I've been trying to train the transition part of the muscle up but it's really a crux move still. I think I need to get a stronger false grip so I'm going to focus on that. I may also be looking to purchase weights for my dips and pull-ups. Anyone have recommendations for products? Should I get a vest or a belt with plates?

He has always been into staying fit but due to getting older,  injuries and lifes daily pull on time,   it drifted from the priority list.   So this year he wanted to make time to reach his goal of 67000 pushups for the year.

He ran into a few snags with his wrists getting sore from some arthritis.  He had to make push up bars to continue and not stress out his wrists.  This made the task more difficult as it is easier to do pushups with your hands flat.  It did not stop him,  he persevered and exceeded his goal.

"Hi there, I got interested in bodyweight fitness because of the skills you can learn. Currently I am aiming to learn handstands and muscle ups however I do not wish to neglect other areas of my body so I designed a push pull core(+legs) routine for myself. 

I spent few months bodybuilding so I have fair amount of strength for my body weight, benching more than I weight etc. I also noticed that bodyweight excercises are somewhat limited when it comes to legs so I will do weighted squats and leg machines for legs. 

The routine I came up with is based of the spreadsheet that my friend sent me from this sub (looks somewhat like a talent tree). I have main excersises followed by a ""-"" indicating things that I can do to make it harder or to diversify for the day. Also I start with the most advanced movement then move down to the simple one, for example I do archer pushups -> incline pushups -> regular pushups, etc. 

Routine: https://imgur.com/a/yYjAX9k

So far I've spent 2 days doing the workout. Please provide feedback since I am not sure if it is designed well.

Stats: 74kg (~163 lbs), 183cm (6ft)

Thanks in advance.

Edit: I aim for failure being around 8-12 reps then move down to a simpler progression to keep going till failure again.

Edit: 3 sets for all.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"
"I do three types of workouts: strength, volume and intensity. Strength = very low reps, high rest, volume = medium reps, lots of sets through the day, and intensity = 1-hour HIIT/cardio.

After the first two I get the usual DOMS starting ~24 hours after the workout, which seems absolutely normal.

However, after intensity workouts I am experiencing a very different thing: moderate, but uncomfortable that seems to be located in muscle attachments (e.g. I did arms yesterday, and it is located just over the elbow both for the biceps and triceps, before the main muscle tissue). It begins much earlier (next day), and strengthens significantly when extending the muscle.

I just wanted to understand if that is normal, or if I take it too intensive.

Thank you in advance.","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

"I suffered a shoulder disclocation, from an assault 6 months ago.

I was doing quite well in my calsithenics exercises, getting pretty close to front lever and straddle planche, so the setback was tough.

I skipped surgery and decided to rehab.

It took about 4 months before i could do a one arm scap pull in the injured  / rehabbed shoulder.  unfortunately it got injured again playing tennis and it took another 2 months to get back to this level.

the reason for this post is to show when you are recovering from injury, your results and performance can be misleading and you need to pick the right benchmarks.

as you rehab you need to keep moving your benchmarks forward, and if you cant, you need to re-evaluate  your injury and why your arent progressing.

now im over this benchmark i will look for another one to contniue my rehab progress in the right direction

"I'm an enthusiast in both sports, and i'm currently running a more like powerbuilding split and i want to blend calisthenics into a it (even if it means sacrificing some of the building part). Any tips on how to?

To add more context. I'm not competing in powerlifting, it's just to get stronger in the 3 lifts and in calisthenics my goals are all about handbalancing,  I already do weighted pull-ups and weighted dips and sure i wouldn't mind being able to do a front lever or a muscle-up, but handstands, l-sits, planches and all the handbalancing variations are my main goal on this. I'm 171cm (\~5'7) and 67kgs (\~148lbs) in a decent shape, but really unflexible (can´t touch my toes and doesn't have a good shoulder overhead mobility). So how can i add handstand and l-sit training to my routine?

Edit:  I do one week more powerlifting focused (4 days: squats/ohp, deadlift/bench press, squats/weighted dips, bench press/deadlifts) and one week more ""building focused"" (4 days of upper lower split) where i still do the big 3 (but a lighter and with more reps then the week before) and do more accessory lifts.

"Hello dear reddit.

I am an intermediate lifter. I transitioned to rings today and I decided to use the rings mainly for upper body I am keeping the barbell for my legs for my workouts.

Today I went out (-5c yay for my courage) and I tried the rings. Now I want to ask because im worried I didn't do enough. I did 1 set of 10 push ups on the lowered rings, after that I could only pull 5 push ups on the second set. I lowered the difficulty and I managed to do 70. After that I managed to do 70 rows. The first set was on the hardest difficulty and the rest were sets of 5s because I couldn't do more. I have to say that the pain and exhaustion is amazing compared to lifting. 

Was my sets of 5s wrong to do? I tried to rest as much as possible. I just couldn't do 1 pull up (I can do around 6 or 7)  and I gave up and left. Is this normal? I thought I could do pull ups, push ups and rows together in 1 workout but after finishing push ups and rows I was destroyed. Any ideas on how to be able to do all together?","bodyweightfitness,fitness"

Hello everyone, the problem is the title, but let me give a little background.

Most of my company is based out of Europe and India, and I am the only “onshore” resource learning this stack. We have several federal agencies who use the stack who need assistance with… who knows what, but you have to have a clearance and access to military bases, which I have. All in all, I am conveniently placed where I am. 

Except, currently I am a program manager for a completely non-technical group within the company. I have very little technical background *(I’ve got tons of html/css experience… but then again, who doesn’t? My 7 year old knows html…)*, and from my google-fu, it appears I need to have some OOP experience to be successful. Oops…

We’re (a group of 30 of us from around the world) all being provided the self-guided training, which is nearly $2000 per person, but I worry that I will still lack the requisite skills to be successful. 

I am an exceptional learner, and anything I start learning I can typically excel at, but, I don’t even know where to get started here. So, I am seeking Reddit’s help!

"So, I had been studying the Odin project and making some progress. I had went a little far in JS and it would say I was getting it. Then life happened. I stopped studying for months. I don’t remember most of what I had learned so I’m starting all over again (intentionally just to relearn in case I had missed some things the first time). 

I just finished the command line lesson and it makes more sense now. I got excited when I finished the assignment. I remember what had made me show interest in coding in the first place. That excitement in the end when I get stuck and figure out what the problem is and how I fixed it. 

I worked in a Call center. I remember before starting, I was excited because I wanted to talk to different people, help them, be happy I had fixed someone’s problems but the reality was completely different. I figured some people are entitled jerks, and it was not even about helping them, the whole job was about stupid metrics, and selling crap people may need or not need. Genuinely caring and trying to help people, or fixing the issue didn’t matter. Just the often unrealistic targets. I hated it after a while, and I’ve told myself, never again.

Is it “fun” where you actually code/debug and see the result of your work and feel accomplished or is it just a bunch of crappy metrics, unrealistic targets and dumb things that have nothing to do with being a software developer?

Question 1: The basic programming courses in my uni are done with C#/C++/Java. Will I waste my time doing any of these, or should I find alternative courses elsewhere that deal with Python straight away?

Question 2: I want to gather data from a website, specifically prices of used cars. I can see these in the source code of the webpage. I'd want to automate gathering of this data. Is this something I can do efficiently with Python? Some other programing language? What kind of level of skill would this require?

Our repository is hosted on GitHub, and we use git actions to deploy to our environments, as well as using variables within those .yaml files to tag the image with a specific release number.

As I am looking at the PR into our master branch, I don't necessarily know (or can't easily figure out) what all we piled into this release.

I am 30 years old, I am from Argentina, I am studying a three-year career related to software development where they prepare you for fullstack web development in .net mostly.

I've done a few hours of freecodecamp tutorials and exercises, and I'm currently almost halfway through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy.

Do not know.  

The point is that I'm rethinking what to do, whether to insist and finish the bootcamp or look for other variants. Is it really necessary to have a design instruction to work the front end? Maybe I should consider focusing only on the backend?

Let's say I have a script connected to a websocket that receives data each few ms, it analyzes it, checks some conditions, and then it calls an API endpoint if conditions are met. Now, this works for one single user, but how would I expand that for multiple users?

For E-Commerce platforms, what APIs do you guys use for calculating shipping rates? I'm building an e-commerce site for a print shop and they have products of various sizes and weights so I'm looking for something that can seamlessly calculate shipping for such products. Additionally, they outsource some jobs to a larger print company so they are not able to provide a direct price for such jobs, much less the cost to ship either to the shop or to the customer directly, so in such cases, how would you handle such a situation in which you can't directly provide a price? I was thinking maybe if a product is selected (or particular production options), instead of giving the direct price and providing the checkout option, it would turn into a workflow where a quote is requested and a price is given back via an automated email within the hour or next business day if after hours, but wanted to see what you guys have used in such cases.

"A year or two ago, I started becoming interested in learning c++. Not really seriously, just for a hobby. I fantasized and wrote a top-down game out for fun while I was learning the very basics.

If I wanted to fully commit to making my 2d top-down game, what actions and steps should I make? I want to casually make my own game, not pump out games for a company so its nothing too serious. 

Would a coding camp be good? Or would learning it in a college setting be better? Like I said, it's nothing serious so I was thinking about minoring in game design; I'm thinking about going back anyway but I'm really wary about whether or not I'd be able to do it. 

The reason I'm asking is I'm more of a hands on learner. I learn better from actually doing it and having in person instructions then self teaching.

 Does anyone have advice for me?","learnprogramming,programming"

"Hello, I've been learning backend development with Nodejs and app dev with flutter for a couple months now. Recently I was approached by an entrepreneur who offered me some amount to build an app for him. It's basically an app where people can register for a service like plumbing, electrican, mechanic and related with some features like payment through UPI and Card and app to app voice conversation. 

While it seems feasible to me with the stuff that I've learned in flutter and Nodejs. But I can't seem to shake this feeling that some way in, I would get absolutely stuck and won't be able to do anything about it. 

So i just wanted to get you guys' opinions. Do you think a beginner such as me can make an app with help from a couple of friends who are all beginners in 30-40 days. Or should I deny the project and practise on a few solo projects first before working on any professional apps. 

How did you guys do when you first made your apps?? I'm not a beginner developer as I do have some experience. Just a beginner in full stack app development.

"I'm having a hard time understanding why creating a variable and assigning a class to it is done the way it is.

For example say I want to assign the class ""XmlFile"" to a variable, every tutorial I have seen tells me to write it like this:

XmlFile xmlFile1 = new XmlFile();

But I'm not understanding why the line is structured the way it is.  what is the point of writing XmlFile before the variable name and then also assigning it to that variable on the right side of the equation?

The only thing I can think of that seems similar in structure is when you create a variable in Powershell with a cast on it, for example:

\[string\]$fileName = $null

so your creating the variable $fileName which is being cast as a string type

but why would you need to cast a variable as the class that you are assigning to it, shouldn't it automatically just become the class object when you assign it with new XmlFile(); ?

I guess this begs the question, are there other things I can write in front of the variable name and still set it as a class on the right side?

Or, there is a url to link a page based on parameters href=""page\_name.php?source=page\_edit&toss\_coin=witcher"". If the site is going to be blah.com, will those links not have to accommodate that? blah.com/page\_name.php?source=and-so-on

"Hi, please help me with this problem.

I have to do a fork tree based on the following code and to write the return values for each process. The latter is the most problematic thing for me.


1)            if (fork()) {
2)               fork();
3)               if (fork()) {
4)                   return 1;
5)               }
6)            } else {
7)               if (fork()) {
8)                   fork();
9)                   return 2;
10)              }
11)              return 3;
12)           }
13)            return 4;




I think I managed to do the tree, but I think I don't understand the return values.
So... in the first if statement we are in the parent process (let's say P0), in the else statement we are in the child (P1). Then in the parent process we call fork (row2) which creates a child process (P2) from P0 and then 2 processes are created in row 3 - P4 from P2 and P3 from P0. These 2 processes (P3 and P4) return 1 to their parent processes P2 and P0... right?

Then in the else statement which is for P1 we call fork (row 7) and it creates a child (P5) and then the next fork (row 8) creates a process from the parent P1 (or not???, let's call it P6). Then idk what happens with return 2, 3 and 4. Someone told me that P1 gets the return 2, but also P6 without P5 which gets the return 3. And return 4 goes to P3 and P4? Is this right and why? Pls explain. xD","learnprogramming,programming"

"Quick read:
I'm 23 years old in the UK, currently enrolled on a software development bootcamp until the end of March and want to purse a career in CS.
Should I continue self teaching, or look at the other options once the bootcamp ends? 


Hi all, I'm a 23 year old male from the UK and I'm looking to pursue a career in computer science. 

A brief background about myself,
I've been working from home for about 6 years now (Nothing related to CS), and during that time I was often coding just for entertainment. I focused on Java, but also tried a few other languages (Python, C#(game dev), SQL, HTML & CSS), and I've found that it's just what I love doing. 

Over the last 6~ months, I have decided to pursue CS as a career and actually began the learning process. 
So, I entered a software engineering bootcamp at the beginning of January and it's helped massively already.

The bootcamp mentioned that after completion, we'd receive about 6 months assistance with finding work
But I don't think it's likely that I'd find a job within those 6 months, so I want to be prepared with my next steps.
(The bootcamp is only 2 days per week)

My main question here is, once this bootcamp has finished (End of March~) should I continue learning by myself, or look into College/University? 

I'm currently leaning more towards College/University as I'm only 23 and will have no other commitments, but wanted to get some other opinions.","learnprogramming,programming"

sudo apt install -y git zip unzip openjdk-8-jdk python3-pip autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libtinfo5 cmake libffi-dev

The next command:

It failed by not doing anything.  I press ""enter"", the cursor goes to the next line and that's it.  After a while, the cursor stops blinking.  I'm allowed to type more stuff and press enter.  But this just enters into the next line.  No command is called. It sort of freezes but not really.

If I exit, the window warns, ""There is still a process running in the terminal. Closing the terminal will kill it.""

But even if I wait an hour ""pip3 install --user --upgrade cython virtualenv"" doesn't do anything.

I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this.  I tried  closing, restarting terminal, then make simpler commands like ""pip3 install cython"" but that runs into the same failure. I thought about completely closing Ubuntu and restarting that.  But I'm not sure how much I'd have to redo if I did that.","learnprogramming,programming"
"Greetings people,

so I stream every now and then on Twitch and I already started working on my own Python Chat Bot. Now I want to integrate the Bot into my Stream overlays.

"Hi there! 

So, I’m currently studying computer science at a community college and I’ve opted to learn C++. Our programming classes are divided into 3 parts. 

1. Fundamentals ( basics ) 
2. OOP
3. Data Structures and Algorithms.

Yesterday was my first C++ lesson. I’ve never programmed before, though. 

Right now I’m planning to make use of most of my time with aim to learn C++ effectively. 

I plan to understand the coding structure with leetcoding-type questions, as soon as I’m done with one subtopic of C++. 

Eg variables and inputs-
Then solving topical questions 

Conditional statements-
Then solving topical questions.


I had 3 questions in my mind:

Q1) To those who have solved leetcode questions - code puzzling questions, does the above plan sounds achievable through solving easy questions only? 

Q2) are there any resources where I can get topical code-puzzling questions? 

I know, I may sound too stubborn about it. Its just I’m a project-based learner. 

Q3) are there any C++ projects that doesn’t require “basics, OOP, DS&amp; A” all 3 as prerequisites to be built? 

Thank you for reading all of the above.

I'm working on an e-commerce site in django. I have the main picture and below it im trying to make a horizontal, scrollable slider of the rest of the pics of the product. I have my two buttons on each side(actually just clickable divs) and in between, I want the pictures. So, because I want the pictures horizontal, and I want the div containing all the pics to fill the area between the two buttons, I want to use ""display: flex;"". But when I do that, it makes all of the parent containers grow. The main picture gets huge and obviously,  not that cool. I have applied a ""max-width"" to every single parent container, and the flex div itself, but it still grows and pushes everything wide. Because I want it to scroll, I have to be able to have more pictures than the div is wide. Will set overflow to hidden and then have my buttons scroll. So basically, I'm asking how I can contain a flexible div(or any type of container) within a certain size. It obviously doesn't have to be a flex container but flex makes things horizontal by default and has all the other features I would want to apply.

"Ever since I started learning to program I have been annoyed by this thought that one can always go deeper. I program in Python but can't help thinking on a daily basis that is Python just made in C which is then made in assembly or similar. While programming or reading about programming in python I can get lost in thinking about how specific things work on a deeper level. Like how will the compiler knows in what order to handle x, y and z and how the text in a python file ends up being machine code - all the way down to how the electricity runs, etc.

This, unfortunately, works a bit like perfectionism for me and therefore takes up a lot of mental space and removes some of the joy of programming. It can feel strongly unsatisfactory to me to work in a programming language and just have to accept that things are just done a certain way. At the same time, I'm aware that a lot of things in modern society are super complex and we just can't understand everything in a detailed way. There's something different though about programming because it is all about breaking problems into smaller parts and understanding them.

Of course, there's some passion behind these thoughts and the endless wondering about inner workings can be very interesting as well!

"As the title says, I'm looking to mentor 1 or 2 students trying to enter into the tech industry. 

**My background:**

I work at a FAANG (now MANGA) company as a software engineer. I don't have a CS degree, but I do have a business-related degree from a top 50 school. 

While I'm happy to talk about things like data structures, algorithms, system design, etc., I want to focus on the parts of starting a career which aren't mentioned so much. How to communicate with coworkers, talking your ideas out with others, and how to approach interviews. If there are other topics you're looking to cover, let me know what they are and I'll likely be happy to oblige.

**Who I'm looking for:**

Someone who's looking to start their first career. You can be in college, but you don't have to be. You should have some experience; if I ask you basic data structure questions, you should be able to answer! You don't need to have an in-depth understanding of how hashing algorithms work, but understand what a linked list is, or how efficient arrays are in big-O terms. If you're not totally certain if you have this experience, please do send me a message anyway and I can decide for myself.

I will verify my identity/employment status with the 1-2 people I mentor. 

**How to apply:**

Leave a comment or send me a private message. The more detail you provide, the more likely I am to get back to you!

Thanks everyone, I'm looking forward to working with some of you :)

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who sent me a message or commented, I received over 500 messages. I have found 3 great people to help mentor!

"I used Faceapp's 'face swap' feature to swap a face in a painting with my own. I think that, in carrying out the face swap, the software has flipped the painting's face around (as the left eye of the painting looks like the right eye of the composite image, and vice versa). My friend thinks the software has kept it the right way round (so that the left eye of the painting corresponds to the left eye of the composite image). She said we could prove it one way or another by doing a Fourier transform on the images to compare them, but won't do it herself. I'd like to do this, not just to prove a point but because I've seen research papers in my field talk about Fourier transforms and I'd like to learn to do them.

A bonus would be if the table can also be filtered interactively.

"Hello, kinda dumb question here. I have recently become more interested  on computers and technology as a whole and wanted to learn more about  it.

"I did a coding test that had minesweeper problem. I instantly thought of graphs and breadth first search. They give me a 2D array like so 

    [
    [false, true, true]
    [true, false, true]
    [false, false, true]
    ]

and an x,y coordinate that the player clicks. It is guaranteed that clicked point is not a bomb. I am to return a new array that tells you how many bombs are in the clicked points surrounding 8 neighbors. True represents a bomb so for the middle clicked point I would return 

    [
    [-1, -1, -1]
    [-1, 5, -1]
    [-1, -1, -1]

"Hello fellow computer folks,

I am using Tesseract ocr to extract data from documents and i noticed that, according to youtube, there should be a way to tell tesseract where to look for certain data.

At the moment, im just scanning the whole document, then i store the recognized stuff in a list and search for certain buzzwords with some methods i wrote. 

This approach, to me, seems a little caveman-like and the result is extremely dependant on high ocr confidence, because i am literally just doing the following for most of the data since regex is not a solution here:

1. Find index of buzzword
2. See if some item in the list around the found index fits a cheap description (length = x, hast letter/digit,...)
3. Take item that fits description 

This kinda works if tesseract gets the text in the right order, but as soon as data is at a different place than it is expected,
this approach obviusly fails.

I am using the c# wrapper from Charles Whels and i cant find anything regarding this topic that isn't in python or using the comandline.

My first guess would be to cut the image into tiny rectangles and then just scan those, but i have like 55+ independent entries and multiple document types, where the data is differently distributed and they all have different formats.
So...this would be a pain in the ass.

Please let  me know if you have a better way of accomplishing this.

Thx in advance.","learnprogramming,programming"

"Hello everyone!

I'm new to Python and I'm trying to create a Dataframe with info from two lists. I'm really stuck with this thing.

Let's say I have the following lists:

    list1 = ['abc 1', 'abc 2', 'abc 3', 'abc 4']
    list2 = ['zzz 1 zz', 'zzz zz 2', 'xxx 2 xx', 'zzz zz 4', 'yyy 4 yy']

I need to get Dataframe where the first column consists all elements of the **list1**, and each row of the second column consists those elements of the **list2**, that have the same number as in the cell on the left in the first column. Here's the result that I want to get:

    	column1	    column2
    0	abc 1	    zzz 1 zz
    1	abc 2	    zzz zz 2, xxx 2 xx
    2	abc 3	    NaN
    3	abc 4	    zzz zz 4, yyy 4 yy

To get that Dataframe I created it:

    column_names = [""column1"", ""column2""]
    df = pd.DataFrame(columns = column_names)
    df.column1 = list1

And I don't know to fill the second column correctly. I tried this:

    info = []
    for i in list2:
        for j in df.column1:
            if j.split(' ')[-1] in i:
                info.append(i)
                joined_info = ' '.join(info)
                df.column2 = joined_info

Or this:

    info = []
    for i in df.column1:
        for j in list2:
            scanning = False
            if i.split(' ')[-1] in j:
                scanning = True
                continue
            else:
                scanning = False
                continue

"Hello World ;p

&#x200B;

After fiddling with C# (my first programming language) for about 2 months and getting a good grasp on the basics, I intend to solidify and further develop my skills with my first project. 

&#x200B;

I already have an idea for a website I want to build, with desired core functionalities being written down. Since the vast field of programming is somewhat disorienting for a novice like me, I'd appreciate if you could provide me with some pointers / keywords regarding skill acquisition and technologies (languages, frameworks etc.) for the following purpose, as you see fit:

&#x200B;

I plan on creating a site for advertisement of some kind. I assume the technical needs for this archetypes are up to some level comparable, and involve things like data management and security.

&#x200B;

I intend this to be accompanied by a mobile app which can amongst other things share your location.

As I understand, C# isn't necessarily the best suited tool for this purpose, and as already alluded to, I know that many different components go into the creation of one website / project. I'm not at all averse to learning new languages, but a solution with an opportunity for a practical application of my newly acquired skills would clearly be favoured.

&#x200B;

I also considered starting with a dating app, since these share a lot of the functionalities I intend for the app-half of the laid out project, and it would probably be more manageable than to gun for the crossfunctionality from the get-go; your thoughts on this point would be appreciated as well.

" Suppose we have three Bear objects: momma, poppa, and baby. We create a ""bears"" ArrayList and add pointers to the three bears to the ArrayList.

    // Create three bears 
    Bear momma = new Bear();
    Bear poppa = new Bear(); 
    Bear baby = new Bear(); 
     
    // Create an ArrayList, add the three Bear pointers 
    ArrayList bears = new ArrayList();
    bears.add(momma); 
    bears.add(poppa);
    bears.add(baby); 

The above code produces the memory structure shown in the document.

Notice that the line bears.add(momma) does not add a copy of the momma Bear object to the ArrayList. Instead, it just adds a pointer to the momma Bear object to the ArrayList. It is common in Java to have such ""shallow"" pointers to an object – there is one object with many pointers spread around pointing to it.

For memory structure please refer to the diagram on page 3 of the document given below:

[Document](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs108/cs108.1082/106a-java-handouts/HO49ArrayList.pdf)

My doubts,

1)Can someone explain what the above paragraph is trying to say?

2) What is the meaning of shallow pointer in java as stated in the document?

3) what is exactly stored in the ArrayList. In the image showing the structure, it is shown that there are two pointers to each element in ArrayList.

From my knowledge, ArrayLists can only store reference variables to objects. However, what is the pointer that points from inside the blocks in the ArrayList. 

What is it that is stored in ArrayLists?","learnprogramming,programming"

I then thought that maybe the code was only run when someone actually visited the webpage, so I logged onto it and waited a minute for it to update and refreshed, but it was still showing yesterday's data. The only way I could force it to update was to restart the dyno. So I was just wondering if someone could please explain why this was and what the logistics are of the code actually running, as it looks like it's just not dynamically running anywhere and also runs when you first boot up the dyno.

    You are given an array of positive integers numbers, and a positive integer x. 
    Your task is to find the number of ways that x
    can be obtained by writing pairs of integers in the array numbers
    next to each other. In other words, find the number of pairs (i, j), such that i ≠ j, and xis the concatenation of numbers[i] and numbers[j].

\---

    For numbers = [1, 212, 12, 12]  and x = 1212 the output should be 3. 
    
    Because concatenating 
    
    numbers[0] + numbers[1] = 1212
    
    numbers[2] + numbers[3] = 1212
    
    numbers[3] + numbers[2] = 1212

"I’m 35 and I’ve been working in the game industry as a 3D Artist / Art Director for 12 years. I don’t have a degree (got thrown off track by cancer at 20), but I did study at a Uni+community college+self-taught and was skilled enough to find work without it. I’ve been at my recent job for about 7 years now and there’s a chance it could be ending in another year-ish. While it’s been great and I feel I’ve done well, I work in a small team, I wear ALL the hats and think I’ve become diluted in my skill sets and worry I may be very limited in job options. I also don’t need to stay in games necessarily and hope I'm more likely to find stable, better paying work with 40 hour weeks in other industries. 

I’ve learned a decent amount of C# in Unity (game engine) for fun and really enjoy it. I’ve used it to write tools to assist the art pipeline, created code-driven art and have attempted to make some games. Also written shaders. I think I actually enjoy code more than art so I plan to sink all my time into learning enough for an entry level position. I’m confident in my ability to self-teach and hope I can find decent work without a degree, though I can consider getting it if the competition is too steep now.

If I’m aiming for SWE, should I stick with just C#? I learned some JavaScript prior to C# and it was easy to switch at the time - seemed pretty similar. Is there anything else I should focus on now that could give me a broader chance for any kind of entry level?

"Hi there, few days ago I posted here a doubt and the replies helped me a lot but now I have another... I need to make my Python assignment as oop as possible per lecturer request. Its a menu driven application that has seven menus that are nested. The intention is to have 3 classes, one for data, one for behaviou and one for logic. The logic one is not done yet but the other two are working as expected

I need to make 7 menus, that will be nested.

MenuItem class have 7 methods with one dictionary containing the text of that menu

like this, but each menu have different options

       def gen_main_menu(self):     
    self.general_main_menu = {""1"": ""Administer Event"",
                              ""2"": ""Register to Event"",
                              ""0"": ""Exit Application""}     
    return self.general_main_menu 

the Menu class call the dictionaries from MenuItem and displaying them on the console like this

     def create_general_menu(self):     
    for key, value in self.gen_main_menu().items():         
    print(key, value, sep="": "") 

so far so good... both classes do exact what they are supposed to be doing, but one version call all methods inside the Menu \_\_init\_\_ like this

    class Menu(MenuItem):
    
        def __init__(self, general_menu, admin_main=None, admin_theatre=None, admin_concert=None, customer_main=None, customer_theatre=None, customer_concert=None):

            admin_theatre,admin_concert, customer_main,
            customer_theatre,customer_concert)

and the other call no method at all like this

    class Menu(MenuItem):

            MenuItem.__init__(self)

## Problem Statement

Given an **N** number of lists, return the set of **n** lists that contain the most number of common elements.

## Example (in Python)

Suppose I have 10 lists:

    list0 = [1, 22, 8, 3, 15, 5] 
    list1 = [8, -1, 16, 19, 31, 1, 4] 
    list2 = [1, 19, -1, 8, 4, 11] 
    list3 = [-2, 19, 4, 5, 6, 15, -3] 
    list4 = [18, 21, 2, 30] 
    list5 = [5, 4, 3, 19, 22, 6, 8] 
    list6 = [1, -1, 31, 19, 0, 9, 4] 
    list7 = [22, 1, 3, 5, 8, 0, 16] 
    list8 = [8, 22] 
    list9 = [4, 19, 14, 25, 22, 27, 1]  
    
    lists = [list0, list1, list2, list3, list4, list5, list6, list7, list8, list9] 
    
    def common_lists(lists: list, n: int):     
        pass 

* When `n = 2`, `common_lists` returns `(list1, list6)` since they share `-1, 1, 4, 19, 31`
* When `n = 3`, `common_lists` returns `(list0, list5, list7)` since they share `3, 5, 8, 22`
* When `n = 4`, `common_lists` returns `(list1, list2, list6, list9)` since they share `1, 4, 19`","learnprogramming,programming"

My feeling is that there is a ton of data out there to be had, and the patient-facing folks are not often exposed to all of the data that they could be using to make better care decisions. I do not believe this is the fault of the doctors and nurses, it's more of a rift in understanding and capability; you have the people that are great at understanding the human body and helping other people when they're sick, and each of these people have a lot of data associated with them, like medical history, pre-existing conditions, genetics, symptoms, diet, etc. The doctors and nurses are more focused on each of these things, but if we were to zoom out a bit and take all the data from one person and agglomerate it with the data from others, maybe we could begin to tease some further information out of these things. Perhaps diet, location, and all the other information could be used to identify a certain situation in which people were at higher risk of a type of disease or illness, maybe we could understand more about what causes it, or how to treat it.

"Hello all,

I'm working on a task where I have to map incoming JSON messages to a different schema and enrich them with additional fields. All of this is done in Java. I'm struggling with coming up with the best solution to model the data, the parsing and enrichment methods though. Currently I have a couple of classes that describe the data eg. User, Users, Event. Those classes follow the Builder Pattern.

The question is what design approach would be good for such task. Should I keep the data model classes? Should I use the builder pattern to keep them immutable or should I first create the object and then update the fields that are populated by the database call in another method?

Any help or resources regarding good designs for such issues would be appreciated.

    public String parseUserData(ObjectNode input) {
      User user = new User.Builder(""some-user-id"")

I've got an array of records that I want to refresh. I need to clear it first so that I don't simply add the updated records to the old records. Inside the function `getCurrentRecords()` I've used `fetch()` and several chained `.then()` blocks to get data from the server and update the array. As shown above, if I log `records[]` to the console, the updated records display as expected. However, if I try to log a single record I get undefined. If I clear the array inside of a `.then()` block within the `getCurrentRecords()` function the problem is resolved.

If the array has already been updated when `console.log()` is called, how can its individual values not yet be readable?","learnprogramming,programming"

"Hello all, I graduated with a CS degree in May, and have been looking for work for several months now. In that time, I have also been working on numerous personal programming projects to build both my programming skills and also my portfolio. So far, all of my significant projects have been in Java; with each project, I've tried to learn a new technology and/or be more ambitious with regards to the project's complexity. So far, I've learned how to work with JSON files, used Apache POI to work with Excel files, and am now using MySQL to design and implement my own database (using JDBC to interact with it). Between projects, I have also been programming common/essential algorithms in Python to practice the language (so far I've done Binary Search and Merge Sort). 

My question is, what should I learn next? My goal is to be a back end/Java developer, so I'm thinking of diving into Spring and possibly learning the essentials of front end as well, with the end goal being designing a website that uses Spring for its back end. However, I also think that since I already have some experience in Python (my course on algorithms was mostly taught in Python), the language generally seems easier to interview in, and there are also a lot of opportunities available for entry-level Python developers, it might be more worthwhile to develop some  personal projects in Python that I could add to my portfolio.

Pointers and references I learned in my programming class last year but was rusty so just did some brief review on how they work, whereas I never learned much about const or static variables.  

From what I read so far, a static variable is a variable where a change in its value will persist outside the scope where the change was made.  That sounds like the same thing that passing a non static variable by reference accomplishes.  So is making a variable static really just telling the compiler to always pass it by reference ""under the hood""?  If so, why ever bother with doing a manual pass by reference?

TL;DR - I'm from Hawaii, I'm not happy with my job, I want to learn programming and want to try a bootcamp, but before I do that I wanted to do some solo study and have found it to be very daunting :\[.. so I'm hoping to find some peers who I can learn along with or learn from.  


I'm just some 33 year old guy from Hawaii who's not happy with his current career and I feel like I'm at this stage in my life where I either do something about it now or be stuck in my current job for life.

  
When I was younger and in college I had wanted to pursue computer science but I had to drop out, fast forward 10 years later I'm working full time with a mortgage and I make enough money to get by.. but I find little to no fulfillment at my job.

  
I contemplated going back to school full time for Comp Sci but with my work schedule and mortgage it wasn't feasible in terms of time or finance.               

Then someone advised me to attempt a coding bootcamp, something i've never heard of before but it seemed to open up a door for me, something that I could manage financially and with a time window that I could possible work with..  Before jumping in I wanted to do some self studying and have found it both fun.. and difficult.  One of the advice that I keep seeing pop up is to find a community or find peers to learn along with so basically that's what I'm hoping to find here!

It was my 2nd semester of CS & I never wrote a single line of code before college. We were building a game using C# / Unity. The idea of it was a 3D maze where you collected items while avoiding or killing enemies with various weapons you were given. So like Pac-Man with a gun. 

We had 3 project check points in the semester & my project scored high 90’s on the first two. They built on each other using new programming skills gradually like inheritance/polymorphism for example.

The last version of our project dealt with file IO so saving the state of our game to continue later as well as updating a high score leaderboard & saving the scores for future reference.

This was the death of my project. As a little freshman I procrastinated a bit knowing I had a high A in the course already & when it came down to the final week I was struggling & nearly in tears at some point. I think ended up building the leaderboard UI & saving a score while the game was running but never had it functional enough to see the scores when restarting the game. 

In the end the grade for check point 3 wasn’t in line with previous grades & it dropped me to a B for the course. It’s one of those courses where I look back & realize I could’ve easily gotten that A with a little more effort & asking someone for help.

You're given the values n and m (min and max length of a piece), the length of the string and the number of 1s in the string.

Made a post here recently about how often y’all code outside of work, but I also have another burning question in mind that may prove to be a valuable discussion for us devs.

If I can be frank here, I make $70k as Jr. Software Developer at my first ever dev job. I’ve been with the company for 3 months and so far it’s been a great learning experience and I enjoy the people I work with everyday.  

I live in a HCOL area, so I know I’m probably being underpaid but I’m okay with it because 1.) this salary is more than most people dream of having, so I’m trying my best to stay humble, and 2.) I needed to get my foot in the door and gain experience.

At the same time, we all know our worth as developers and certainly don’t want to remain where we are forever (unless you’re absolutely happy with where you are).

Questions are: How soon should I ask for a promotion and how much should I ask to be paid? How often should you expect to be promoted as a software developer? 

Your thoughts?

"So I just started learning from [automatetheboringstuff.com](https://automatetheboringstuff.com), I have done some other python learning previously but it's been a while and never got very far. On the site I saw the following flowchart: [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/images/000039.jpg](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/images/000039.jpg)

I wanted to try and code that, but with the addition that if I input anything but 'yes' or 'no' at any point the program will tell me to use only those terms and loop back to the input. It took me quite a while to get the program to work the way I wanted to, but now I wonder if it is unnecessarily complicated? Since I'm absolute beginner I was really just throwing code and changing things until I got it to work, but I don't think I grasp the flow control very well so I probably did unnecessary stuff.

"I'm about to finish ""Python programming for the Absolute Beginner"" by Michael Dawson and in the last chapter it shows how to make a simple game. The majority of concepts clicked really easy, but I'm struggling very hard to wrap my head around the use of sin and cos functions in this case.

I spent the last 2 days learning trigonometry from different sources and I kinda understood how I can calculate unknown positions, angles and how the unit circle works, but that's it. The rest overwhelms my mind because I tend to mix up the concepts of proportion, dimensions, 30-60-90 triangles etc. resulting in a very big frustration....

In the [author's example](https://imgur.com/a/PVE8m5H), he uses the sin and cos functions to determine the velocity of the ship, based on its angle. But I don't get how that works, I assume that the velocity vector on x and y axis is multiplied with the sin and cos of that certain angle. How does multiplying the vector with the result of sin and cos change the direction and speed ? Can someone explain it to me in very simple terms?

At this point i'm a little disappointed, because from what I have seen, game dev is strongly based on trigonometry and vectors, and I'm unable to grasp these concepts, so no game making for me....","learnprogramming,programming"

So I was lucky enough to land my first full-stack web dev job a few months ago as a mostly self-taught dev. At first I was absolutely ecstatic (and I still am in many aspects!), but I've become a bit worried that this role isn't advancing my skills enough to make myself marketable in the future. We currently use vanilla LAMP, jQuery, and an in-house built framework. There is little to no chance that we will be changing our stack or trying something new in the future (I've been advocating for things like Typescript, Vue, Laravel, etc). We don't use Git/Github or any Agile methodology. I've got everyone on board for using Git and Jira, but it's hard to know what to implement without any guidance from a senior dev. We're a super small team, so it's only myself, another junior, and two seniors.

I'm super thankful to have my first job in the industry, but I can foresee myself being ""stuck"" in this type of position if I don't continue to advance myself. I'm looking to ""fill in the gaps"" that I may be missing in my current role, and I'd love some input / guidance on how to do this. Do I build more full-stack projects with frameworks? Do I stick with LAMP? Do I try to learn more specific skills (CI/CD, containerization, idfk, etc.)?

Now I understand c# and one of its frameworks enough to code a lot of simple things without looking anything up. Tic-tac-toe, websites, console apps, most easy - medium LC questions, etc. my biggest issue is just learning how to actually apply the language to real world applications like API’s and databases.

At what point should I start learning a new language? As needed? Or just whenever I have the time?","learnprogramming,programming"

"I only have experience with REST APIs which are request/response communication models and this is my first time dabbling with web sockets and threads. I have come up with a solution but would like some advice on whether I am overthinking this.

*Problem*: I have a website with a button that **ANYONE** can see and click. Once it's clicked, it makes an API call to the backend to trigger some code that may take up to **HOURS** to complete. When the backend code is running, the button will be **DISABLED** and **NO ONE** can click until the backend returns with the result.  Furthermore, when the backend code is running, everyone can see **PERIODICAL UPDATES** on the status e.g. ( Stage 1 , Stage 2, Stage 3, Final stage etc..) reflected at the button.

*My solution*: Use a lock variable to lock the API once it's called, and will only unlock it when the result is returned to the front end. I would also like to use web sockets rather than a REST API call because i would not know when the response will return, and I would also want periodical progress updates.

I have a domain entity Competition, it contains many properties and constructors, as well as the compId, I also have an ArchivedCompetition JPA entity, which I need to contain several properties from the Competition entity, and is instantiated and constructed when a Competition object is archived (by removing from User entity etc), this is really a way to save it permanently and access more easily.

Currenlty I am using that is extends the superclass and uses the @ Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED) to access the Archived objects.

I am now reading that composition > inheritance, and this is poor for performance. Should I just create the ArchivedCompetition as an entirely seperate entity and then just use a constructor to instantiate it with values from the Competition object prior to archiving?

Or should I add the Competition object as a JPA association via OneToOne mapping?

"I'm confused by different implementations of quicksort.  

I feel with something like merge sort, there's really only so many things one can change. Or bubble sort. If you know what they are you know how they behave. 

But, with quicksort. I cant be sure. The fact to me that one can have a  significantly longer runtime for already sorted data then another baffles me. Yes, I know, infintesimals. Sure. But, in the real world its significant. 

Today, my professor described an implementation that I cannot find. Where we start left to right with the right most as our pivot and move our left value in. Then when we swap, we do move our pivot, and then move the pointer from where our pivot was, right to left. 

It makes sense. Its simple. Sure. But any implementation I Google doesn't work like that. 

They pick a pivot at random or in the middle. Ones that pick the right most have a Trifecta swap where we put the swapped number to the right or left of our pivot. 

They take the same concept. But behave differently.

What happens when I want one over the other and all the information I get is ""quicksort"". 

We don't deal with infinite numbers. So categorizing methodologies by the infinite is only helpful if you subdivide by real cases. 

Is the answer just to always bench test things? To not worry and mearly try all the different algorithms just to be sure one is the right choice?

"So I already spend too much time inside. Its currently winter, and I do go out for lots of bike rides in the summer, spring, and fall, but lately I have noticed that I spend a little too much time inside looking at screens. 

I am currently working my way through CS50 and a couple UDemy courses, and when I finish a lecture or a problem set/project, I relax by watching netfilx or playing video games. Of course I have been cutting down on these things, but as I code more during the day, the less daylight is left after I'm done.

My direct report has been in the industry for 15 years.  My position is a Systems Engineer.  I built and maintain our cloud infrastructure, and build various systems that benefit our other engineers.  This job is not entry-level.  I have stock options, 401(k), comfy salary, healthcare.  Yes, I'm a Freshmen in college.  

I've gotten to a point where I have a lot more responsibility in my position as a Systems Engineer and find more joy in my work than I do chasing my degree.

"I know this course gets thrown around a lot. I see a lot of posts or comments with excited people starting their journey with her course. This is not an in depth review of her course.
I just wanted to give a quick warning for people looking to get it. 

The course is extremely outdated. Outdated as in created in 2018, making it 4 years old. Not just that, but because it is outdated some portions of the code will not work causing you to tinker for hours and want to pull your hair out.

I am probably about half way done with the course. I like the way in which she presents the material, straight to the point followed by examples. Still, I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. If you have prior programming experience then yeah, you should be able to figure some of the broken stuff out. 

Can't say I am too excited about learning react from a 4 year old course. 

I know people will tell you that having to figure stuff out on your own is part of being a programmer but this is not the way. Tinkering is acceptable if you are the one making the mistakes but it is not fun when an expert is telling you this is the way and things just don't work.

Edit: I am going to give The Odin Project a go.

For the people asking which sections are outdated:

Html/css- content is good but she is missing modern and more relevant content such as flexbox and grid.

Bootstrap- not everything but some portions won't work with bootstrap 5

jQuery - Other instructors don't teach it anymore because there are better alternatives.

React- I didn't make it that far but people in comments say that it is outdated.

Node- might be outdated. She is using version 12 and we are currently in v 16","learnprogramming,programming"

"I have a HUGE file full of text to process in C language (think 40 GB minimum). The text is divided into lines, but there is no uniformity or pattern that can be followed here (lines have different length, duplicates can happen, etc.) Right now it is being processed in Python but it takes forever and my team would like something more efficient. C was suggested as for various reasons it can already be used in our environment (let's not talk about alternatives now, just focus at C). The idea was to use various low-level functions of C for multithread processing of the file.

The problem is that C seems to have no function to ""jump"" to given line in file and has to read it sequentially (line-by-line) which makes any attempt to speed up the process futile (aforementioned Python script already does this). I just cannot divide the content into chunks to process at the same time in different threads, because it has to be read first.

Is there any way to get to those lines while skipping content before them? Is there some trick with addresses/bytes/bits or some other weird low-level shenanigans that can be used to ""jump"" to a given location in file?

This way, I can update the schedule only once and all employees that share that schedule will have a reference to the most up-to-date version.
This means that I need to have a data structure containing these schedules somewhere, and this data structure needs to have stable addressing. I usually use `std::set` for this due to the stable addressing requirements. Then upon construction of an `Employee`, I pass in a reference to the element of this `std::set` of `Schedule`s that is already constructed.

"Context:

&#x200B;

 I'm currently a Junior full-stack dev at a startup here in brazil and we have basically two main languages, PHP and Typescript. I wanna advance my studies in general software development concepts such as the described on the question but I'm afraid to learn these using PHP and have a hard time transfering those to new languages I learn on the way. 

&#x200B;

I also have to learn about Laravel and Vue for the company and  I thought it would be reasonable to then focus to PHP as my main programming language (I'm also afraid of learning different languages and turning out mediocre in everyone of them). But what if this is a regretable choice? I hear every year that PHP focused jobs are getting less and less paid and less demanded (at least here on my country), I'm thinking of switching my focus to Java so I can stay relevant but then the learning curve would also increase by a lot, and I already have these frameworks to learn. Would that be unwise to do, thinking on time-management?

&#x200B;

If I learn all these concepts using PHP aiming for mid-level positions, would I still be able to consider myself mid-level if I changed my focus to another language? Or am I having a wrong POV from the start and this is not how I should proceed to plan my career? If it helps, I really like back-end and thats what I'd like to focus more.

At first I can absorb most of the learning material, and breeze thru the assignment, but per week they will give us a live coding session, where they would give us cases that we have to solves in 90 to 120 minutes.

On top of this I am going to be working through the JavaScript course on udemy.

Hello everyone. 

I have been trying to get into computer science for a while (I’m 17). From two years ago up to now I tried to learn different things (such as html and css, game dev, and programming bases) but I ended up giving up every single time (for different reasons). I would like to try again and be dedicated, without giving up, in fact I resumed the cs50x that I had given up on last summer. 

My main problem is that while I am trying to learn a thing, I get curious about some other things (concerning cs anyway) that I see, for example, on YouTube, and in those moments I can’t really understand what I want to do, so I just start to think if I am doing the right one or if I would prefer doing another one. This adds up to the fact that I struggle to focus and to be constant in general, so I would like to know if someone has ever felt the same way or at least to receive some tips, because I would really like to find a way to finally get serious in something.

Thanks in advance and sorry for any errors.","learnprogramming,programming"
"TLDR: A close friend is still struggling with basics after 1.5years of starting his learning journey through which he also couldn't keep two separate jobs. At which point should he call it quits ?

I'm currently mentoring a friend who's been trying to break into the field for close to a year and a half. He got a couple a jobs for a month of less each and left because he wasn't good enough.

I've been helping him better his skills before he looks for another job and the problem seems to be that at some point, he forgets the basics and feels lost. 

He understands everything well when I explain to him, but with time he forgets.

So I'm having him go back to the basics again and repeat variations of exercises until he feels comfortable doing it by himself. In the hopes it will stick.

It seems like it's going to take a while, not just because he is a slow learner but also he lacks discipline. 

I told him if in 6 months he's still shaky on the basics then maybe this isn't for him, to which he replied that he doesn't have any alternative ( he got into IT because he couldn't find a decent job in other areas in the first place).

So I'm wondering at which point its fair to say he is just wasting his time and it's not worth continuing ? As opposed to he can get there, it's just a matter of time and perseverance ?","learnprogramming,programming"

I know the question has been asked a million times.

I'm under the impression both are very popular and both are in demand in my area (really anywhere in the US).

From what I gather on here Javascript can be complicated and verbose. However, the Odin project has done well by me, and they teach javascript. So that's an easy transition.

Python appeals to me, and calls to. I've seen a few data scientists do stuff with it and I like it. TOP doesn't teach it though. I don't like what I saw on codecademy, where basically copy pasting stuff all day is supposed to teach you. I like having projects on my github to work one like TOP does.

For python I think there are some course via the helsinki mooc, so that could be an option, but I know nothing about them. It is a Univeristy course though, so there is structure. Not sure if its comparable to TOP or if anywhere else has some good or better still. TOP wasn't perfect after all.

"I am working through Pat Morin's [Open Data Structures in C++](https://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp.pdf) and am having trouble with the following question:

*Exercise 9.7. Why does the method remove(x) in the RedBlackTree implementation perform the assignment u:parent = w:parent? Shouldn’t this already be done by the call to splice(w)?*

I know that no such assignment is necessary with a standard BST, so my intuition is that it has to do with the added sentinel nodes. For reference, see below for the splice (p. 144) and remove (p. 199) methods as implemented in the book.

        } else {
            p = u->parent;
            if (p->left == u) {
                p->left = s;

            return false;

That causes the issue, because when the variable is null I get error: 

`Warning: \`value\` prop on \`input\` should not be null. Consider using an empty string to clear the component or \`undefined\` for uncontrolled components.`

In that sense would I have to use both string and number, so I could initialize the input value as empty string, but on my onChange function make it a number like this?

I tried a CSES question [Apartments](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1084)

. I solved it by the following approach:

1. Sort both the applicants preferred room size list and actual room sizes list.
2. Keep two pointers, one on the applicant preferred room size list and the other on actual room sizes list.
3. Iterate on both lists and keep comparing the room sizes. If the difference is less then the maximum difference allowed, allocate applicant to that room.

I submitted it and all the test cases passed successfully. But my head is constantly revolving around why this approach works. In my head, I know that this works but I am not satisfied by it because I am not able to prove it. Any help will be appreciated.

I want to get back into it and learn about modern web development, potentially with the aim of changing careers over time.

Is that the best route? Also I would like to learn about django as that does seem to be mentioned a lot.

The idea: I would like to create a program/script that is able to perform this task for the technicians in a fraction of the time with less chances of database errors. When I perform this task manually, I have to open the database configuration tool and within that tool are individual built-in programs that are used to execute the database conversion and export that to an Excel sheet to convert values and then re-import it to a new database.

I gotta say, the hardest damn thing is all the terms. The concepts aren't anything that seem too difficult and they're picking them up really fast.

But, the volume of new terms like table, object, field, property, attribute, variable, response body, et al. There's just so much that needs to be learned up front. 

I remember when I started this was the hardest part. You'll read something like ""Add a new key to the array and assign it the value of 'x'"" and (rightfully) ask what a key is and learn that a key can refer to multiple things like a product key or a primary key and put together (somehow) that ""Key"" basically means ""Identifier"" and that you use it to identify which value you want to get and you do all that before even knowing how to access the damn value.

My task/challenge was to rewrite one of these pages so that it uses go and react to query and display the results, because we've seen huge performance benefits to those over the legacy code that's currently use.

Make a go package that uses sql to perform the query and store the results,

 `require File.expand_path('../config/environment', __dir__)`

When I comment this line out of the file, the segmentation fault goes away. It doesn't seem to negatively impact any of the tests I've created either. Any Rails enthusiasts mine explaining what the line is doing or looking for? I do have an environment.rb file in that folder, as well as /config/environments/ folder, but I'm just not understanding the connection between a crazy segmentation fault, and that specific line.

"Hi,

so im currently studying for a bachelor equivelant in sweden, and im at my first year. We've been doing object oriented programming in Java until last week, but now that the course is finished, the continuation course starts in autumn. Now, i dont wanna stop programming since i feel ill get rusty and also, I REALLY ENJOY IT xD . So im looking for small projects or ideas of what to learn next during this breaktime? i will take of course take other courses meanwhile, but no programming. Before doing my 6 months of object oriented programming in Java i did no programming whats so ever. 

Im considering trying out Python or dive deeper into some HTML or JS ( we did some very basic HTML during an intro course). Does this seem like a good idea or does any1 have any other recommendations for me to try ? Looking for either intermediate projects in java or beginner stuff in HTML and JS aswell as other ideas of just useful stuff to know as a programmer.

Thanks in advance!","learnprogramming,programming"
"I've been working with .NET for the last 10 years. Recently I switched to a new company that is using Python. I'm looking for a book or web series that can explain the intent of Pythons designer as well as the inner workings of the language. Something along the lines of C# in depth by Jon Skeet. I'm currently reading Effective Python by Brett Slatkin which is incredibly helpful but it doesn't seem to touch on the languages design decisions. Honestly a lot of what I'm reading seems like the wild west of programming (I guess that's to be expected from a duck typed language). Material that incorporates duck vs static typing would be appreciated as I can use help with the paradigm shift needed between the 2.

I'd also be interested in any material that could be helpful with Django architecture and best practices. I've noticed that my company has many apps in the same project, something that I've never seen in .NET (I've always moved common libraries into a Nuget and then created separate repos and solutions for each service). I understand there may be advantages to doing so in python (debugging across multiple apps from one IDE and other points I've yet to discover), but it feels kind of bizarre to have such huge repos. Is that normal for Python or are there cases where you separate out code and provide packages to specify interactions with a service.

Any help would be appreciated.","learnprogramming,programming"

There’s so many posts about specific areas of programming and specific languages. So many articles about “web development vs software development,” but not “web development AND software development.” I just want to learn it all and I’m not in any hurry to make a career change. 

I’ve always been intrigued by computers and programming but have only recently committed to really start learning. After about two months of being bogged down with details of “where to start if you want to learn X” and “what language is best if you want to do this”, I’ve decided to start with web development and finally typed my very first line of code last week. 

I also want to learn web scraping and automating bots on various platforms. I’m sure I’ll eventually create mods for some of my favorite games and maybe make a game of my one. I’m also eager to look into VR and AR technology. 

I’m not concerned with how long it’s going to take, I just want to get started without excluding anything.

However, when I first started learning the language. I haaaated doing those quizzes or practices like finding prime numbers...etc , and I wanted to do something more practical, like working with datasets, cleaning the data...etc! 

Not because I just want to jump over, but because I get interested in sth when I see its practicality. 

I thought my skills will be tested this way for any job, like have this dataset and work on it. 

After the interview I was given two questions, so simple. I am so embarrassed to talk about them. Well on of them is related to negative indexing(which I thought before why would I use, and never did).

Let's say I cloned a repo that my team is working on. I create a branch called `remove-unneeded-code`, and then remove a block of code that we don't need. I commit, push changes, make a PR, it gets approved, and then merge PR. All is well. But now I wanna change font color or something. So I do `checkout main` to go back to the main branch. When I do that, the block of code I previously removed is reinserted.

"Let’s talk about it, THIS IS NOT FACTS, THIS IS MOST POPULAR OPINIONS OF GAME DEVELOPMENT I HAVE SEEN ON INTERNET AND WHY I THINK GAME DEVELOPMENT IS SEVERELY 


Also it’s coming from 13 year old so it’s not wise to take my words as facts

 Why I think gaming industry is underrated: 


without gaming many streamers would lose their main source of income if they fail to change their style without games.

Without gaming esports would fall apart.

Without gaming less and less people would get into programming

Without gaming people would lose their main source of entertainment

Without gaming many people would lose their jobs and many careers would be useless.


Without gaming Virtual Reality will be slowed down and we probably would not focus on it as much as we do now

Without gaming artificial intelligence also would be slowed down because of how many game devs work on them and making them unqiue and more realistic in their games



Let’s talk about Game programmers, they are seen as shitty part of CS industry, low paid jobs, lack of respect, no stability, overworking.

As a 13 year old, gaming is what got me into this industry, I just feel heartbroken more and more I realize how much it’s mocked and maken fun of.

Mentally, it’s probably hardest job for programming, why? Because when game you worked hard on with company, it’s released and “experts” shitting on you and saying how bad made it is, it affects you mentally especially how overworked you are.


This is all stuff I heard people say as facts and say were major flaws of game industry

"Hello,

\*\*Given:\*\*I have an array with randoms numbers in it and for each number a button (in ReactJS).When a button is clicked, a given map.function prints the corresponding number from the array.

**My task** is now to print always the same message once a button is clicked which is linked to an even number from the array. If the number is not even, it should only print the number.

My approach was to put the following in front of the map.function

    const dummyData = [1,2,4,3,2,5,6];
    const evenNum =  dummyData.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
    let message = ""Hello""

* Checks if there is a text file - if not, creates one with table such as:

**student's name** *student's surname* **student's id** and so on.

* If the file exists, creates a student from the struct, takes data and prints **one student's info** to a line, other student's info will be in the next line
* It can find the student depending on their ID, phone number, mail (but because im doing a char search from lines, you can basically write the name as mail and it'll work out :D)
* When the data given to be searched is found, it prints out that whole line where it was found.
* It can order the students in an alphabetical order by checking their name, or ascending order depending on the ID

* It was a project to improve myself that i decided to code on my own. I wanted to practice file processes mostly. This was the best i could do as a first grader at university. I'm a beginner and i'm coding in C to get a grasp on fundementals properly.

"I'm a high school math and computer science teacher.  It looks like my school is transferring me to a full CS position (super exciting!).  And as part of this they will pay for 4 to 5 CS classes.  

I'd like these to be graduate level classes where I'll really be learning advanced programming.  This would allow me to:

1.) Have the 12-15 graduate CS credits to teach dual credit or college CS classes to my students.

2.)  Give me the know-how to do my own Indie projects, such as making tools/games for learning mathematics.

3.)  Give me the credentials to potentially join an Ed Tech company at some point.

We are moving to an new server because, like most things in life, the cheaper server isnt always better. The only issue is that the new server does not have unlimited storage (and in fact is quite limited in storage) and so we would quickly max out our hosting account by allowing users to have unlimited email. 

The obvious solution would be to automatically delete old emails, however for some reason the host does not have this feature and instead will just discard new emails once a quota is hit. Odd. 

The other solution would be to sign all of the users up for a gsuite account and have google (or comparable) deal with all of the emails. The only issue with that is that most of these companies do not have dedicated IT and google really does not play nicely with outlook and other 3rd party email clients, and it would be quite difficult to convince all of these (mostly older) business owners to move to a new email client for seemingly no reason.

"Does anyone have any thoughts or ideas regarding an email problem I'm having?

I have a custom desktop application that was developed to help my company keep track of and manage processes.  Within the application you can send emails manually.  When you process a stage, (a form within the application dedicated to the work a user needs to complete), an email is sent out saying the stage is complete.  You can also send out emails assigning a stage to a user letting them know they have been assigned.

The problem occurs that some of the more heavy users of the application will have emails disappear when they are sent.  As in they hit send and they don't show up in the office 365 account that is used for sending the emails and the user doesn't receive them.  There is no record of the email at all.  The other odd part is that it seems to be send rate limiting where it won't work for like a 5 minutes span and them work once and them stop working again.  The oddest part though is if I run the application on our server through RDS I don't have this issue at all.  It seems to be user system dependent.

"Hey guys,

For a number of sites, we've been using the [LocomotiveScroll library](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) to have a more smooth scrolling interaction.

But a few times in the past, I've raised the issue that the library breaks the middle mouse ""click"" scrolling. While we acknowledge the issue, we're not really sure of the impact it can have on the end-users (I noticed it because I use the middle mouse ""click"" scroll almost all the time instead of the usual middle mouse scroll).

I'd like to know if anyone has any idea of the fact that the library breaks the middle mouse ""click"" scrolling is affecting accessibility.

Thanks.","webdev,web development,programming"
"Hi!

I am using TailwindCSS which resets all of the styles. It's great since I can just set the styles I want on the elements I want. 

However, I installed a package (Laraberg) which takes Gutenberg editor outside of Wordpress and allows me to create blog posts easily.

It's great, but I have an issue. Since my CSS has been resetted, all of the ""p"" margin are removed, all of  the lists don't look like lists, etc.

Would there be a way to isolate a div from all css classes and then add only the ones I want to change the default style (like text size or color)?

I tried with ""all: initial"" on the top element (.article \*), but I just end up with my classes on the child element not applied.

I just want to remove the reset and add my classes on top of the default browser styles, how can I achieve that?","webdev,web development,programming"

"Our application is run on two separate servers: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

When a user signs up, the frontend calls the backend's signup endpoint. This endpoint creates the user and adds them to a database. It also creates a JWT for the user's subsequent requests to be authorized.

Once this has been completed, the backend now needs to redirect the user to the frontend server's /dashboard endpoint. This can be done with no issue.

The problem is that the frontend also needs to receive the JWT to store locally to be sent to the backend along with subsequent requests made by the user. My initial thought would be to set this as a header in the backend's redirect response. However, I have since discovered that headers set on one server will not be available in the request received by the other server.

What is the best/recommended way to achieve what we are trying to do? In other words, how can a server redirect to an external endpoint and include additional data?

"How to make each <rect> within an SVG clickable

I have an SVG with many <rect> elements that I plan to overlay atop an image with the identical size so that there are clickable regions on the image.

Each of these needs to pop up a div unique to the item on the image that appears to have been clicked.

There are many <rect> elements and I would prefer not to do this by hand, as in, through editing the code manually. I essentially want to make a tool to make this process easier, as I have many images to do this for.

My two thoughts at the moment are:

1. Click the regions of the SVG and input the name of that item into a input box. The tool will parse the SVG and detect which <rect> the mouse x,y is inside, then possibly use regex to append an id to the <rect> equal to the typed name. Would I then be able to make that clickable?

Otherwise,

2. I wonder if I could somehow append <rect> elements with the name inside after the appropriate <rect> region in the SVG, positioning all those in the same place, and using CSS to make one opaque at a time depending on the clicked region.

Again, this depends on being able to click individual <rect> elements in the SVG, as I have not yet been able to achieve that.

Any help or pointers here would be much appreciated.

"This might sound odd but here goes.

It occurs to me that developers and programmers in general have a great deal of power in the modern marketplace because their skills are more in demand than ever.

Yet I scratch my head when I consider that there's millions of talented devs who work for soulless corporations, many of whom are unethical or engaged in highly questionable practices. You don't need me to offer up examples of such companies - they're myriad. The ones who mistreat workers, or contribute majorly to climate change, or avoid tax, or ensure those in their offshore supply chains aren't properly paid. Etc. etc. etc.

And yet there are loads of companies or non-profit organisations out there who need our expertise. Perhaps (but not necessarily) the pay may not be as good, but the fulfillment and contribution to a laudible cause goes some way to making up for this.

So my idea is to launch some sort of initiative to encourage devs to consider whether they're currently applying their expertise in the most ethical setting, and whether they could be more of a 'force for good' by jumping ship. Perhaps it could list ethical job vacancies or something.

But then... who am I to tell some dev his/her job/company is soulless/unethical? Unethical according to whom? So I feel like I'm on to something, but I don't want to seem preachy.

"Freelance full stack web developer here, trying to modernize some of my practices.  A lot of the time when I create a website, I find workflow for images to be the most cumbersome part of the process.  Typically, I first create or edit the image in a program like Photoshop then ""save for web"" and export the file to a ""images"" directory in the project folder.  If I feel it's preferable, I'll sometimes minimize the image file size further on a website like TinyJPG as well.  Most of my projects eventually end up on a shared host, so the images get uploaded to the server with the rest of the website's files/folders.

That's it and it works, but it feels pretty antiquated.  Are there better, faster, and/or more streamlined ways of going about this that I should consider?  What works best for you?

"Client wants me to build a blog with video/audio uploading feature for podcasts. Should I use a CMS for this, or should I build the backend myself with nestjs and build an admin panel using react?

These are some of the pros and cons I thought of:

Pros of CMS:

* No need to spend a lot of code to write the backend, and I don't need to build a custom admin panel
* They handle a lot of stuff for you, like the admin stuff

Cons of CMS:

* I haven't actually learnt a CMS before (except Strapi but honestly I don't like Strapi that much), so there'll be a learning curve
* Not as scalable as features get added
* Slower? (Someone correct me if I'm wrong)
* Can get pricey

Pros of custom backend + custom frontend admin panel

* Scalable as features get added (I don't need to worry if that CMS doesn't support a feature as I can implement it with code)
* Faster

Cons of custom backend + custom frontend admin panel

* Development is initially slower as I need to write all the code (I do have a nice boilerplate but still u get the idea)
* Building the admin frontend panel can be annoying","webdev,web development,programming"
"I think Jekyll is the best of the static site builders because it is easier and more understandable than the others. Some said on Twitter that Jekyll was obsolete. Instead of Jekyll, he said that Next.js, Hugo and etc. exist. However, in my opinion, it is very usable in your small projects and saves time. Ok, I wouldn't say it's good in terms of logic and comfort, but it's fine for blogs and project pages. It also has [many ready-made themes](https://fsuaterdogan.com/blog/best-jekyll-themes) - I like the Serif one). So what do you think of Jekyll?

"🟩 [alwane.io](https://alwane.io) is a web-based tool giving you the ability to extract colors from any website or an existing CSS code, regroup/order colors, then generate a palette including a CSS/Sass file. A simple and handy tool to build your next project's colors, get inspiration, and examine your website's color palette.

https://preview.redd.it/oddaz084kha81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=046c59180075941c7957b920c24723d9eebea573

🟩 It's a straightforward web application to help you generate palettes for your projects. It uses a color sorting algorithm to gather colors from a website's CSS or any other existing CSS code and regroup them into color classes.

&#x200B;

You can then order these colors, generate a CSS or SASS code, and start using it in your project. The tool also offers some other useful features:

1️⃣ Colors can be extracted from an existing CSS code (the one used by the website) or from any other CSS code.

2️⃣ Colors can be sorted and regrouped from a list of Hexadecimal codes.

3️⃣ Colors can be saved in sets: you can therefore create multiple lists of colors so that you can easily manage them. This is incredibly convenient when each set contains colors from a different website or project, and you want to keep track of everything separately.

4️⃣ You have complete control of the pallet, where you can remove one color or a group of colors.

&#x200B;

I hope you like the tool. I'd be happy to answer any questions, and I welcome your feedback.","webdev,web development,programming"
"Hi all,

I  am looking for a nice and simple CMS. I have experience with Wordpress  (obviously, who doesn't), but I feel that this is justway too much for  what I need this time around. The website will be for a small  family-business, so nothing fancy. WP would just add way too much balast  with all the unused features, and the site will be much slower than it  needs to be.

I've seen a couplt of  headless options, but with those the problem is that the business-owner  won't be able to maintain his own website since it will be way too  dificult to manage due to the fact that a headless CMS is designed to do  much more than just a website.

What  I am looking for is a CMS that will enable someone without extensive  IT-skills to just add a page or modify it. Change some text or add a  picture. That's it.

It doesn't  have to come with a template or anything for the front-end of the  website itself, I can make that, and connect to the database to fetch  the needed information. It will need to have a WYSIWYG-interface  (because of the lack of extensive IT-skills) and a way to easily upload  images or PDF's for download on the website. Everything else is optional  as far as I am seeing it now.

I  just don't seem to be able to find something like this. Does anybody  have any idea? It can obviously also be something more extensive, but  then I need to be able to restrict the features for when the owner logs  in.","webdev,web development,programming"

"Hi all !

I've had a problem for a long time now, and I'd like to know if anyone else has experienced it.

I have a video, embedded from Youtube, on the homepage of my site. When I play it though, the video is pushed to the left. That creates a black border on the left, about 40px wide, and since the containing div is set to overflow:hidden;, the play/pause button is hidden.

The video looks fine on my laptop and phone ; it only does it on my iPad with iOS 15.2. But it does it both on Safari and Chrome. And I'm certain it's not caused by the CSS ; if I add a border to the iframe or to the containing div, it shows that both are located where they should be. It looks like it's really the content inside the iframe that's out of place.

Has anyone else had this issue ? Maybe I'm not googling the right terms but I can't find a reference to this anywhere.

to express an endpoint that exports a list of user messages However, I don't believe this is a correct URL. I would think most do

    /{parent=users/*}/messages/export

to express that. The colon-path is in Google's AIPs [https://google.aip.dev/136](https://google.aip.dev/136). I'm just curious if anyone uses or prefers Google's standard as this is the first time I've come across it.

&#x200B;

**Edit**

Further reading showed Geewax's justification for the design choice

>While the resource path is identical to standard methods, there is one difference with the action at the very end of the path. To avoid any confusion about where the resource (or collection) stops and the custom action begins, it’s critical that we don’t reuse the forward slash character as a separator between these two key components (e.g., POST /rockets/1234567/launch). Instead, we can use the colon character (“:”) to indicate that the resource has ended and a custom action has begun. This might look a bit strange, but it’s important to avoid any ambiguity, especially because the path is technically valid if we were to use a forward slash.

"I want to build a blog site, but I don't know where I should build it

I am very good at HTML, CSS and I'm starting to learn Javascript. The idea has always been that I should build my blog site from scratch on Visual studio code, buy the domain and then launch it. However, I've realised that to edit the blog posts pinned on the home page I would have to constantly go into the actual code and change things from there, and that sounds inefficient and tiresome.

I did a quick google search and apparently using WordPress or Squarespace is more efficient. But I want total control of the layout of my site, I want to be able to design every aspect from scratch so that I get the perfect outcome I'm looking for

So my questions are: Will I still retain full control if I use WordPress or Squarespace? or should I just continue coding my site (which would mean I may have to get back into the code to change things displayed every two weeks)?

Can I get the best of both worlds, Is there a way to write the code and then somehow merge it into Squarespace or WordPress?

How do large companies like Stripe or Google update information on many of their pages, specifically on their landing pages not docs?

I'm specifically mentioning landing pages because they are unique pages and you can't just switch out info and turn it into a second page (like some sort of template)

Fast refresh does not work with many third party libraries. You cannot disable it. Browsing the GitHub issues shows people who have wasted entire weeks with vague bugs introduced by this feature not playing well with libs. The NextJS contributors don't care.

The app lifecycle does not have a feature to run code once on startup. There are many reasons to do this. My example is to check that the database I'm connecting to has the correct structure and validation rules in place. The solutions offered are to use a custom server which negates a lot of the reason to use NextJS in the first place.

Would this be possible with sheet API? I know I can query it for data from my spreadsheet  but would it be possible to do this whole asynchronies event?

Asynchronous:

query using id API => get score value of specific user => set that score value on logic sheet input =>

=>get output => display it on HTML

"I'm looking for solutions for hosting client sites with multiple non-technical editors.

I don't want to have self-host a headless CMS somewhere (e.g. WordPress if used this way), get locked into a proprietary managed CMS platform (like Contentful) or have to wait for full site rebuilds to get previews of changes.

Does this exist?

- Open source.

- All data is stored in Git/GitHub.

- The CMS can be accessed online (it's just an HTML page with some JavaScript), runs in your browser and edits + previews the site by pulling/pushing from Git, like Netlify CMS. 

- When you're editing in the CMS, you get a fast, live and accurate preview of what the page will look like e.g. you don't have to save and wait for the site to rebuild.

- Has a basic page builder e.g. you have a header component that you can change the heading and hero image by editing some fields, a feature list component that lets you edit an image, name and description for each feature, and you can add combinations of these components to any pages you want in any order you want.

- On saving changes, the site is rebuilt via something like GitHub actions or Netlify, and the website is just HTML and CSS (no JavaScript) you can host on something like Netlify.

I like Netlify CMS but to get close to live previews it looks like you need to roll your own React components (or glue code) to generate  previews (plus Netlify CMS don't seem to have done any major releases for a while). Is there a static site generator that is already connected up to a CMS like this? I really like Hugo for example (it's so much faster than other static site generators), but there's no reasonable way get live previews in Netlify CMS because it's written in Go.","webdev,web development,programming"

&#x200B;

Reasons why I want to move to U.S:

1. Pay is much more than in Canada
2. No language barrier and I can easily integrate to it's society since I was raised in Canada

Reasons why I do not want to move to US:

1. I do not like how they treat their own citizens, worker rights are constantly being exploited
2. I don't like the politial aspects/culture  &  systematic racism  in the states (ranging from how both parties  that does not advocate for the working class; ACAB;  facist groups existing and rising in popularity). I feel unsafe as someone who is not caucasian.

&#x200B;

Reasons why I want to to EU (social democratic EU countries to be particular):

1. Worker rights are known to be better, especially in scandaniavna countries. From a quick glance I  feel much safer due to existing saety nets, retiring there, etc.

Reasons why I do not want to move to EU:

1. I can see myself having a hard time integrating into their society since I do not speak their languange; making friends will be challenging.
2. Pay is much lower, can be a problem retiring?
3. I am unware of their politics and specific problems.

"**Context:** I will explain this briefly. I have a decent amount of programming experience (Python, Java), and I am building a website as a personal project to learn about web scraping. 

I am currently in the process of building a scraping tool of certain stocks from newspapers. I want to display these as a list on my website. Essentially, a list which looks something like this:

|Stock Name:|number of mentions (select timeframe - week/month/year)|Performance (select timeframe - week/month/year)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|random company inc.|69|\+5%|

I want to be able to sort this list of stocks by the different values (name, number of mentions etc.), by clicking the column header.

Is there some simple framework which does what I listed above automatically? Or will I have to do this manually (perhaps by using sql or http requests?)? I have seached for different ways to solve this exact problem, but none of my searches have been successful since **I don't know what to search for**. All I need is someone to point me in the right direction, and I'll figure out the rest.

I'm looking at a few different sites that are *mostly* text with some images. Think internet forums or a wiki.

"   Hi. Quick intro about me. I'm 26 yo junior web dev at a company. It's been 4 months already since I landed my very first programming job. I've learned working with codeigniter, practiced PHP, built few apps like Quiz application or Task calendar for employees. However still have to practice more of front-end. 

&#x200B;

   The problem currently I'm facing is that my boss is not satisfied with my working tempo. He said that he understands that I'm junior however given tasks should be accomplished much sooner. Also he said that main problem is in that that I'm not able to tell when the given task will be accomplished. I'm having really hard time with telling estimated deadline because on way in building I'm getting frequently stuck with working with CSS which really delays production time. I'm doubting if programming is really my thing because that's what kind of vibes  my boss is giving me. Or maybe on the other hand my company just does not know how to ""treat"" programmers.  They just give me task with singe title with no description and accusing me for not asking them for details that I have been missing on the way while building the app. Feeling rushed in programming is really frustrating, so I want to to find solution on what to focus. I love learning new things, on daily basis, however they are pushing me into fast production. Anyways they are expecting me to be senior fast coder and it's only been 4 months since I started my first dev job. Should I quit and find something in other field or stick with sweet web development? I really love coding but maybe I'm not fast enough for companies, Not meeting their requirement you know!

Idea 2 - Paid Plugins : Scratched

Idea 3 - SaaS : I have a solid idea for a SaaS company I believe, but will not start on this till my job board is out and functional, even though I'm real excited about it.

* Has a news/blog feed. Posts should be easy to create/edit by the client.
* Has an authentication option where logged in users can access additional pages.
* Has a meeting notes section where users can download the notes of their weekly meetings. These meeting notes are in PDF format and so the client needs to able to easily upload these files and provide a link to them. The layout in the website could be something as simple as:

I applied to them and found out that they don't have a single developer, and I would be the first one (and only for a while) to bring some of the software maintenance in-house from the agency.

I would handle the trade site while the agency maintains the retail one. This requires a lot of skills for a new developer, including full-stack and DevOps strategies, with like a thousand integrations.

When I try to visit the website with my primary account [https://learn.unity.com/mission/learning-unity](https://learn.unity.com/mission/learning-unity) I get a brief UI then disappears rapidly, I tried to log out and visit that one again and the website loaded smoothly, also I tried to log in with my secondary account and the result was without problem again, even when I try to get to the site with my primary account then occurs that problem.

I think a problem is connected with my primary account.

There are samples of problems:

"Hi all, a while back I tried TOP and eventually gave up on it. Using a VM for more than an hour would cause my computer to overheat and lag terribly. I have an older model Microsoft Surface Pro which has a crappy ventilation system, so it can only do so much at one time before I have to turn it off so it can cool down. I'm trying to get back into learning about frontend web development, but am looking for great alternatives to TOP to develop my skills. Any suggestions?","webdev,web development,programming"
"In the beginning, I was able to google and research topics because it was general knowledge training but currently a lot of what I need to understand lacks documentation and is internal to the company codebase and libraries (which mostly lack documentation online). 

I'm trying hard to figure it out on my own and trying to ask questions maybe once or twice a day at most but I'm spending hours to a full day trying to solve some lack of understanding that if I asked questions about it I could probably solve in 5-10 minutes. 

Any suggestions on how to approach this? I'd rather look dumb now while I'm still learning then later on when I'm expected to understand what I'm doing. 

At the same time, I have a co-worker who barely asks questions and is already maybe two days ahead of me in terms of getting stuff done (it's only been a week or two since we started)and I'm starting to feel like ""damn am I just incompetent?"".

The thing is I'm trying my best and even trying to find some sort of documentation of reviewing general concepts after work but because I need to ask questions which I'm not asking out of fear of looking dumb, or bothering my supervisors, I'm lagging behind.","webdev,web development,programming"

"I'm a long time native mobile dev who's finally getting around to learning the basics of web development to set up a website idea I've had. 

I figured I'd start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since those are the default languages of the web.

Recently though, a friend told me about Typescript, which I guess is JavaScript with additional features that gets compiled back to JavaScript?

Before I commit to a few hours of diving into the language, I just wanted to double check the whole TypeScript thing. 

Is TypeScript a popular alternative to Javascript? Are lots of companies using it, or is it sort of niche, like CoffeeScript and HAML used to be

Is it becoming the new standard for webdev?

Ideally I store that information in a database somewhere on a server, and pull from it as needed (although if this isnt always necessary I'm open to suggestions)

"Hi Guys,

I'm working on transitioning my MERN stack workflow to a serverless workflow hosting all throughout MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Realm

Mongo's new(ish?) Realm feature allows you to have serverless API endpoints which helps reduce the need for the E&N from ""MERN"" but the one part that I'm stuck on is authentication.

Realm has Authentication and App user features, however, I have no idea how I can implement this. I use Google Firebase Auth, but I really want to transition to having everything under one hood (I'm so close to turning what used to be a Heroku + Mongo + Firebase + etc. workflow into just a MongoDB workflow). 

Mongo typically has amazing documentation on their features, but Realm based documentation is extremely spotty and sometimes straight up inaccurate due to how new / often changing it is.

Everything I've found out how to accomplish via Realm has been through 2 specific YouTube videos one by FreeCodeCamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4) (Starts at the 2 hour mark) and one by Michael Lynn (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM3fcw4M-yk)

Lately I've been meaning to start a social media clone but I've stumbled upon a question that I've yet to answer. How are news feeds implemented? Leaving aside ai and ml algorithms, what tools are used. I understand that activity stored in sql db is a no-go since it won't scale. A possible implementation using message queues could(?) work but I'm not convinced that it could actually scale much. So does anyone know how one can implement it in a highly scalable way?

"**TLDR: Imagine that you were tasked with proposing a new, intuitive, term to replace the term** ***HTTP cookie.*** **What term(s) would you propose (& why)?**

Given that the term *HTTP cookie*, [which, according to Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Origin_of_the_name), got its name from the term *magic cookie*, is unintuitive (IMHO at least) - especially when compared with intuitive terms such as *local storage* and *session storage*, which serve similar technical purposes - what would you suggest as a more intuitive term to replace *HTTP cookie*? Why that/those term(s)? Please offer multiple terms if you have lots of ideas!

(The main constraint/goal for the term is to balance describing its technical purpose and its memorableness/catchiness. On the aforementioned spectrum, *HTTP cookie* is arguably too far down the catchy end of the spectrum, so looking for something that tells its technical purpose more. Arguments for cookies intuitiveness are welcome as well.)

**My (Biased) Favorites**: *the reason why*

* **HTTP Passport**: *because it captures both the authentication (identification) and tracking purposes of modern cookies while being easy to remember.*

"So I'm working on this idea of creating an interactive visualization of a supply chain. The below is a sample supply chain consisting of various actors like distributors, subcontractors etc. The real use case is much more complex though.

The idea is to create an interactive supply chain flow so that a viewer can interact with it to understand the flow of the supply chain/ the various paths that exist/their outcomes etc.

Furthermore, (in a sort of gamified approach) Users can drop in some pre-made obstructions/issues at different stages of the supply chain, for example at the manufacturer side they can drop an issue like ""Factory equipment Failure"" and can then subsequently proceed to see how that affects the supply chain and the steps that are taken to resolve this issue, the various players involved etc.

I've seen

* strapi
* keystone
* Sanity,
* Contentful,
* Prismic,
* Cosmic

I need something simple

* I have a react website. I don't need a website. Just the CMS backend.
* I just need a very simple way to write and publish blog posts
* I need to be able to grab blog posts via rest or graphql so I can display them in my react website
* I would prefer hosted (was looking at self-hosting strapi, but you really need a paid heroku, need to setup postgres, need to setup s3, I'd rather just pay for a hosted solution at that point and save myself the time/headache)

&#x200B;

Strapi looked promising other than having to cobble together the self hosting AND I couldn't see a simple ""blog template"" for the backend. The blog tutorials are all out of date.

Sanity I didn't really get. Seems like it includes the frontend website not just the frontend CMS.

keystone seemed like more work then it's worth

contentful too pricey.

Is there anything out there where I can just log in to a hosted admin panel, write blog posts, and then grab the content via api?

EDIT: buttercms seems to be exactly what I need, but I don't really want to shell out $99/month in this case... any alternatives out there?

"Hey guys! I'm building this Isometric User Interface with the CSS transform property. By rotating the X-axis of an CSS grid with 60 degrees and rotating the Z-index with 45 degrees I create this illusion of a 3D landscape. 

Then, with a 2D array:

"Hey,

I haven't really encountered a situation like this before, so I was looking for some other opinions on how to handle this. Essentially I am building out a TCG deck builder and I've ran into a few possible scenarios but can't decide what's best

&#x200B;

So some possibilities I was thinking:

\- **users/123** to return profile

\- **users/123/decks** to display the users decks

\- **users/123/decks/456** to display a specific deck of the users

&#x200B;

Similarly for the actual cards I was thinking something like:

\- **expansions/** to list all expansions

\- **expansions/123/cards** to list all cards in an expansions

\- **expansions/123/cards/456** to display a certain card

&#x200B;

All of those seem pretty standard REST API paths but I was wondering if they're too verbose or if I should have those but since I also want some search functionality should I also have more direct routes to display similar data... such as:

\- **cards?search=example-card** to search for cards

\- **cards/123** to look at a specific card or should the link just go to **expansions/456/card/123**?

\- **decks?search=example-deck** same as card above

\- **decks/123** to look at a specific deck

&#x200B;

Been trying to search a bit if having different routes displaying similar data is conventional or not but I'm not quite able to find the discussion I'm looking for so I figured I'd ask here if anyone has solved something similar and has some advice

"I am a professional in the IT industry currently performing at the senior/architect level.

Both in my academic track as well as when I started working as a junior dev, the advise was always to “don’t repeat yourself” when writing code. If you have to write something twice it is instantly code smell and you need to make an abstraction. Make a module where you can. Abstract to a point where everything is a library and can be reused.

Now many years into the business I can tell you with confidence that this teaching is BS and does not apply to the real world.

More often than not, copying something is a perfectly valid solution to a problem if it saves you a lot of time. No, you don’t have to make a component or library or otherwise shared piece of code if it means you having to spend a significant chunk of time and resources doing it. 

The reason? In real life things don’t get reused as often as you think. Because before the next iteration comes along a PM or business person will come along and decide you have to rewrite that part of the abstraction completely. Or that they want to kickstart a new project and the libraries you spent so much time on don’t align at all anymore with the new way of working, possibly a new framework or technology all together.

Ofcourse, there are many situations where you absolutely DRY. If reusability is a core requirement of your project for example. but honestly this happens far less than you think. Quantity over quality is the defacto for many big companies, like it or not.

Take my adviseIf repeating yourself makes your life a lot easier, please do. Your boss won’t care.","webdev,web development,programming"

The actual final app would include a lot of text/images and some video content.

"[https://crates.io/crates/broken-links](https://crates.io/crates/broken-links)

This is a CLI I wrote in Rust and just released last week. From the readme:

> `broken-links` is a tool to help you identify broken links on  a website. Provide a  URL to start the check, and it will find and check  all href links  (excluding anchors) on that page. For any links within  the same domain,  it will then visit them and collect and check  subsequent links, and  then do the same with those links, and so on until  it has exhausted all  the links it finds within the provided domain. It  attempts to avoid  checking the same link twice, though this may  sometimes happen. Note  that it will check external links, but will not  then visit them to find  additional links to check. In any case, you  probably don't want to run  this on google.com or some website that you  don't control.

I  haven't yet gotten around to creating binaries for different distros or adding it to package managers, but intend to do that in the future. In  the meantime,  you can install it pretty easily if you already have Rust  on your system.

I have to migrate a Wordpress website without access to the backend, and there are a lot of articles with images strewn about them. The workflow of copying and pasting into CKEditor in Strapi is nice, but it just renders the image from the url, which a WP install that will be taken offline. The only trick I've found that actually puts the images into the clipboard which then gets uploaded into Strapi is copying it into Word first and then copying it from there into Strapi.

"A developer on my team recently threw out the axiom ""every image should have an alt tag"" and it prompted a discussion of the topic. I thought I'd get some opinions from here on the topic...

First, I'm pretty certain the axiom is false on the surface for accessibility concerns. Plenty of images shouldn't have alt text because said alt text would only add confusion (e.g. background images or spacers and such) in accessibility situations. Further I submit that the alt text I see being used most of the time really isn't adding any accessibility value. Plus, let's be honest, how many people are REALLY testing the accessibility of their sites. I've been doing this for 30 years at many companies working on many sites and never once had someone actually test the site using a text browser and make changes accordingly. I'm not saying we shouldn't have, just saying I've never seen or heard of people doing such testing unless they specifically knew they had an audience that needed it.

Second, the other major rationale I've seen regarding alt tag usage is for SEO. I think this is only valid for a portion of sites. If your site is an intranet or an app mainly hidden behind a login page, SEO really doesn't come into play, right? Search engines aren't indexing the interior pages of my web app and I'm not expecting someone to find an interior page of my web app through a search engine. Thus alt tags provide no SEO value on those sites.

Don't get me wrong, I think alt tags, used correctly, can be helpful. They just need to be used thoughtfully and in the correct context.

TL;DR - I think alt tags on images are a rule we've been blindly applying the wrong way for quite a while. Their presence or absence is not the critical issue many seem to think it is for the majority of sites.","webdev,web development,programming"

I want to hopefully have it include syntax highlighting and the whole nine yards, and I'm excited to get a start on it, however I have a slight problem someone here may be able to help me with.

What I was planning on doing was having an editable `<pre>` element or something of the sorts and on the input event, format the SCSS with indentation and whatnot, and include syntax highlighting. To do this I had planned on hopefully using some packages (one to tidy the SCSS and another to convert it to HTML with highlighting, or just one that can do both).

The problem I have is after searching for quite a while, I couldn't find anything. I found something for SASS but I don't want to use that. We use SCSS for our styles and switching to SASS for this seems stupid.

So, what I'm asking here is, is anyone familiar with any node packages capable of doing what I need? To be clear, I do not need to convert it to CSS, that I have handled. I just need to tidy and (optionally but hopefully) include syntax highlighting.

"As explained above. Someone married to a famous NFL player runs this domain/hosting business called Bludomain, and has a littering of reviews online doing this to people.

The lady had us pay $100 to transfer and ghosted us. I found her cell phone and she wants $20 to renew the domain. It has expired, and I guess the one truth is it truly is expired and not renewed and being held by her.

We've both seen the problem first hand. Him as a developer fixing the broken forms, and myself as a business/sales guy missing out on leads.

For example, my partner once had a form break for a roofer, where each project is $10k - $25k. He missed out on numerous leads. When they found the black hole they were going into, a customer with a $30k project said ""I actually wanted to hire you guys but I never heard back"".

"I originally posted this in web_design, but would love to get the webdev community's perspective.

I've always preferred design over development and so I was thrilled to recently partner with a developer who wanted to outsource her design work to me. How it works -- she finds clients and acts as the sole point of contact, I create the designs in Adobe XD, and she then recreates them in WordPress. We've both been very happy with this relationship.

However she recently told me that she would like to sell website templates through her agency and asked what I would charge to create the designs. These would be 5 page websites, created exclusively in Adobe XD. She does not need me to link anything or make it interactive, and does not need mobile or tablet versions done. Using my designs, she would then recreate these templates in Wordpress and sell them as her own on an ongoing basis.

I initially said I'd be interested in earning a commission with each sale, but she came back to ask how much I would charge for a fixed fee. Her client base isn't huge so I honestly don't see this as a massive downside, though I do feel that I can charge a bit more since I won't be earning a commission on sales.

// Provider is a Context Provider that is exported  
export const Provider = () => {  
 values = {}  
 return <Context.Provider *values*={values}></Context.Provider>

"This question is about the developer side of things, I understand that there is pressure from POs and users to go with a modern look. 

Take old reddit and new reddit as an example. Old reddit loads seems to be more based on text, everything looks and feel complete a few miliseconds after loading.

New reddit seem to load in parts - if you have a slow internet/computer you get the first html structure that will load blankly, then other parts of the design will load after. It may take only a few ms more of loading, but in user experience it feels way more slow than the old website. 

Now this is the feeling I get with most modern websites : all major social media, newspapers, blogs, even [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) that still loads fast but still has the modern bloat.

So from a developer point of view, what has changed? I'm still new into web developing, but the first thing I notice is that these websites seem to load much less content on the root HTML, and it's being inserted by JS/frameworks. Is that a major factor on page responsiveness? Higher quality images and videos may play a role, but that doesn't seem to go away with gigabit internet - modern browsers will load fast but require a fair amount of CPU processing and RAM.

"Hi folks, 

I've made an ecommerce Django API + React dashboard some times ago for a prototype where Stripe was just handling final payments, but I wouldn't be confident pushing it to production right now so I'm evaluating solutions at hand. 

I have a platform where I would want to allow my subscribed users to sell stuff as a side activity ( which means I wouldn't need full fledged functionalities an Ecommerce site would offer ) on a sort of marketplace, Stripe Connect seems to be the right solution for that, permitting to handle payments and distribute funds after a fee is applied. 

But what about the product creation part ? Stripe's API seems capable of doing that. In that scenario what additional value would something like Shopify's API give me ? 

Or does Shopify API also has a way to handle multi tenant marketplaces ? Or is it even possible to use Shopify's API for product management, carts etc and then use Stripe Connect for payments (with certainly a worse integration with Stripe dashboards I guess) ? 

I would honestly prefer avoid being dependent on 2 platforms so if Stripe is enough It would be better since I'm already vendor locked with them for other kinds of payments anyway. What about an open source solutions like Saleor + Stripe ?

"I've just published a scrabble word finder. This app takes in a list of letters and 0-2 blank tiles, and will output a list of all words which can be formed with those letters and their scores. If blank tiles are specified, it will search for all possibilities to fit those tiles, report which substitutions were made, and the score will be calculated accordingly.

Behind the scenes, this is using a trie data structure to store the dictionary. I've implemented the trie myself with the normal methods + a few search methods to facilitate the work that needs to be done on this app. When given the list of letters, plus wildcard for the blank tile, it will start at the root node of the trie and, for each letter, get that child node (if it exists), and for the wildcard, iterate over all child nodes, and recursively call the search method with the new node and choice removed.

On the frontend, I'm using Angular to power the entire website; this is a page on that website and thus uses Angular components and services to get the job done.

"Hi everyone, I've been working as front-end full-stack for past 4 years now. Till now, I have known the way to write models file which would establish the schema models and create/update them in MySQL/PostgreSQL or even MongoDB.

At my current workplace, in past eight to nine months, this is my first time diving into my team specific backend service. 
- The code base is in Sails.js (ultimately a express.js wrapper, though do let me know any major differentiating points.)
- The team has built the Query builders based on DSLs. 
- there are two DBs MySQL and ES (elasticsearch).
- we have only two major endpoints exposed
-- `/reports/group?group=groupId&section=sectionId` (if there is section also)
-- `/reports/stored?report=reportId` for fetching more details after clicking on any of this report. 
- we render page with different graphs, to fetch the details of that page hit the first endpoint which brings let's say 5 reports
- On clicking of a single-data-point in this rendered chart, the 2nd mentioned endpoint would be hit to fetch more granular level of details, which is being shown in Tables on FE. 

I mentioned this here to clear the confusion, and since I've implemented the same on FE in past couple of months. (so yayy!)

Now this DSL based design of building query pipelines is a new design for me to grasp(grokk). 

- Can you guys mention ways that I can debug through the BE services side code, standard ways to explore and understand the entire flow?
- What are other code-designs out there that big company teams use to build such backend service?

Hope everyone's having a good Sunday. I've been working as a junior web developer for about 10 months now and I was recently asked about building a new website for a local sports club that I'm an active member of. 

I said I would look into it and I've done some research on the technical side of things and come up with a solution which I think would work for them, which in short is a Next.js app hooked up to NetlifyCMS so that they can edit their content as and when they deem necessary. Any serious technical changes they require I can then do as and when they request, and in the event I'm no longer contactable the code is stored in a public repo for them to hand over to another developer.

"something ive been thinking about recently. when watching tutorials about javascript or a react tutorial, they usually show how to get data with fetch(). since its asynchronous the typical flow is something like:

* set loading to true
* spinner is shown while loading is true
* get data and save in a variable
* set loading to false
* data is shown now that its fetched and loading is false

it makes logical sense, but you always have to handle the loading state and the facts that the data is not available right away.

now i havent worked with php for quite a while, but when i did it was a very different experience. i would get data from phpmyadmin with SQL queries. but i would never have to think about loading states. the content would appear instantly as if it was hardcoded in the html. it was basically:

* get data
* data is shown

if you dont show spinners/conditionally render in JS, you get errors because you are trying to display undefined variables. but i never had to take this into account when working with php.

most websites just show the content right away, and im sure the content is coming from a backend. is this just because most websites are php(wordpress)?

so i was just curious if there was a specific reason for this? its obviously a better user experience to show content right away instead of constantly having spinners show.","webdev,web development,programming"

We are currently considering whether we **should in the future support multi-tenancy / marketplace solutions**. Basically, allowing you to run multiple store setups under one backend with different control permissions. This has not been a focus up until now, although there seems to be some interest from a few of you Redditors here and inside our own community.

**We, therefore, wanted to hear whether this is actually a solution that is sought after?**   
\---

Our current setup offers:

* E2E order, customer and product handling for B2C customers
* A composable architecture enabling you to switch all parts of your stack
* Out-of-the-box integrations for e.g. CMS, fulfillment, payments, analytics, marketing, search etc.
* Multi-regional support to allow you to use local currency + shipping and payment providers
* Automated return/claims/exchange flows
* User-friendly admin panel

\---

Would also be good to know if there would be other kinds of features you would be needing if you were to consider an open-source solution to support multi-tenancy or marketplaces?

Let me hear your thoughts!","webdev,web development,programming"

"Hi everyone, 
I need to buy a new laptop and I was looking at:
1. M1 Pro 14 inch 8 core cpu 14 core gpu (base) with 32 gb ram 1tb ssd
2. M1 pro 16 inch 16gb ram 1tb ssd 
I am student rn but I worked as a junior full stack developer intern where I was using around 17 gb ram when working on a React project with chrome vscode slack and every thing else open. I also plan on using docker in the near future for a personal project.

"I'm in the process of writing a proposal for what would be my first freelance gig. The company wants me to build a new website which they will link to from their current site. They told me they'd prefer me to set up the hosting myself.

My question is, for this sort of thing, would I need to register a separate domain name for my new website? They already have a site (let's call it companyname.com). Is there any way I could use their existing domain name for my site, even if my site is hosted separately from their current site? Ideally I'd like companyname.com/mysite, or maybe mysite.companyname.com to direct to my website. But is this even possible if my site is not hosted on the same server as their current site?

"Hello everyone, I am currently facing some hard time in handling a very chatty team. Namely what often happens during PRs, which we do in our Github ( which again had awesome PR collaboration options), is that other devs call me to do their review instead of writing the comments, or they call me after the review to again explain to me each and every comment they made as if they either could not properly write or I could not properly read.

I am hating that !

This leads to lots of discussions going undocumented in our PRs, and makes it really hard later on to put the missing flow of thoughts together in case that something is wrong. Further often same discussions are done multiple times, since the things discussed in private are not written in the pull request leading to multiple loss of time.


Lastly I feel very strongly about quality, and I feel that I can not sufficiently focus on providing a quality review if I am forced to spell it out live. Usually I have an idea but need to first check if it is feasible in order to avoid talking nonsense, which is just not possible if done on the spot.

At first glance it seems quite thorough to me, but it's hard to really judge it without diving deeper. Just to make their suggested path a bit more clear, I've put the lessons in a table:

|Num|Course|
|:-|:-|
|1.1|[Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)|
|2.1|[CSS first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)|

|7|[Server-side website programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side)|

It seems like they suggest to first learn the basics of each of the different aspects of web development. After that, there doesn't seem to be any laid out path; however, there's a lot more lessons on each of these subjects to learn more.

I was wondering if any of you have experience with this guide or, if not, if you think this looks like a good path to follow for somebody who's looking for a structured way to learn in order to make a career switch.

"I am working on a side-project to learn web-development. The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of ""content""(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging.

[bondage.js](https://github.com/hylyh/bondage.js) is a project that has become abandoned, which brought some support for parsing the language in Javascript.

"We have the following scenario:

Website A has GTAG installed and tracks every page visit, sending a internalUserId along in the dataLayer (when the user is logged).

Website B is a CRM where we list all users, and it uses the same database as Website A.

In the CRM we need to see what pages each of our users have visited.

Proposed solution:

Ideal solution: call Analytics API passing internalUserId and returning a list of pages the user visited.

Alternative 1: make Website A call an internal API that registers a visit, along with any other metadata. Unfortunately the dev team behind Website A wants to avoid this approach as it will send yet another request on every page, thus slowing the page down. So the suggestion was to leverage analytics to gather this information.

Alternative 2: somehow instruct Tag manager to call an external API every time a visit occurs, and send along any meta data. I don't actually know if Tag manager offers this service or not.

The alternative 1 & 2 will mean that we will store the visit stats, while the ideal solution will use Analytics stats.

So the question is:

Does Analytics API offer the ability to query for a specific user identified by a custom property, internalUserId, that we set using dataLayer, and return that user's stats (visits) ?

I am a freelancer in web dev. Basically, in 6 months, I am going to go full time back-end dev freelance. I think I am quite a fast worker, but I get exhausted after a few hours of code. I think it's neither good or productive to work longer (as I don't work by the hour).

However,  I have a hard time figuring out what to learn. Like, there are some really cool things that might be fun (three.js, for example), but nothing really ""worth it"" for my business. I could learn a new language/framework, but I don't see the point if Laravel really fits my needs.

"I've been working as a web developer for over 8 years now, I now find myself a full-stack developer working on a mobile web app, I'm part of a 3 man team and I'm struggling.

I have issue's with complexity and understanding the codebase, it feels like all my energy is drained when I have to try and come up with complex solutions to business problems, I have trouble understanding code written by my colleagues, code that has effects in multiple places, and I feel like I'm slowly burning out.

I started (self-taught) web development making frontend websites, I learned how to make a CMS to support that frontend, and I loved crafting small landing pages, or interesting little apps that run on node, but every project I did was small, and was usually completed after one month, I feel like I never learned to grasp complex code, or how to come up with solutions to things my colleagues are doing naturally (so it seems).

"I'm just curious how you folks who are using Tailwind (with React, if that matters) are theming your own components.  For example, let's say I'm working on my own custom button.  I could obviously add, let's say, `bg-red-500` to the button to make it a red background.

I do this for a bunch of other components so they all have a theme using a specific color palette.  But then let's say I decide later I hate the red and I want to go with blue instead.

At this point I've incorporated the red with the button, and rings around form inputs, and other things.

I like the default Tailwind color palette.  I'm not really trying to override that (which is what the Tailwind Theme document goes into).

What are the best practices for theming different components?  I thought about creating my own theme format by extending the default theme and adding something like:

    colors: {
      button: {
        background: ...,
        ...
      },
      input: {
        ring: ...,
        ...
      }
    }

Then in the button component I would use the color `bg-button-background`.  At some point I could then just change the color by modifying the theme override.

I'm just not sure if that's the best solution or if there are any better solutions.

Idea 1 - Job Board : On my last dev log I said that I would have pictures of my UI this time, that turned out to be a little optimistic lol. I am still working on the UI and will get pictures as soon as i can. I spent too long yeaterday going through the various options for rich text editors. I was suggested to use tiny, but without paying it is too limited. I looked into Tiptap and slate but neither seemed appropiate. I ended up using draft from facebook, but the example docs are not even updated for hooks in React. So I may spend next coding session creating my own. I only want simple things like bold, italics, bullet points, numbered bullets, and font sizes. So I am confident I can build that out.

Idea 2 - Paid Plugins : Scratched

Idea 3 - SaaS : I have a solid idea for a SaaS I believe, but will not start on this till my job board is out and functional.

Personal notes : My parents are visiting this weekend which I am hyped about. That means that I prpbably won't get a good coding session in till Monday, which also means my next dev log might not be till Tuesday. Still hyped about the job board and can't wait to show yall what I have done so far (again im at a junior level, and not a great designer, still proud of my work though so far anyways).

"Just started learning web design (CS major but never touched web dev) and I'm at a cross road on how to deal with my current situation.

I ideally want to avoid hardcoding each restaurants page.

My current idea for a solution is to have the restaurant-dir.php file contain a restaurant list. When a restaurant is clicked on,  some restaurant-page-builder.php will reference the clicked on restaurant's folder which will contain images (for food/drinks/etc) and a JSON object that will contain the info, menu, etc. to build the actual page.

I think my solution is fairly clean, expandable, and easy to add/edit/remove as all I would need to do is add a folder for each restaurant and provide the images and the JSON object.

"This is all internal on an Intranet

If it matters our stack is Red Hat/Apache/PHP. I use vim to make code changes but I have in the past mounted the server on my machine as disk and used sublime.

For the past 7 years at this company I have worked with one or two coworkers directly on a development server. This development server is setup exactly like the production server. For our website each user would have their own version of the site (Using vhosts) in which they can git push from, from there we can SSH onto the live server and pull down our changes. Each of these dev sites have their own DNS entry and SSL cert (Thanks to a SAN cert).

I believe this is unusual possibly even abhorrent in the web dev world however it has served us well.

The problem we're facing is our team is suddenly growing and I'm not sure how by how many. Our old strategy is causing some growing pains and I see a few solutions:

* Force all these new developers into a single site. This isn't as crazy as it sounds as most of what they'll be doing is simple html/css edits now and then.
* Keep doing what we're doing. Grow the vhost file and get a Wildcard SSL cert to cover all of these. We'll probably also have to do away with asking the DNS team to add each site. The new developers will need to modify their local host file.
* Get with the times and setup/learn docker.
* Something I'm not thinking of.

"A client wants to consume our REST-API in a very convenient way. They ask us to send ready to ship HTML directly (instead of the raw JSON we usually send).

The HTML would contain charts, that visualize the JSON data output, that would be retrievable with an  ""accept: application/json"" HTTP-header. Therefore the HTML contains a lot of JS and CSS as well.

Sending HTML is by design totally fine for a REST API, see [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10396057/should-i-pass-a-full-webpage-as-html-text-for-a-rest-get-call](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10396057/should-i-pass-a-full-webpage-as-html-text-for-a-rest-get-call)

The client could just render the HTML-Content and there it is on their site, very easy, but if multiple endpoints would be shown on the client side a lot of duplicate CSS and JS would be loaded.

Is there is a leaner and equivalently comfortable way to visualize it on the client side?Or is this maybe a totally fine thing that I shouldn't worry about?

Sometimes, the SDK might send a batch of millions of logs to Elastic.

I want to do this after inserting and asynchronously to not block the insert.

I want other microservice to pull from the broker, enrich the logs and update Elastic.

I want the pull to be of a batch of thousands of logs to perform the enrichment faster.

"Zapier automates tasks but you can also use it to offload some of the mundane programming tasks for you as you build your next big SaaS.

Say you want to send a welcome email when a new user registers an account. You could use nodemailer to set the emails up yourself BUUT why not just get Zapier to do it for you.

Here's what we will do:

1. Set up a Zapier zap with webhook that sends an email
2. Call the hook when an event happens in-app
3. Profit $$$
4. &#x200B;

**Step 1: Set up Zapier zap**

* Create a new zap and add **Webhooks by Zapier** trigger event. Make sure it is set to **Catch Hook**.
* Once created, Zapier will generate a unique URL for you that looks something like -[https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/9539273/bds3d](https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/9539273/bds3d)

&#x200B;

**Step 2: Call the hook when an event happens in-app**

* Create a utility function that makes it easy to contact the Zapier endpoint

&#8203;

    const axios = require('axios');
    
    export const notifyWebhook = async (url, body) => {
    	const res = await axios
        .post(url, body, {
        	Accept: ""application/json"",
          ""Content-Type"": ""application/json""
          })
    }

* Here's how to use it:

&#8203;

    notifyWebhook(""https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/9539273/bds3d2n"", {user: ""saasbase@gmail.com"", message: ""Trigger Webhook event""});

**Step 3: Profit $$$**

You can now trigger the event from in-app and use the object passed in as dynamic values for the zap action. For example, in the above case, I can send the email address and the message to send an email to.","webdev,web development,programming"

I try to dedicate anywheres from a minimum of 2-6 hours a day into coding, depending what my schedule looks like that day. Im forming it into a habit.
I'm going the self taught route. I started with freecodecamp.org and itnwas exciting, new and fun. But I quickly realized i wasn't retaining as much knowledge as I should be with it. So i grabbed Angela Yu's web developer bootcamp off udemy and that SKY ROCKETED my learning!

There's so many people out there attempting to learn and twice as many people who are substantially better then me! Why should I continue?!"" well, luckily I snapped out of that really quickly and made a list of WHY I'm doing this. #1 on that list was - im having fun learning something new and coding with an objective and seeing it in real time is rewarding and fun, it's like im.

"I am able to get interviews due to my prior coding experience; however, these interviews have all been for fullstack or backend positions.

These always go nowhere and here's why: I have little experience with data structures and algorithms. Any LeetCode type quizzes given me I do poorly on. I now understand that comfort with algos is necessary for positions involving backend coding.

My long-term goal is to be fullstack. My short-term goal is simply to get a job programming. I feel, given my prior experience, that becoming more comfortable with JS, React, and CSS would be far more effective in getting a frontend position than diving into algos would be to get a backend position.

This theory is predicated on the assumption that jr. frontend interviews stress algos less, and skill in JS, React, CSS etc. more. Is that assumption correct? If so, for frontend positions, I should mainly be focussing on JS, React, and CSS, right?

Well, something I haven't come across is a response REvalidator which performs one last check that the response doesn't contain anything which ought not to be there.


If some sort of SQL attack is successfully performed and an entire chunk of information is inappropriately captured in the response, I would love for it to go through some kind of proxy which does one last check before it's sent. In theory, whatever exploit which leads to the inclusion of forbidden data will have done its job by that point and won't be included in the response, making it 'clean', so if the response itself is validated one last time then some damage control is at least in place, along with some server logs to review what happened and whether it was an appropriate rejection.

"Hi everyone,

I am considering switching my career to web development, although I still don’t know much about it. I currently have several gastrointestinal and rheumatological chronic illnesses. I want to find a career that will potentially allow me to work from home and have a decent work-life balance so that I can earn an income while also having time to manage my symptoms.

I have a few questions about it, if you don’t mind answering:

&#x200B;

1. On a scale of 1-10, how is the work-life balance?
2. Is it possible to work from home?
3. Do you need any sort of official certification to find work?
4. On a scale from 1-10, how challenging is it to learn the basics of web development? What are the most challenging aspects?
5. How long does it take to learn the basics?
6. Are the basics of web development enough to land a decent job? Is it easy to find work?
7. On a scale from 1-10, how stressful is the job?
8. What recommendations would you give to someone who is a complete beginner?
9. Is it easier to be a front-end developer or a back-end developer?
10. Do you find the work fulfilling? Are you happy with the career?
11. Are there any specializations that are worth pursuing (Python, Java, etc.)?

&#x200B;

I know these are a lot of questions, but if you could answer even just one of them, I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much!","webdev,web development,programming"
"Most of the web apps I build end up having some form of an administrative settings page where the admin can change user access, create/delete users & roles/ and modify how the application works. 

Is there any proper way to architect the way this data is stored, accessed, modified, read, etc?   


My most complex instance of this is an employee directory for my organization. The front end is a simple search based on the name. But there is a back end that the managers log into to add/update/delete their employee's information. Within this backend, there is an administrative settings module that I've created so that the IT team can create users, roles, field lookups, etc., and the way I have this set up (IMO) is kind of dirty.

"For some context:

Our product is centered around one component which will be a part of a website. We have been working on the entire website, and have come quite far, but since we don't have too much time and our main component is the most important feature, we would like to buy ourselves some time by investing in a template. This component is one that we are currently developing, but since we are studying a lot as well, we think that we would like to use a template instead of developing a whole new website from scratch, just to add our component. We want to put all our time into creating this component and making it as good as possible, and we don't mind investing some money into a decent website template, hence the need for one. 

What we expect from the template:

What we expect from our template is for it to be fairly good looking, written in react.js, and to have some basic navigation features (sign in, sign out button + menu etc.). We also want it to be dynamic, as we want to add some extra components to the website, plus our main component. So, basically, we want a website template which won't have to be styled too much, so that we can work on the actual problem we are trying to solve.

Our research so far:

We like MUI, so naturally, we have been looking at their stuff, and feel ready to buy a template, but we wanted to ask some fellow asps and hackers for their thought. So, instead of bashing on us for being lazy, which would be understandable, what are some good website templates, that still allow for adding a lot of mechanics and function to it?","webdev,web development,programming"

Hey all! I started learning CSS and HTML about late august. I've definitely been pacing myself to avoid information overload and burnout, but so far I've been enjoying the journey.

I'm looking for some constructive feed back. Specifically about the next progression of skills I should be practicing?  For example: For my next project I am thinking about learning how to:
- implement drop down menus to the navigation menu
- Have a better coding structure because my css is definitely a mess but im starting to understand how it works
- beacuse i used flex, i want to use entirely grid for my next clone site to get a better understanding of it

I have used a wide range of technologies like MySQL, C# (.NET framework), Oracle, MongoDB, TypeScript, JQuery and vanilla JS.

As a fresher I had no idea what was in demand and how screwed I would be working as a vanilla JS developer.

I recently moved to NA to do my post graduation and have been looking for some part time jobs. Firstly, not a lot of people are looking to hire part-time developers, which is understandable. The ones who are looking to hire are only offering unpaid positions (I really cannot afford the luxury to work for free currently).

I somehow managed to bag an interview with a cofounder last week. It went well. I explained to him how I have only worked on vanilla JS and JQuery majorly but in my brief stint with Angular and React I was able to get onboard pretty easily. He was convinced. I was up for a second round with the CTO. And today this guy tells me that they are only looking for people with 2-3 years experience in React and decides not to take the interview.

"This sounds a little bit strange and I have to explain it a little bit upfront:

&#x200B;

We produce socks for business customers with their own colors, logo etc. Because we don't print the socks but weave them out of colored yarn we don't have every possible color. To get as close as possible to the color the costumer wants, we ask them for their pantone color and compare the pantone color to our yarn.

This process takes up some time if we have to do it a lot, so I want to create a browser based service that can ""calculate"" the correct color.

&#x200B;

My idea is to measure some key colors and calculate the values in between and output a percentage of how close the yarn color is to the original pantone color.

&#x200B;

Very oversimplified example:

    Key Color 1: Red -> Yarn 1
    Key Color 2: Yellow -> Yarn 3
    
    Input Color: Orange -> Output Color: Yarn 2

Or let's say measure every yarn (it's only about 40) and check how close every pantone color is to this yarn.

&#x200B;

I mean pantone already gives a percentage of how close the pantone color is to RGB or CMYK.

Maybe I could use these information for the calculation of our yarn colors?

&#x200B;

The end goal would be to input the pantone color and get the best matching yarn color (and maybe an alternative if the match isn't that good)  as output.

"Hi all,

I recently had a debate with one of my backend colleague. 

We have a webapp that uses an API. This API returns users, and users have experiences that need to be ordered chronologically when displayed in the webapp. 

My point was that the API should return the users with their experiences already ordered, so that the webapp can display the data as it comes. His point was that it's more optimized for the API to send the experiences as they are retrieved from the db, and the webapp will order them itself because it is less demanding in resource for the server (indeed, better do that same ordering n times on a n client's browser than do it n times on the server). 

We then ended up implementing a sort for the user's experiences on the webapp, hence making it aware of the API's business logic.

/verify endpoint - client sends token along with one time code. API updates token record as ""validated"" if one time code matches.

/api/ endpoints - all client requests have the token included so API end point can verify authorisation.

Where i am stuck is how to store the token on the client. The token will be valid for longer than a single session so it can't be in a variable. I believe this leaves either a cookie or local storage?

With the cookie i can set it initially with the /login response and can then rely on it being sent with all future requests. This seems like the easiest option.

With local storage i guess i need some client side code to read the key from local storage and send it in the authorisation header (or somewhere else?)?","webdev,web development,programming"
"Hi, Sass newbie here. Recently I'm making myself familiar with community recommended structure for Sass project, i.e. the well-known ""7-1 pattern"". I go through several articles and videos talking about it. One thing I've noticed is that in addition to the seven classic folders that hold different partials, generally there will be only one scss file (usually named as ""main.scss"") set at the root. Everything else is partial (e.g. ""\_buttons.scss""), which means that in the end there is gonna be one single CSS file generated.

Nowadays, a website typically has more than one page. For example, a website might have a home page, a login page, and a contact page. These pages need to be styled differently. If we only maintain one single main.scss and every style is put inside it, then we have to include the compiled css in every page. The compiled css can be huge and contain some irrelevant rulesets (e.g. "".login { ... }"" for homepage).

On the other hand, we can maintain separate scss file for each specific page, such as home.scss, login.scss, contact.scss and link compiled css only in the respective page. I use to do things in this way since I though each page should only load relevant styles. However, now this is kind defeating purpose of ""pages"" directory in the 7-1 pattern where we would put page specific styles into different partials (e.g. \_home.scss, \_login.scss, \_contact.scss) and combine them together in the end.

In your opinion, which approach would be better for building project based on Sass?

Thanks in advance","webdev,web development,programming"
"Hello,

I recently finished a small project of creating an animated rubik's cube. The user can rotate it around, and trigger animations that change the state of the cube.

My question is generally around the overall pattern I used to create the effect, to shake out any obvious mistakes in my approach and understanding.

&#x200B;

1. The user triggers an animation via a user event, which sets a CSS class on the HTML element representing a slice of cubes.
2. A setTimeout is scheduled to fire as the animation ends, which updates the state of the cube and recolors it so it's now consistent with how it would look after the animation. 
3. in useEffect when the recoloring and transformations are applied, the animation class name is removed.
4. There's a feature where the cube ""solves"" itself, in which I used a chain of asychronous setTimeouts to schedule a bunch of animations.

Overall it seems to work very well, but there are issues sometimes in the browser if you switch tabs affecting setTimeout. Largely it would be cool to avoid using setTimeout entirely. Would it be feasible to use **onanimationend** events without any setTimeouts? 

Thank you in advice if you have any insights to share","webdev,web development,programming"

"I’m a novice who's trying to write a program for a modal that plays a CSS animation for the modal everytime there's a trigger (button click event listener) but I quickly realized that once the animation ran the first time and the modal was removed, next time the trigger was activated, the modal would come into view but the animation would not take place. I eventually figured out that the animation could only be played once and the only way my plan would work would be to create a different class and then use classList.add to add a class containing the animation the second time the user clicks. But then again, I hit a brick wall because I would have to create a dozen classes in case the user clicks a dozen times. Now this is purely theoretical and the way modals work in the wild is usually they show up once, you click out or cancel them and you never see them again, but I'm trying to solve this because it could come in handy in a different scenario. So I was wondering if anyone could offer assistance with my code and explain how to combat this? I would be very grateful. Link to my code so far: [https://codepen.io/drblackjack/pen/poWxyQN](https://codepen.io/drblackjack/pen/poWxyQN)

But it seems a few things have changed.

* **Question 1:** It seems to be impossible to get youtube videos using the `<video><source>` tags now, and you must 100% use `<iframe>`. Is this correct? Or am I missing something?
* **Question 2:** I am following the documentation, and trying to remove all the ""fluff"" from the iframe (essentially, I want to create a ""thumbnail"" version that plays the video: no controls, no audio, no youtube logo, no ""overlay"". When you click on the thumbnail, you go to the full page view where you have the standard iframe: full controls, full overlay, youtube logo, etc.)

I have tried the following (where ""\[VIDEO\_ID\]"" is a valid ID)

    <iframe width=""100%"" height=""100%""
    src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/[VIDEO_ID]?controls=0&modestbrading=1"">
    </iframe>

But, I still see controls on the video, I still see the youtube logo, and I still see the ""overlay"" (the title of the video, watch later, share, etc)

I've tried with and without 'enablejsapi', different values, etc. It's basically always the same embed in the iframe.

Are the embedded videos impossible to customize now?

* **Question 3:** I also can't seem to play the video from my localhost. I don't remember that being an issue before.

My friend's birthday is coming up, and as a part of our idea to surprise them, we need a very specific site modified.

I have good experience with coding (mostly Python, with some C++, Java and MATLAB), but I know NOTHING about html, JS, or anything that makes the web go round. And my coding experience is mostly with scripts, so I barely know a thing about Github as well. 

 I read on the site's main page that what they do is spin the wheel to a very high speed, then pick a random angle between 0 and 360 to deaccelerate from. So all I need to do is be able to pick the angle myself. 

I found the [Github page](https://github.com/momander/wheel-spinner) of the site, and found the function that gives the random angle after spinning (static/Wheel.js/line 76), but I don't know how to run the webpage locally after modifying that part of the script, or how to do basically anything else.

"Hi all, with LeetCode popping up more and more often in interviews, I wanted to give exposure to companies that use other forms of interviewing (take-homes, pair programming, debugging, real-world coding problems, project presentations, tech discussions, portfolio review, paid trials, non-LeetCode coding exercises).

It's often assumed that if a company doesn't use LeetCode in their interview process, then they only use take-home interviews as an alternative. I'm hoping to break that assumption and other assumptions (""you're a bad engineer if you can't LeetCode in a live interview"") by making this website.

I source a lot of companies from the hiring-without-whiteboards repo but not all of them. I believe that there are so many other companies not using LeetCode that are not currently in that repo. For example, I've added 18 companies that aren't in the hiring-without-whiteboards repo, and I have many more that I haven't had the chance to add in yet!

"Hello everyone. 

Professionally I’m a Fullstack developer, using technologies like Angular and Spring. Angular materials to help with front-end, etc.... But I have a need to learn the most efficient technologies for a personal project.

I have been looking for a month for the solution to this question I have. I will explain the project I have in my mind.

I want to do a webscrapping, getting links on some products, and set up a website.

I don't know which technologies to use, whether to use React, Angular, Vue or whatever in the front-end part. And the same with the back-end (Laravel, Spring...). I would like to use a framework for the front-end on which to base the style of the web, something very minimalist, but I can't find something about it.

My idea is, through webscrapping with Python, generate a JSON file, pass the data to the database, and pass from the database to the web.

Any idea what technology I should use?

Front-end: ? 
Framework: ?
Database: ?

At least, they wanted to host EVERYTHING on DigitalOcean. Compare to Netlify and Heroku, where I can can just drag and drop my build folder for the frontend and type terminal commands for my backend. 

I have never used DigitalOcean before, so I'm a bit bias. I was thinking of using it to host some Discord bots I made, but I'm also getting three months of Replit and it's only $5 if I want to continue with Replit.

Maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Can I just consider DigitalOcean with my free credits the upgraded version of Heroku that won't shut off due to inactivity? Sorry of this is a dumb question. I feel like I just barely scratched the surface when it comes to deploying FULL STACK websites.

My end goal is to host my website on Netlify with my domain name and have it show case my projects and such. Which is why I guess I got DigitalOcean to help do this? However, I'm still wondering could Heroku not do this already?

"Hi, I wanted to get some ideas on how to achieve the following.

**Context**: We have a Single Page Enterprise Web application built using React + Webpack. We officially support last 10 Major versions for Chrome and Firefox only. If the user visits from an unsupported browser, we need to redirect them to a static HTML page mentioning we do not support the browser. The web app is a versioned app, so the customers install it in their servers and can access the Web GUI. At the time of release, we test on last 10 Major versions only. Lets say for this release the versions are Chrome V86-96. The application should support any chrome version 86+ only.

**My** **Solution**: I want to frame this as a browserlist query. At built time using Webpack, I want to inject a script which reads the query and creates a list of browsers which are supported. This script when injected would check at runtime the users browser and would redirect to static HTML page if the browser is not supported. 

I'm having a hard time detecting if the users browser matches a browserlist query. Something that comes reasonably close is [obsolete-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ElemeFE/obsolete-webpack-plugin). But it's not supported in webpack 5. So I'm leaning towards a custom solution, but the tricky part is parsing current User Agent to match a browserlist query.

Has anyone done something similar? I would appreciate any pointers or guidance on this.

"Hi all

Thanks for looking at my question.

Let's imagine I am plotting how many reddit comments people have made. In the results I have the following:

* Joe: 5 comments
* Mary: 0 comments
* Tony: 57 comments
* Jason: 15,200 comments

In this scenario you can see there is a huge different between the values. 

And we have this set of data too:

* Joe: 5 comments
* Mary: 0 comments
* Tony: 57 comments
* Jason: 120 comments

The results are now closer together.

How can I display both graphs side by side without confusing the user? And how do I keep the scale without things looking weird?

As an example, I can't have this, as 15,200 (Jason) is too big:

    Joe: -----
    Mary: 
    Tony: ---------------------------------------------------------
    Jason: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...all the way to 15,200

But if scale this to fit into a small size, then side by side it's not easy to see both graphs are very different:

    Joe: --
    Mary: 
    Tony: ------
    Jason: ---------------------------------------------------------15,200


    Joe: --
    Mary: 
    Tony: ------
    Jason: ---------------------------------------------------------120


Both graphs are now basically the same due to scaling.

Can any of you advise on this?

"Hi!

A client asked me to link their Shopify to a third party called Smoobu. They want that when a payment is done in Shopify, it sends an API call to Smoobu so it ""blocks"" the time in their calendar.

\- The information is sent to Smoobu API

\- The information Smoobu ""blocks"" the time in the calendar

We were talking about restaurants, since we live in a big market. Our questions is what will be a good way to implement online ordering with payments.   
My idea was to create it with gatsby and use either a pos system or some kind of ordering software. (My main concern there is scaring a client into spending more money than they need by getting another system they have to pay for)  


I have also worked with wordpress & shopify and although they are nice for quick turnovers. I don't know if that's the answer for everything. 

I have done personal projects with vanilla js/html, React, wordpress page for a friend's business. A shopify page for a local business. I don't talk about that though. lol My actual first client was terrible and pushy about everything and it came out looking like some tacky poster page. Haven't found work since.   


I think he really wants to have the actual ordering and payment methods hard coded, which I did express to him.

    const methods = {
      increment() {

      }
    }
    
    export default {
      state: readonly(state),
      methods,

    export default function useCounter() {
      const increment = () => {
        count.value++;
      }

The api endpoint for [Discover Twitter Spaces](discover-twitter-spaces.vercel.app/) is [Spaces](https://discover-twitter-spaces.vercel.app/api/spaces.json), pass Query param to the endpoint for data of different spaces.

`https://discover-twitter-spaces.vercel.app/api/spaces.json?search=bitcoin`

The total size of the application **97kb** is way less when you build the same application with Sveltekit compared to other frameworks like React/NextJS or Vue which give the same application size of **400kb**.

I already know my business model will be based on creating simple websites for specific niche, propably something like healthcare or any other that doesn't involve e-commerce, is repeatable and will be relevant forever.

I'm OK with building websites from scratch, but I know that if I want to be competitive, I need a system that will be quick, reliable and repeatable. That leaves following options:

* Bootstrap templates ( mostly 20-30$ each)
* Premade Divi/Elementor websites
* Wordpress themes
* Spending few months to write my own components and combining them to create custom websites

one word, accountability. I like to write down my journey so others can see it and I feel accountable this way. I am a solo developer so It is hard to keep going without any external feedback

I will mostly share my learnings so if it helps you, great, if not, I hope you don't mind.

What did I learn lately?

I have been trying to decide between cloud services like AWS or GCP vs self-managed hosting. Cloud services have come up a long way and offer a generous free tier. I will share a simple setup with GCP cloud functions and firebase hosting to host your project for a few pennies and almost zero ongoing maintenance.

Slack has a really nice dev setup that allows webhook-based interaction and API-based interaction. Webhook is a simple URL that processes HTTP requests. I will probably use the webhook approach for now.

I found that it is hard to get good domain names. I tried looking at expired domains websites and found some good .com domains that are cheap so don't rule out the expired domain method for your next project.

"I understand this might not be a black and white answer, though as someone currently going the self-taught route of becoming a web dev, something I come across often is people saying it's bad to spend too much time learning CSS, instead of moving on to JS + frameworks.

Currently I can make a responsive site with mobile menu (about the height of my JS ability right now), header, footer, content, etc. Can do all the basic semantic / accessibility stuff, can use flex and grid fine, 99% from memory, though there will still be a few niggles in terms of super clean breakpoints, and I'm still a bit shaky with which units are best for specific situations (there's so damn many), I would say my sites are 'good enough' but not something you would look at and be blown away.

The only pattern I notice is that the bigger the element (h1,h2,h3) immediately before a paragraph, the larger the paragraphs font is. But I still don’t see how this can have any effect when I’m using rem.

Also another weird issue I’m having is my media query is working backwards. So for instance if I set a min-width of 400px, those styles contained in the media query only apply for viewports smaller than 400px.

For my own projects I never really needed a CMS and when I did, I just made one myself. Yet for my first semi-professional job, my client constantly wanted little changes which with time annoyed me.

I looked into wordpress, but f\*ck that. One thing that stood out was webflow, so I tried it and I hated the visual editor, yet loved the functionality for the clients.

With webflow, CMS is actually really simple and well done. Also you can lock or unlock components which the client can change after its done, meaning, no more annoying messages asking you to change the color of a component, only to then later them wanting you to change it back.

I've also looked into headless CMS like Netlify CMS or sanity, but I think those are best for blog sites, not just portfolio sites.

When doing portfolio sites, I enjoy working with Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS or with Svelte and I hate using visual editors, coding just feels a lot more productive.

1. Designer have drawn app design and prototype.

But what is next? **Who should start develop API: frontend or backend?**

Logically, **frontend developer should understand** which data and calls should make to render data in design. Sure, there are Open API and Swagger editor. We are using it and it looks nice for small projects. When project is growing the working with YAML in Swagger becoming complex.

Yes, we are making special GIT repo for **Swagger**, making separate YAML files, etc. Then we add it to building on **CI** with publishing on [https://spec-api.project.com](https://spec-api.project.com) Backend guys can see requirements from this spec. But, it also hard to support further. For change something you need: checkout GIT, make commit, wait CI, etc.

**Is there Swagger like Google Docs or Notion by link? :-)**

Also, Swagger has no binding to design areas. I want select areas in app design screen and associate paths and models from Swagger. I always know where in design I am using endpoints.

Let me attach small sketch about idea. What do you think? Can it be useful?

"Hey there guys!   
I am a front end dev enthusiast and, as I imagine several of you, I usually set up a local dev environment so I don't have to do it all over again when I create a new project.

What technologies / packages do you usually use? yes, I know it depends on the project or more generally on what you want to achieve, however I usually fork a ""more generic"" environment and then trim it for the project itself, and I'm thinking of updating / rewriting this one.

Searching online I only find the classic ""create-react-app"" and similar environments related to the various frameworks, however I would like to create a more generic base in order to reuse it across various projects.

I'll start first, briefly describing the 2 environments of this type that I use:

1) Webpack, webpack dev-server, babel, postcss

As generic as possible, I use it for single page applications.   
I bundle everything together (importing the css via webpack).

2) Gulp-watch, webpack, postcss.

Pretty much the same thing, in this case I use gulp-watch rather than webpack-dev-server for an ""output"" issue: instead of ""bundling everything together"", I separate the css and merge the js scripts into one bundle.

This is/was useful mostly for wordpress themes or traditional web pages.

I'm starting to build a simple static website builder (something like [carrd.co](https://carrd.co)) and I was hoping to get some suggestions on how to implement the live editing and page generation parts.

I'm using Angular and so far I have a large library of UI components that users will be able to add/drag into the site they're building. My idea so far is to have a state (JSON file?) with layout info, component IDs and the content inside each component. This way they can save their progress or even make it public through a unique internal URL.

Another thing I'm not 100% sure about is how the website itself will get ""built"". I assume as long as users try to load their website from within the app, I can just load the saved state with all the info to build up their website dynamically. But what if they want to download it? Or deploy it to their own domain?

"Hey :)

New poll since my previous attempt was biased (thanks for the comments)

I feel like there is a growing trend that product owners like to test almost everything. Developers are requested to AB Test more and more feature, sometimes really small features. I feel this is a global trend.

It gives me the feeling that the product decisions are never the output of a clear vision but more: ""let's walk on eggs until we find the good thing to do"". It removes (for me) the fun of coding new features.

That and, most importantly, the fact that this is annoying to handle as a developer: It requires code splitting, code cleaning when the test is over. Sometimes, it requires additional unit tests for a piece of code that is going to be temporary. And every feature becomes a pain because you need to at least keep multiple versions working at once. It became a part of my daily work that I could have lived without.

"I'm trying to find a solution for the following problem:  
How to automate and speed up work on routine front-end development tasks.

So i wanted to gather some feedback from community if that's okay.

The original idea was to create partially or even fully generated interfaces.  
A tool, that will minimize the work of Front-end developer. Something that will generate widgets, that can be used in new projects (widgets like tables with filters, sorting and pagination, toasters, forms, buttons, different inputs). Big widgets, like tables can be pre-integrated with back-end.   
So with that tool, front-end developer job would be to configure where to put a widget, some styles and base urls, but, ideally, that's it.   
Something like Extjs, but not so overly complex and more flexible with the ability to use it in projects based on different frameworks.

I understand that customization can be difficult. If interface elements have predifined layouts and css styles, customization will be limited. But, is there a way to solve this problem?

Does someone have any ideas what approach can be chosen here?   
May be my thought process is incorrect and there is some other solution on how to automate routine task in front-end that you can think of?  
And also, as front-end developers, if something like this existed, would you use it?  
I know that for a lot of front-end devs its easier and more reliable to create widgets for their projects themselves (at least this is true for devs I work with), but wouldn't you want an instrument to speed up the work on routine tasks?","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

A typical situation involves transitioning an element in or out of screen, and slapping `overflow: hidden` onto the parent element.

However, it is a minuscule company(5 people) and I have basically become the tech lead. I provide code reviews for my peers, manage some of our small projects and create 80% of the apps by myself.

1) stick it out at the current start up and learn while “drowning” so to say. (I am negotiating a salary raise since I am handling more tasks than I was originally hired for)
2) try and find a job at a bigger company with more skilled engineers to learn from.

We think this is owed to the fact that so any font details are specifically provided in various different `component.module.css` files throughout the application.

Are we missing some best practice here? Should we instead have a single file (e.g. `fonts.css`) that stores all CSS properties for various kinds of text (e.g. h1, h2, para, description text, etc), and then whenever in our app we use text, rather than assigning it its own CSS, we just reference `fonts.css` to assign it its font?","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

Online Group course A - 200$ per month, course duration - 4 months (56H of HTML / CSS,  42H of Javascript, 28H front end)

Online single study course B (mosh web development) - 30$/month for all available courses (13H of HTML / CSS, 10H of Javascript, 13H react, 6H redux, 30H angular, 6H git / github, 5H devops)

"Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm just trying to understand the love behind Tailwind. I've been doing CSS literally since the days we switched to CSS designs over tables (i.e., since 2007ish). I'm not up to speed on all the latest and greatest features, but I'd say I'm quite proficient at it. Would maybe give myself and 8.5/10. (I could easily build out a design from scratch with no CSS framework).

That said, I've tried on a few occasions to jump on the Tailwind bandwagon. Although the framework itself represents a total paradigm shift in how I've thought about how HTML and CSS should work together over the years, I'm not opposed to the concept. I can even see some benefit to a robust assortment of utility classes. However, in my attempts to use it, it just didn't seem to make life that much easier. I'm wondering if Tailwind is perhaps more useful if you have a bit less experience with CSS. I don't mean that as a knock against anyone, as though it's only a tool for novices (clearly it's not). I'm just wondering why it feels so unhelpful to me, while so many other people seem to love it.

Edit: A better question might be ""how many years of experience did you have with CSS before starting to use Tailwind""? For me, it's nearly 15.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"Hi all,

It's as the title says, and I'm going to share a little context if it'll help give a better image.

I'm currently working an 8hr office job. The pay is low, but I can't afford to quit for financial reasons. On top of that, my parents are shifting the babysitting responsibilities of my younger sibling towards me.

The grind and hustle that's not going anywhere had severely burnt me out to the point my hobbies are also taking a backseat + other things I'd rather not mention.

I've tried self-studying and I've mostly covered HTML through FreeCodeCamp and the HTML section of an Udemy course, but it's getting harder to focus. I found a Facebook post of a company offering *free* training at the span of 5 months, a 1-hour required session at most. The cons is the pressure it might take over my schedule too much while working; I've noticed their alumnis' stories so far were people who weren't struggling a demanding job and can fully dedicate to it.

What I'm worried about is which route that is good for my current state? I don't want to worsen my mental health, but I do need a focus/solid roadmap, I guess? My environment has been a bit of a pressure that I need to learn and apply for a new job as soon as possible, and I get it, but... you see my dilemma? Haha.

"Assume that I am creating an app where I should display a /cars/:id page which contains the cars owned by a person with the **id**.

My problem is that should I fetch all the cars from the backend and store it in the global state and when displaying on the frontend, filter them using the id. 

Or should I fetch only the cars based the id on the /cars/:id page. But if I fetch them on the /cars/:id page, then how will I add them to the global state? 

Since only the cars with that particular id are fetched, adding them to the global state is a bit tricky. Say you append them, then there is a chance of duplication; say you replace the state, then only the cars of one id will be saved. 


How should I approach this problem?

"Hi everyone,

I know that hugo is a *static* site generator . Comparing to Nextjs, Nextjs has additional features to pre-render the page on the server using getServerSideProps.

I have an application where most of the pages are static and if I need to have some dynamic features, I can rely on javascript for that. But I'm wondering if the application requirements have changed and server-side rendering is needed on certain pages? How can I implement it with Hugo?

I like Hugo over Nextjs, because it gives a lot of features out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck if ssr is needed in the future.

One possible way that came to mind is to create my own server using nodejs, dotnet or which ever framework and serve Hugo generated html files + implement ssr on some other pages.

Is this a good approach? Do you have any working codebase which serve as an example?

Now after I got my first assingment about 2months ago(for a bigger IT firm) I was told today by me boss at my consultancy firm that I was gonna get let go in 1month from my current position and get put on the bench again…

It was a position that required me to work with ts, and since Im still a junior js dev, they said it should not be problem for me to pick up how they work since I passed the interview/code test they gave me.

Now after 2months they said that they were looking for someone who has more experience then me and that they are going to replace me. It was only me and a senior dev on this project and he will have to take over another project on 2-3months and I cant take over the project being this new. How common is this?

"Context:
I'm building a personal website with Jekyll and it includes a blog. I'm through styling most of it (home page and index of blog posts). The final thing I have to set up is the individual posts. I'm building from scratch as opposed to using a Theme but things have gone smoothly so far.

If you're familiar with Jekyll you'd know that posts are written in markdown. Now here is my challenge. When I started to style my page, in my main css file I set the root font size to 62.5% and I have used rem throughout to specify font sizes for different headers and paragraphs for different screen sizes. Now, the post pages has access to this css since Jekyll uses layouts to avoid repetitive stylings. When the markdown file is loaded with my css, it loses it's default styling and appears to take on the root styling. I have confirmed that this is the case by removing the root styling but of course I lose all the styles elsewhere.

How would you approach this issue and why can't I set the browser font-size to a 100% for the post page? I have found the problem but not understanding how giving our root a font size causes my styling to be ignored here, and as such I can't fix the problem.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

Is it possible to give an app-like experience in a dynamic mobile website?

I'm a complete newbie in this field, to be frank.

I have been tasked with the proposal for a cross-channel marketing campaign. For that, I'm thinking about gamification in the dynamic website. And this website will be mobile-centric, where I'm planning to integrate ""Supermario bros"" embedded code or any other Minecraft games.

My concern is this, is it possible to give an app-like experience on the mobile site..what i mean to say is, whenever an end-user is playing that game keeping his/her mobile phone in horizontal orientation, the game window should fix to frame as like in the app and that game window should not scroll down.

Are these things possible?

"Hey guys, so I started learning React 2 months ago and I'm pretty confident with my skills. 

But apparently in my area there are more angular jobs than react, so I think i'm going to make a shift.

Is angular similar to react? if you started from square zero, is angular or react more easy for first timers?

I practiced javascript a whole lot - making a lot of projects with just html, vanilla css, and vanilla js and the whole 9 yards. going into react and learning a lot of stuff was pretty easy as most of it was just javascript + html. The only thing i remembered that gave me trouble was 'lifting state up' but the react udemy course by max helped me with that. 

I'm kinda hoping for an easy transition to angular with maybe a few hurdles here and there.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

I'm currently cloning Pinterest's website with React and styled-components to study. But I'm intrigued with what they use for CSS, since each class name is reused a bunch of times. For an example:

    .gjz {
       align-items: center;

    .Jea{
       display: flex;

"Hey everyone!

I'm trying to get feedback on a project I'm building right now, and I'd like to hear what you think!

**The idea:**

Most form builders are ""black boxes"" that control all aspects of their forms, from design to submissions. My idea is a form builder designed to help developers build forms quickly and connect submissions easily. 

**How it'll work:**

The idea is to make a headless forms management system (FMS), similar to a headless CMS. You can configure forms super quickly using templates for common use cases, but you don't design the visual layout of the form. Then, in your frontend, use the API to ""fetch"" the form. The returned JSON includes all the fields, fields validations, and everything else you'll need to construct the form - effectively removing the need to every write form HTML again! 

Since you have control of the form, you also have access to the form submission and can handle it however you want with the option to send it to the cloud to be stored and integrated into other systems. 

Eventually, it will provide options for displaying forms with embeds and hosted pages, but initially, it'll be 100% up to the developer (with help from our SDKs) to control how the form is displayed on their website. 

I built a simple website to help share the idea - any feedback is appreciated!

"Hi. When I was learning and practicing frontend with webpack, I noticed that I have a problem with understanding the modules - components relationships. When I was doing my tasks, I've heard that my approach to it was bad.

How to name files and directories properly according to the purpose but accepted among the other developers? Like the names of folders: 'shared', 'public',  'utils'. Where do I look up for the full list of the accepted names?

How to pass/get callbacks in a good way?  Not that I don't understand the callbacks, but I mean how to share them between components grammatically? Example: there's a button in header, that changes the main page. The header and main are separate components. How do I delegate callbacks in a nice way?

In general what tutorials, articles (preferably youtube) should I watch to understand the coding environments, the mvc, mvv etc. concepts (preferably shown with typescript).

While learning and completing tasks with other students, I felt like I missed something, that other students were handling pretty well.

I would appreciate if you could give some links to tutorials with (as example) building a small landing page, but with component approach, using webpack, typescript (eslint) etc, where the page is built with separate components, where is shown how to handle operations between components (callbacks) like model-view-controller.

It's definitely possible to hard code that list, but then if they add support for other file types I'd have to manually update it, and I'd have to do it for each supported browser. Does something like my idea above exist?
If not, does anyone have suggestions for how to handle this? If I just try to render the video, and it fails I get wacky inconsistent results, like a video player with 0, or it'll become a bunch of nonsense characters. It's not a serious problem but it's definitely not as elegant as it could be.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"Hello frontenddevs

Unfortunately i am not one of you and that's why i am struggling with a seemingly very easy task. 

The Problem i try to solve:

In our company we have a Browser start Page that's just a simple htm file containing a few links for our employees. I received the task to add a search field to that page in which the user is supposed to type a city and then gets back a string based on a prepared xslx File where this city is column A and The the response String is column B. The xslx file is located in The same folder as the htm file.

The Problem i have:

So when i Upload the xslx file in The htm file with <Input> i can Upload the File and Work on the File with Javascript so everything is fine. But obviously The user is not supposed to Upload the file himself all The time but it should be loaded with the Page from the beginning. So i Tried to use <embed> but i am not even sure if something gets uploaded with this Command at all since it does not matter what i Type after src= There is never an Error.

So i am still looking for a way to upload my xslx automatically and maybe one of you can Help me. 

Thank you in advance.

Update: I just hardcopied the csv in the js file as a dictionary. Not beautiful nur apparently The only way to go.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"I was approved for a Java based bootcamp. However, I'm extremely interested in front-end and in the process of learning Javascript. The work prior to starting the course is a Java based and the course has not started yet.

The program does incorporate front-end towards the end but the basis and majority of the program is Java.

I believe this is a nice opportunity as most bootcamps are expensive. I'm currently learning Javascript on my own through a Udemy Course by Jonas Schmedtmann but I enjoy structure and have been looking at bootcamps for a while. I was interested in Flatiron School but as many of you may know, the tuition is extremely costly.

However, as I am in the process of learning Javascript, I'm suddenly having to learn Java concepts which is a language that appears to be math-based. It's a bit confusing because I want to focus on both but would like to finish what I started and focus on Javascript because I am interested in front-end.

I would like opinions from front-end (or even back-end) developers. Do you incorporate Java in your work? Are you familiar with the language?

I am unsure about starting the program due to my preference in front-end. I'm conflicted because it may turn out to be a great opportunity for growth and development but I'm continuing to do research and get input on the best step to take.

For privacy, I would prefer not sharing the name of the bootcamp but I would truly appreciate any input from developers.

Do you know if there is any tool to show designers where else a particular component is used? For example, we have a bunch of components, most of them are reused in other places.

I know some would say to balance those two stuff but idk it seems like I have to run an extra mile just for the group to make a progress because idk I'm the only one who is enthusiastic when it comes to programming and making projects. It's draining if your the only one thinking or making a step in creating the logic in a project.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"Hey guys. I'm pretty sure this doesn't break rule three since I'm asking for personal help and stuck with some stuff, but if it is, do let me know, my apologies!

&#x200B;

I have a personal website I've been building over the last three years for myself. It has blogs, photos, and other stuff for me. I don't have any social media so it's my little project on the internet to have something out there. It's pure JS/CSS/HTML, of which I knew nothing of when I started making the website (I'm a backend dev for years, so at least JS was easy enough to learn and the others took some time)

Recently I bought [this](https://codecanyon.net/item/miniature-earth-interactive-3d-globe-for-javascript/23390670) template to implement to my website, and so far it's been going well. I wanted to add a section where I have pins on hat globe for places I've been, and clicking them opens up an ajax short post (that crucially doesn't load unless clicked otherwise all the photos from all the pins would have to be loaded at initial start up) with photos. Without going into details, I have that and a few other issues I've bashed my head over for months now, and was wondering if I could find someone experienced with this stuff to get advice over a call to see how I can fix some things, and also maybe tips to where I can learn more since I now know the basics of this stack, but struggle on some more nuanced areas.

I'd be happy to compensate for the time. My sanity is worth something to me and for weeks now I've just wished I knew a front end dev i could sit down with and ask some questions to. Apologies again if the post shouldn't go here.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"I want to trigger either keyup.enter or a click when I tab over an element.

More specifically, for a work project we are using a component library that the client has developed. They requested that when a tooltip is tabbed to, the tooltip message pops up automatically without having to press enter or space bar. The problem is I can't really manipulate the css properties of the tooltip. My solution was to use a focus event to detect if an element is tabbed to, and if so, fire a method called showTooltipMessage(). In that method, I want to trigger an enter keypress as soon as the element is focused on, thus triggering the message to render.

Any help is much appreciated.

Edit:

This is what I assumed would work, but isn't. When I tab to the span element, it triggers the function and console logs 'focus', but it does not trigger the click().

    <span (focus)=""showTooltipMessage()""></span>

Just trying to gather thoughts here - i'm trying to do an ecommerce website for my portfolio. I drew out how each page is gonna look, made notes of which styles to re-use and how the site should look like from different devices.

I also drew up a  diagram of the variables - with dummy data - showing how the site needs to works with arrows going all over the place. This gives me a clear picture of what needs to happen.

Let’s say you have a page which allows you to enter details about someone such as name , date of birth, address etc. The user is able to use an edit button on the page and enter their details but after they have pressed the save button the page becomes read only preventing them to make more changes and the edit button disappears,

Lets say that the user used “inspect element” in their browser and copied the script/code for the edit button (and even the save button code) and after the page becomes read only, they are able to paste the edit button code on the page again and use the edit button again allowing them to alter their details again and the paste the save button code and allowing them to save the changes.

"hey guys, i'm creating a multi page website \[html, css, and vanilla js\] for my portfolio and i'm starting to wonder about my css file structure for a bit. i'm writing up this post because i want to know what i'm about to do is good/bad practice. also on what you guys would do.

&#x200B;

so basically to start out i'm going to have css files for each page along with the media queries under it. styles that are the same throughout the pages will have their own css file which i will link to for each page. i.e the navbar and footer will have their own css file as well as the reset/starter styles and each page will have that

all the youtube tutorials i watch all put their css in one file which .... :X

this is gonna make the code a lot more maintainable imo but what do i know. should i jumble everything in one style.css file or should i do the above? what do you guys do when you build out multi page websites.

also something else i've been thinking about: is it bad practice to group selectors, whose sole purpose is to center something,  and give it the display: flex center combo instead of rewriting it for each selector throughout the file? ","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"I got asked this system design question during an interview. I bombed it. The interviewer asked me to design a general search / autocomplete component, the one on the Facebook home page or the one on Twitter. It was less about the UI but more about the functionality and how it integrates with a backend. For example, what kind of API do you think it is going to be interacting with? How do we cache to optimize the performance? How do we report any bugs or do monitoring?

&#x200B;

I found there are a lot of system design prep materials for backend out there but I cannot find any for the frontend. Can anyone suggest any good learning resources on this subject? Or generally how I should approach this specific question?

&#x200B;

I know that there are some low hanging fruits:

&#x200B;

1. Denounce the user typing and maybe throttling the API calls

&#x200B;

2. handle out-of-order responses - race condition.

&#x200B;

3. Caching, both in the browser and in middle layer - in the client side I know we can use \`cache-control header but not sure if we can use CDNs to cache anything for such a autocomplete search use case

4. collect user metrics to reflect the customer experience and protect the customer experience by using alarms and monitors.

"[Talkr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/talkr) is a small i18 react package with the following features:

* typescript support
* auto-detect browser language
* auto-detect plural rules based on any language
* dynamic translations with multiple keys
* access deeply nested keys in json translations files
* 0 dependencies
* super small size (1.6kb minified, 835b gzipped)

The v3 now provides autocompletion for your translation keys. Now, you don’t have to worry again about searching the right path in your json files, or check if a similar key already exists.

In order to avoid any breaking change or potential performance issues for users with huge json files, this feature is optional. To use it, you only have to add a 4 lines config file anywhere in your app and you’re good to go. Please note the autocompletion is only available for typescript projects.

If some of you are interested in participating to this open-source project, here are the next milestones of Talkr:

* make it available on React Native
* add a complete test suite
* make it framework agnostic

"Developers like to debate about many things, but when I started learning programming, I had the impression the DRY ( Don't repeat yourself ) principle was not one of these. I was wrong. 

Fast forward a year later and I realize it is sometimes controversial. Some of my more senior colleagues warn about making things too DRY, as it can make everything interconnected.

"I switched employers 5 years ago to get into frontend. I ended up in a agency that holds design in high regard. Was excited to get creative. Learned a lot. Proud of some projects I did. 

Last few years were more focussed on profitability. Daily stand ups. Filling in timesheets. Making break downs. Answering to the PM. Making sure the planning boards are up to date. Completing checklists. I know those are supposed to help the process, but in reality they give me anxiety.  

The designs also become predictable, but not to a point we work DRY enough. So a lot of rinse and repeat. 

After 5 years, my colleagues switched positions or left the company. Updates to old(er) websites in a legacy CMS will probably end up with me more than the newer colleagues. GDPR updates to old projects are also the bane of my existence.

"Hello fellow frontenders, PM 10+ years of exp here. Recently, I was reflecting a bit about my career, about things where to improve and what works well. And I've stumbled upon this idea: front-end and app developers are expected to code great user experiences without an understanding of the basics of UX. I didn't encounter even five companies in ten years where companies would invest in providing UX skills for developers. And I'm not talking about some advanced things, like designing UI and everything, I'm talking about more basic stuff, like jobs to be done framework, or user journey mapping. Or even the core principles of UX. Usually, devs are left on their own on this.   
Given this situation, I started to draft out a course of UX for developers and now I'm a bit confused: maybe no one actually needs it? Maybe only actual coding skills are important? So I want to ask you folks:  
What's your experience? Do you think it's important for frontend devs to have a basic understanding of good UX or is it an unnecessary luxury? Does your company invest in developing dev UX skills (companies like to brag putting users first)? What's your take on that?","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

So ```page-wrapper```'s height is supposed to emulate a page that has some content on it, hence the ```height``` CSS property.

If I open the menu for example when I land on the page, so no scroll in yet, instead of opening it up top, ReactSelect is opening it at the bottom and scrolling me down to it.
I tried ```menuPlacement = ""auto""``` prop as you can see because from what I've seen in the documentation, it should do the positioning automatically, but it doesn't seem to work.

Hey guys!

I built an app for Spotify! Spotivity lets you see what music your friends are listening to from your phone without having to use the Desktop app. It's been a highly requested feature by Spotify users for a while now, so I took the time out and did it myself.

You can learn more about the app at [spotivity.vercel.app](https://spotivity.vercel.app/) and download the app from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arhaanb.spotifyactivity) now!

I put some thought into the User Experience and Look & Feel of the app, so do check out the [Behance project](https://arhn.us/spot-design) as well!

Let me know if you have any suggestions or feature requests that I could add!

Built with React Native and Expo.

Thanks for checking it out!","Frontend,frontend development,programming"
"Hello everybody!  
The idea of my code is as follows: there is a contenteditable `div` with contenteditable `spans` within it. Each span has a `box-shadow` style property that is set to `none` if its content were changed. In the past I used subtree modification event, but it got deprecadet in favor of `MutationObserver` and now I am updating my code.

So the code looks as follows: [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/3n8v10pj/1/). 

In the code I first define the callback. It is supposed to change the span style when the text is changed.  Then I declare the options and then I create a new MutationObserver for each target I want to observe.

For my use case, I need to observe both `chracterData` as well as `subtree`, so I declare those in the MO settings.

Now, here's the problem. From within the callback, the `target` is simply `CharacterData` node, not the target (`span`) itself. Then I tried to pass the `span` node itself into the callback, but that didn't work because for some reason, the callback can't take any parameters (can't be initialized like a normal function) and it knows what it needs automatically - probably because it's just a reference passed to `MutationObserver` constructor.

What's the solution here? I'm not a native JS developer, so perhaps there is a clever way to tackle this. Any help would be much appreciated.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"Hi everyone

I have a project in mind that i would like to implement but struggle with finding the right tools to implement it.  

What I want to build is an interactive graph. The nodes in this graph should be editable, f.e. if I double click a node I should be able to enter a text, or maybe change the colour of the node. Further the user should be able to move the nodes around and later on I also want to have an algorithm that places the nodes automatically for optimal overview. It should also be possible to zoom in and out, connect nodes with each other, create new nodes and so on. Performance wise it should be possible to display at least \~200 nodes at a time.    

What I struggle with now, is where I should start with. I looked up some libraries that may help realising this project like d3.js pixi.js three.js and so. But atm I am very uncertain what is actually the best technology to implement this type of highly interactive webapp. It does differ quite a lot from what I have done until now frontend wise, as I manly did SPA applications using React and Angular.

I started to play around with d3.js a bit but found it rather hard getting into it and I am rather sceptical if it really is the right tool for this job. As I not want to loose too much time finding the right tools, I wanted to ask if someone in here has some tipps for me.  

Should I may use plain canvas and js? Or should I go straight for big hammer aka WebGl? Or is it best to go for a library like pixi.js or three.js? Do you have some similar examples in mind that I may could look up to see how it is done there. Any tips?

Above that, you can see the loading of the font files and an image was stalled for 10 seconds. The stalling is indicated by the grey bars.


A similarity of all these stalled assets is that they were all asked to be preloaded using `<link rel=""preload"" ...`.


If you look at: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference/#timing-explanation


You can see that possible reasons for stalling are:


- Higher priority requests. (Preload resources should've been the highest priority, moreover preload is a declaration, not a hint)

- The browser is briefly allocating space in the disk cache (10 seconds isn't brief lol, especially on an SSD)

"Hi there, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree. I'm currently learning react and doing challenges on HackerRank. My goal is to be become a full-stack developer. And I want a full-time job asap due to weak financials. But I'm worried that it might take 2-3 years before I can land in a job. Should I focus frontend only ? By choosing frontend only, I can start applying for jobs in less than a year. Then, I might go for learning backend in my free time and then make a transition to full-stack dev job. What do you suggest?

"This will be my first post on Reddit, so apologies in advance if I missed some of the forum rules. 

I am trying to create a reusable component that accepts an `as` property, similar to a `styled-component`. This `as` property determines the HTML element to use when rendering to the DOM. I'd like to make it so that the props for the component match the props for the element specified by `as`.

For example (assume `abc` is an object like `styled`, with properties for the `JSX.IntrinsicElements`):

```tsx
// Ignoring the code style, as I don't actually expect people to use a `div` when they want an `a` tag

<abc.div as=""a"" /> // Will have the `href` property

<abc.div /> // Will not have the `href` property
```

I can already more or less type this properly using overloading, but I would still get the auto-completion for invalid overloads. My aim here is `dev` experience rather than strict typing.

As simplified example of what I have now:

```tsx
interface BComp {
  <A extends keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements>(props: { component: A; abc: string }): JSX.Element
  (props: { xyz?: string }): JSX.Element
}

const B: BComp = (p) => { /* define component */ }
```

But the usage is not want I want, for example typing:

```tsx
<B abc= /> // Brings up the autocompletion for the type
```

I'd like it only to be available when:

```tsx
<B as=""div"" abc=""...
```

I'd rather work in a calmer setting. I started the Codecademy Front End Web Developer career path. So far I'm at the point where they're introducing JavaScript.

I'm not looking for a time horizon on how long it'd take for me to get good enough. But moreso a path I should take. Would it be possible to get a remote job? Or is there maybe a website that I could do challenges to gauge readiness to apply?

I also have some experience using WordPress to build websites. I actually didn't like it that much but I think now that I know more (knowing flex box exist) I think I could do better.

    .grid-container{

.grid {
 display: grid;
 grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));

 display: flex;

Basically I need the logos to start underneath the sponsor level title and then once one is done, for example, Platinum logos end, the Gold should start below it and follow the same responsive layout. Why does Gold in my screenshot do something different when the ul has the same class on it since it is  coming for a forEach loop?

Nothing fancy, but in order to avoid making it in .NET (I prefer the flexibility of web dev over desktop) I want to make it in html/php. 

She doesn't want to consume cellphone data or to sign a contract for on site Internet, not enough consultations yet to justify the expense I guess, so the app has to be offline.

	\- Install WAMP

	\- Put the app in the www folder

	\- modify the hosts file to redirect some dummy website to the localhost/url

	\- Create an app (this I think can't be avoided) that checks

		\- if wamp is not running, exec it

		\- run the commands for apache and sql wamp services

		\- run some git command to update the code if necessary

		\- run the url in chrome or firefox or whatever

You can preview your designed webpages and easily export them to a HTML/ React/Vue components. This makes it very easy to copy and paste to your own codebase.

This is pretty easy to do, but what I'd love is a web interface to monitor all those steps and add user interaction to:
- run every step when we click (provided the steps before succeded)
- rerun some steps if we want to
- download the output of any step
- download, edit and re-upload a file anywhere in the workload, and use it instead
- show the steps in different colors, like green if succeeded, red of fail, gray of not ran

It's like a CI/CD pipeline or airflow but much simpler.

"I have a huge database 100,000+ entries that I want to make available to users (read-only access). They should be able to sort columns and filter them similarly to how it works in Airtable. Given that there are so many entries in the database, the data should lazy load. Moreover, the filter should work out of the box for different data types (contains, starts with etc. for strings; larger than, smaller than etc. for numbers; before, after etc for dates; multi-select in case there are just a few string options)

I can't use Airtable as it has a 50,000 row limit.

I found options like [PrimeVue](https://primefaces.org/primevue/showcase/#/datatable) but they all still require a ton of manual work. The same is true for libraries like [DataTable](https://datatables.net/) and ag-Grid. Especially allowing users to filter date columns is a huge headache in all the tools I tried. 

All tools seem to try to provide maximum flexibility at the cost of requiring lots of manual work to stitch individual components together.

Hey folks! I am starting to fiddle around with angular.

"I have been taking a webdev bootcamp course and I'm still working my way through html so maybe I'm jumping the gun but am I to understand that people are still coding this stuff by hand? Sure, I get that one must understand html and css and that things like Emmet take some of the pain out of it but in reality are people using some kinds of wysiwyg drop and drag editors that do 90% of the design and generate the code? I understand some of that code probably needs to be tied together by hand but developing a web site completely by hand seem unbelievably cumbersome and cost ineffective.

I'm going through some weird issues trying to adjust a font in my design.

As you will see, the X axis looks quite low. Or the x-height not adjusting to the size properply.

I've been having the same issue while designing on Figma, but read it uses a different line-height perspective. So I thought it would be fine.

It has a specific size and line-height set to 1. The ""25.3333px"" measure comes from the border styling (although I thought it should be 26px; 16px font + 4px padding top + 16px padding bottom + 2px border).

I've always added couple more pixels on the bottom padding, but here it feels a bit too much.

The font is Founders Grotesk, directly from the foundry.

I tested the same with Inter, and as you can see, it looks much more balanced. Although it is lighter and that helps prevent the weird effect.

"Hello fellow devs 👋🏾 

I had a question for people who already have dev jobs or are great at building a beautiful website.

My question is, can someone like me find a front-end or back-end job with my basic skills?

"TLDR; Is it absolutely necessary for me to learn more than 3 main languages for web design? 

Hello, everyone. I just started learning coding and web design a few months back and I have recently resigned from my other job so that I could become a full time web developer. I'm starting to grasp the concept of HTML and CSS and their importance in web design etc.. After this, I will be definitely moving on to JavaScript. 

My question is (applies to employees and/or employers): when I look up job applications for a web developer, they don't necessarily require us to only know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the applicants must know other languages as well to qualify for the position; may it be for juniors or seniors web developers. Why is that? 

I mean, I know that there are a plethora of languages out there and they are never ending and newer ones are always being made. But I thought that the basis of web dev will require those 3 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Will it be okay for me to ask why does the employer would want us to know or at least be familiar with other languages as supposed to the ones we actually know and are experts of it? 

I'm asking this because I have a poor memory and a somewhat of a learning disability and it's not easy for me to be fully efficient at something unless I'm already familiar with it. 

Any replies would be greatly appreciated.","Frontend,frontend development,programming"

"While working on an app for my website, I was looking for a publicly-available font selector input component for Angular and was surprised by how few choices there were. The few choices available were either not working, incomplete in some manner, or required bringing in external dependencies, such as jQuery.  Therefore, I've decided to create this component myself from scratch. To that end, I've published an npm library *\\@byte-this/ngx-google-fonts*.

This component handles:

* Loading the list of Google fonts, and combining with web safe fonts.
* Allowing the user to select from a drop-down-like list, where each font name renders in its own font.
* Allowing the user to filter the list by prefix.
* Emitting events for hover and user selection.
* Lazy loading all required fonts as they come into view.

In addition to publishing this component, I've written two articles regarding it:

1. [Getting Started](https://bytethisstore.com/articles/pg/angular-font-selector-component): this outlines how to install and use the component.
2. [Implementation Details](https://bytethisstore.com/articles/pg/angular-font-selector-implementation): this covers how I implemented the component itself in terms of data structures used, dependencies used, and overall concepts.

The project is also available on:

1. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@byte-this/ngx-google-fonts): with some basic instructions on how to install and use.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/ByteThisStore/ngx-google-fonts): with the source code and instructions for running locally.

Hopefully this is also useful to others who need a pure Angular implementation of this functionality.

So as far as I can see, my only option is to use something like cloudflare, which allows to purge the cache using Cache Keys.

So at the end, I would host my app on vercel, but cloudflare would be in front of it.

Our datetime picker shortens all weekdays to three-character long representations, so ""Sexta"" becomes ""Sex.""

"I'm a noob in vue and to start learning I had the unfortunate idea to start a project in vue 3, only to get stuck because of the surprising lack of 3rd party components. In particular I've been testing and trying carousels for 2 days in my spare time with no acceptable results.

So far the only 2 carousels I found that support vue 3 are: 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-carousel

A component with no events and no methods, completely useless if you want to do anything beyond the super narrow basic use case.

https://antoniandre.github.io/vueper-slides/

A component with a gazillion options, events and methods, a kilometer long documentation page, but without the basic ability to manage [content different than images](https://github.com/antoniandre/vueper-slides/issues/8#issuecomment-416794925)

Anything else either declare their incompatibility with vue 3 directly in the documentation, or were last updated more than 1 year ago. Is there anything else out there I could try? I'm on the fence about scrapping everything and rebuilding the thing in vue 2 where I could use the marvelous flickity carousel (holy grail of carousels IMO).

"Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

I need to build a real-time dashboard on the web from a database (perhaps postgresql), where it is possible to apply various filters to all the graphs in the dashboard (such as date ranges, minimum and maximum values, names, ...).

&#x200B;

When clicking on certain graphs or values ​​of these graphs, there must still be the possibility to drill down, thus displaying new graphs or values. Or even be able to apply a filter with this click.

&#x200B;

The dashboard is for integrating a product/platform on the web (it is part of a page). It must have a beautiful and responsive interface, and be as personalized as possible, thus distinguishing its visual appearance from the others (such as the kibana, metabase, tableau, ...).

&#x200B;

There is a very important criteria for the choices: I only have 3 or 4 months to develop this in localhost. And the choices to be adopted must have a light or medium learning curve.

&#x200B;

I've already done my research.

\- To build the visual appearance of the charts that will compose the dashboard, Chart JS seems to me to be the most suitable library: it has beautiful charts, is responsive and seems easy to use.

\- To develop the remaining front-end I thought about the React framework.

\- To make it in real time, I saw that GraphQL is used a lot. But I have no idea how to use it, I'll have to learn everything. Does it have to be done with something else like node.js for backend?

\- For data filtering I haven't found anything very useful to use with Chart JS... will I have to do all the code from scratch to apply every filter I want?

I'm looking for some suggestions on any API mocking libraries or services that you may use, as part of some research I'm doing.  


To provide some context as to why I'm looking into this; I usually use Mirage JS for mocking new / existing endpoints when working on a new feature but this can take some time to configure correctly.  


I'm toying with the idea of building a library that allows a front-end dev to rapidly mock a fully functional API, managed in the browser with UI. The emphasis being speed, by creating / managing models, relationships and endpoints with a few clicks and creating a local 'store' of preset scenarios.

But a lot of the replies to that thread talk about not using margin at all. They instead refer to just using flex or grid, and the gap/spacer  utilities that each come with. And that's where I got confused, because I use margin a lot and wasn't aware that developers felt a certain way about it.   


So, to anyone who feels the same way, would you mind sharing your perspective in more detail? I've also made a very simple design (Which I know how I would code using HTML and CSS) if anyone would like to share how they might build it out without using margin, that would be very much appreciated.

"Hey, this problem has been frustrating me and I just want to be able to close my 40 different tabs trying to work this all out. I'd be grateful to anyone who is able to offer any assistance

This problem sounds like it could be central to any package you are setting up and yet I still cannot work it out, probably since I have never done this before.

Context: Curlpp is a OO wrapper for libcurl so that I can make some basic HTTP requests with C++.

The issue: CurlPP (being a wrapper of curl) needs the location of curl. Cmake process is failing because it cannot find it. I use windows 10, and I have no clue where to put the package to make its existence known to curlPP. Linux and Mac don't seem to have this issue since they seem to have a nice location somewhere under their home directories from what i've seen, and yet every solution i've found online mentions these two operating systems as opposed to windows.

What I have tried:

`# Line 58 of CMakeLists.txt (I added the first 2 lines here)`

`set(CURL_INCLUDE_DIR ""C:/path/to/curl/library/curl-7.81.0-win64-mingw/include"")# set(CURL_LIBRARY """")`

`message(STATUS ""Looking for CURL"")`

`include(FindCURL)`

`find_package(CURL REQUIRED)`

I added the first 2 lines, they weren't there before (no solution anywhere mentions to add these). This actually does work and it finds the curl library, but then it seems no matter what value I set CURL\_LIBRARY to, it just fails (e.g. `-llibcurl`) , it says that the library cannot be found when linking. I feel like adding these 2 lines is the wrong approach, but don't know what else to do.

"For some reason VNC seems to be the most universal remote desktop protocol even though it’s known to be pretty slow.

It works on all operating systems and since it’s open source it has pretty accommodating support, for example RealVNC is one of the better iOS remote desktop apps because it has good command buttons like CTRL and CMD.

I know of absolutely no similarly ubiquitous remote desktop protocol which uses some more modern, faster protocol. I’ve heard of tons of proprietary versions - Duet Display, Jump, TeamViewer, AnyDesk, Chrome Remote Desktop, etc. Some of them are good in certain ways but they also have limitations you can’t get around because they’re closed source. Chrome Remote Desktop on iOS drops really fast in the background and has no command buttons; otherwise it’s quite excellent.

"I've seen a few people ask about this project but I've mostly seen psuedocode from people. The idea is that you start out with 1 pair of adult rabbits. It wants me to print a table that contains the months, the number of adult rabbit pairs(those over 1 month old), the number of baby rabbit pairs, the total number of pairs, and what month there will be more rabbit pairs then cages. There are 500 cages and each cage can hold 1 pair of rabbits by month 14 you will run out of cages with a total number of 610 pairs.  If anyone can explain to me how to create a table in python that would be fantastic ive figured out the Fibonacci part.

"Hi guys,

I'm working on a project for which I was looking around at documentation sites that I could use. I came across SwaggerHub today which I learned uses YAML files to generate the UI of the documentation site. I've also been looking into Redoc since we plan to use Bitbucket - however, integrating Redoc with our Bitbucket repository for the sake of 'automated documentation' requires a YAML file which we currently do not have for any of our supported webservices/endpoints.

So I learned that YAML files can typically created in what we call Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.0 formats? Correct me if I'm wrong on that.

I was wondering if there's anything that could easily generate such a YAML file given an (REST) API with all the specs and if there's a way that it's easily maintainable. This is in the sense if I was to add a new endpoint, would it be capable for adding to the YAML file in such a way that it covers the newly added endpoint and the REST methods it covers?  Or would I end up having to manually maintain this every time I add a new endpoint?

As of right now (not sure if this info will help), our webservices are being created through Oracle ADF BC (Business Components) so I'm not sure how easily, or if it's even possible, to use any of the source code in helping generate this YAML file. If any of you know about this or have worked with it before, feel free to provide me with any info that you have. I haven't been able to find anything on this anywhere.

Any information that you guys can provide, or insight, or even resources you can point me towards would be very helpful. Thanks for reading if you made it this far - just looking for a way through.","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

2. Manually log into the website and be able to re-run the program and extract new shifts and skip the already extracted shifts. I should be able to figure this part out with loops and if statements but I will need to find a way to store the already extracted shifts.

"Hi!

I have nodes. Each node has a price.

To proceed to the next node, i need to have enough money to do so.

I start from the first node. In the beginning i have 100 usd in the bank.

To reach second node, i need to have atleast 50 usd. So i make the move.

Bank now has 100 - 50 = 50 usd.

To reach third node, i need atleast 100 usd. I only have 50 left in the bank. So i return to the first node. Gain 100 usd. Bank has 100 + 50 = 150 usd.

Since i've already visited the second node, i don't need to pay anything. I actually earn extra by visiting the second node once more. Bank increases to 200 usd. Enough to move to the third node.

    Node A = 100 usd (starting point, so i don't pay anything)
    Node B = 50 usd
    Node C = 100 usd
    
    A -> B (50 usd required)
    B -> C (100 usd required)

It was basically a very useful templating tool where you could insert a bunch of text data(csv or other) along with a template string and it would interpolate the template to generate data according to the specified template.
For instance you could:
Insert 1,2,3 in the data window
Set ',' as a column delimiter
Set { ""id"" : %i } in the template window
And it would generate
{ ""id"" : 1}
{ ""id"" : 2 }
{ ""id"" : 3 }

You could also pass functions in the template string such as SUM, CONCAT, SUBSTR.
So basically everything you would expect from a templating engine, packaged as a windows App.

"Hello,

In [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core, when a request comes in and trigger a long-running task, i.e., calling an external API and wait for response, I use `await`, but that still hangs the browser because the request is `await`ing for the external response.

So, my questions are:

1. I would like to return ***immediately*** a page to user and update the page once the external API comes back later, instead of hanging waiting for that API call. How to achieve that with Razor page or MVC? Does it involve something like SignalR? (I've never used SignalR so just guessing)
2. how does it different from using `Task.Wait()` instead of `await` I know that `await` returns `Task` to its caller and continue the execution thread, whereas `Task.Wait()` would just stall the calling thread. And it's recommended to use ***async all the way down.*** But would it be different in the request response roundtrip in [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core? It would just hang the request either way.AFAIK, the only way to solve it is returning an immediate response, and then update the page once the API response comes back later using SignalR, like question 1 above.

At the moment, I am using chocolatey command to get last stable version of each software but it takes a considerable amount of time before I get the output.

When I was searching for an answer, I found some software that does exactly that really fast like ""IObit Software Updater"" for example.

So I am asking for a solution to get the last version of a software really fast. I would be very grateful for some advice or tools that could do that, thanks ! :)

I've been spending some time on the /r/Processing subreddit and that seemed to me like such a cool tool to play around with, but I'm unsure how steep the learning curve is for someone like me.

I have used PyGame in the past to make simple animations like a symmetrical mosaic drawing board or a very basic pool game physics simulator, but I noticed that there was a lot of grunt work involved when it comes to breaking down every movement and interaction as a sum of shapes and derivatives.

Is there a language/framework/tool that's one or two levels of abstractions up and that has some packaged functions to make things like animation easier ?

"I’m wondering what the best way to go about implementing a high bandwidth file upload service is.

Initially I was going to have a load balancer which validates requests, checks keys and forwards the requests to a node in a node cluster private network for some processing but this is limited by the load balancer’s max bandwidth as all requests pass through it.

So my next idea was to have all requests go through the load balancer, it validates and responds with a token and node IP and then the client uploads directly to the node. The problem with this is all the nodes then have to be public facing (+ potentially adding each one to a sub domain in DNS records for SSL). So someone can very easily do a lookup and see how much infrastructure there is (ideally would like to keep this private). 

Is the second method the way to go about it or is there another way?

My goal here is two-fold: get better at my current work, and prepare myself for future interviews. 

Fortunately, I have some time to spare, that I intend to use to fix this issue. Here are some things I believe I should learn (or at least be familiar with):

- OOP principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism) 
- SOLID and DRY principles
- Design patterns (clean, vertical, repository)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (no idea which ones though!)
- Properly learn what RESTful is
- Databases (go past basic queries)
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Entity Framework (performance, advanced usage)

I'm **not** expected to learn anything related to the frontend side of things, so for now I can get away without that.

Given a **non-empty** array nums containing **only positive integers**, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Here is what I have figured out on my own:
- Essentially, you are trying to find a subset with a length of (n/2), that is also equal to the sum of the array nums / 2

Hands, which are a subset of Tables, which are a subset or Tournaments.

I've created the idea of a ***tournament_registration*** table that simply stores the ***account_id*** of the eager player and the ***tournament_size*** of the size of tournament they're after.

Whenever a new ***account_id*** is added to the ***tournament_registration*** table for a certain ***tournament_size***, I query the table after the insert to determine if enough players have registered for a certain tournament size.

That setup seems fairly optimal.

Something just happened... I ran a program that I copied (stupid moment) that was meant to make a servo move while directly connected to a raspberry pi. B


ut I was not doing that, what I was doing was connecting the raspberry pi to a breadboard that connected to a servo driver (PCA9685) and now the power LED is not turning on unless I disconnect the GND wire, which is supposed to be connected.


Here's a video of what's happening to the hardware: https://streamable.com/0fdl7w

"I'm trying to deal with an ""identity fraud"" problem for linking social media accounts. i.e. lets say I make a blog, and you can link your social media and what not to your bio. Anyone can just link whatever social media profile they want, and pretend to be someone they're not.

Is there a simple Authentication API standard or pattern used to **just verify someone's identity claim?** A lot of OAuth2.0 APIs provide too much access and bring a bunch of red-tape as a result. All I want is an endpoint that verifies a user's identity claim, **and nothing else.** That ways users don't get prompted that we are asking for permissions to read or modify private data.

I am very new to auth flows, and trying to wrap my head around this, but can't seem to find a straight answer to this.

For example, Instagram's Display OAuth flow states:

>Note that Basic Display is **not an authentication tool**. Data returned by the API cannot be used to authenticate your app users or log them into your app. If your app uses API data to authenticate users, it will be rejected during App Review. If you need an authentication solution, use [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) instead.

Okay? They only have this and a business-oriented API. I don't want the auth info for SSO or anything, I just want to validate they actually own the account they're linking! And Facebook Login, the service they recommend, requires users to have business accounts.

Is my use case that odd?","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

"The college doesn’t go too in-depth about what we’ll learn in those two classes (they’ve just updated their website and it’s missing some info), but here they are:


Class 1) Video games


- Focus on code optimisation 

- Advanced programming

- Introduction to artificial intelligence 

- Dive into Unity

- Virtual and augmented reality



Class 2) Intelligent environment 


- Mobile robotics

- Image analysis 

- Nano-computers: Raspberry Pi

- Embedded systems and various sensors

- Vision, IdO, Drone, Robot and Cloud. 


Here’s a picture of what I’ll learn in my entire program (you can ignore the sentences in French): https://ibb.co/Px8NRKD 



I’d love to learn more about making video games and making my own one day, but I wouldn’t want to work for a game development studio (until the workers are treated better) so the things I could put in my portfolio after those classes wouldn’t help me too much in my job search. Although, they’d help me accomplish a long time dream. (And AI! So cool) 


The intelligent environment classes also seem interesting and would most likely be a lot more useful for my job search. I imagine the subjects in that class would also be harder for me to learn at home.

What do you all think? I’m at a complete loss. A side of me is leaning towards the video game classes, and the other side is leaning towards the safer route, which would be the intelligent environment. I’m interested in both, which makes this a harder choice.


Which one of these would be harder to learn by myself? 


Will what I learn from the intelligent environment classes really be an advantage in the job search?

I told my boss that this code ain't good to work with and build upon as it is uncommented and cluttered, so he said I should rewrite it. I didn't work with too much programming languages in my life, but im really keen to learn new (and modern) things.

Atm it's like 50 shell script files and depending on the task´ the program executes  4-10 scripts (they call each other), most tasks get started via a frontend built with plain html, css and php.

My boss wants that I use a compiled language, not an interpreted one for the scripts/program. I was looking into ""Go"", but have a hard time deciding if this is the right language to build something that exists out of multiple scripts/modules that call each other.   
\#edit: they might call each other with arguments, if that's important, could just write this to the database tho

Most of the time the scripts will execute terminal commands, wait for them to finish, log, calculate and move some files. The goal is to compile the scripts/modules and roll out the compiled non-readable version to our customers.

So i made an array which stores pointers which points to the modified cell, and when the player clicks on a cell turning it on, the address of that cell is pushed to the array.

"I started leetcoding for the first time. And it's been 2 days that I am stuck on the first problem I began with. Please bear with me and help me out. 

I am doing the Two Sum problem.

[This is my code that I wrote on leetcode](https://pastebin.com/NvxsHQKy)

**The Problem:** My code is producing the correct solution for the array input \[2,7,11,15\] and target = 9. **But it is producing wrong answer for array input \[3,2,4\] and target = 6.**

&#x200B;

My approach to the solution is -

1) sort the input array (I sorted it in ascending order)

2) Put the first pointer on the first (smallest) element in the array and the second pointer on the last (largest) element in the array.

Add both these elements and save it in a variable called sum. Then we have 3 cases.

a) If sum == target . Then yay!

b) If sum < target then make the first pointer point to the next element in the array. 

Reason: we need to increase the sum to reach the target. 

c) If sum > target then make the 2nd pointer point to the previous element in the array.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have a vendor saying that after Windows Update finishes installing an update which requires a reboot, Windows does not notify running applications that it is shutting down, and instead windows kills all running processes. Killing their applications causes it to corrupt currently open files. Their solution is that when we deploy updates to these computers, is to ensure their software is closed properly.

"New requirements are causing me to add 'boilerplate' to the first line of the program and last line of the program. The first line has parameters that I need to fill out. The last line has no parameters, I could automate it. The third line is really just changing an existing line from a hardcoded string to an attribute generated from the first line.

The change is nothing huge, it basically adds some nice features, but it also changes the output folder location(the core reason for the change). 

Compiling (using pyinstaller) might be automated, but I expect quite a few fails due to importing odd folders/files. 

I believe every program that we add this too, needs to be tested. These programs take between 1hour and 100 hours. I'm not sure its necessary to test each one in python before compiling it. It might be faster to compile everything and test, then check which ones failed. This would reduce my testing/hours of runtime in half(60 times to 30 times).

Finally, I was asked to include a progress bar, its super easy as I already have a class, and it only takes 1 parameter. However, this destroys any chance of automating the 30 files.

"I would like some feedback.  I want to experiment with putting Mocks in the test/spec for the class of the Mock.  In other words:

Given:

* Classes `A` and `B`
* `B` contains a field of type `A`
* `ASpec` tests `A`, and `BSpec` tests `B`
* `BSpec` contains variable `mockA`

So, normally `BSpec.mockA` would be constructed by `BSpec`. **However, I want to construct** `BSpec.mockA` **in** `ASpec`.

Example pseudo code:

    class ASpec {
      testDoMath() {
        # test code goes here
      }
    
      static A createMock() {
         mock = MockFramework.mock(A)
         mock.return(5).when( mock.doMath() )
         return mock
      }
    }
    
    class BSpec {
      testSomething() {
        mockA = ASpec.createMock()
        b = new B(mockA)
        # test code goes here
      }
    }

Benefits:

* All aspects of the contract for `A` are expressed in `ASpec` (not also `BSpec` and all other tests that use a mock of `A`)
* Breaking changes to the contract of `A` will be easier to track and handle.
* Less code duplication when creating mocks, probably.
* Less code to construct mocks of external classes (just 1 line per mock)
* Mocks can be used for testing (but not necessarily all the time).  Example p-code:

&#8203;

    CalcSpec {
      testAdd() {
        assertEquals( calcMock.add(3, 5), calc.add(3, 5) )
      }
    }
      

Downsides

* Test code is more spread out.  You have to jump around more files when writing a test.
* Mocks may be more specific to the test that uses them (e.g. `BSpec`) than the implementation test (e.g. `ASpec`)

Now, we want to up the ante, where we want to be able to ignore the document type when excel is uploaded (not through form but in other ways like from a folder, eg). Rather, the app itself will identify the document source and use the correct process to process excel.

In my team, tasks are created in micro management manner by the architect. It describes what to do in the code, like: move property or modify SQL table. It often describes things in code-domain specific language so it not so simple and it requires from me to guess what an author had in mind. At the end of the day, the feature don't work and I don't know why. Maybe it's because I guessed wrong or the architect had wrong solution or data was wrong. They expect from me to fix it anyway. 

I feel like I am some kind of human text processor not a software developer. I don't solve any real problem only these they are created.

When I talked with my manager he said this was because system was too complex to comprehend and if everyone would take part in creating a solution then they would be going nowhere. Each one will have different idea and they will lost time on useless arguments so it's better to have one person to do this. 

They said this is common practice in the business and I am not allowed to be mad about. Is this true?","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

"Okay, so I know this is a generalization that isn’t true in all cases.  I’m a yearling in the industry and I’ve both made enterprise and open source contributions.

But most open source code I’ve read lately doesn’t have nearly as many self-documenting features as the internal code base with my company.

We’ve got paragraphs heading every file explaining their purpose, in some cases there are function heading comments explaining inputs, outputs, special cases etc. sometimes dogbones between lines and sometimes large inline paragraphs explaining design choices or pitfalls.  By the way, there are no guidelines explicitly outlining this as a requirement, aside from the header comment for each file.

But in the open source code I read (lots of containerization-related stuff in Go or C/C++) there’s almost never any of this.  I perceive most open source developers as being more skilled than average because they’re under public scrutiny from other developers and representing their companies.  Maybe that’s inaccurate.  But it kinda makes me feel weird about how I comment as much as I do.

I have N groups of options. Each one has some number of ordered possible values, maybe: (0 1) (0 1 2) (0 1 2 3 4) (0 1) (0 1 2 3 4 5 6)

And so that means there are 2 * 3 * 5 * 2 * 7 = 420 total combinations, and I want to sample this just by having a particular number between 1 and 420 and constructing the items of each group.

My brain has gone to mush trying to write this in Python, but essence is this: I can multiply all the sizes together to get one extremely large integer, how do I programmatically deconstruct that integer into the index of a particular combination?

For example: if my groups were (0 1) (0 1 2) (0 1 2 3), I know that there's 24 total combinations, I know the first 12 are 0 from (0 1), and I know the next 12 are 1 from (0 1), and I can print out small examples of these just with simple nested for-loops with a counter index, and it makes sense, but I'd like to do this on a much larger scale.

"I'm learning OAuth and user identifying but the resources on the web don't answer all my questions.

Let's say I have this situation: I'm developing a  simple todo app with facebook login. The flow goes as follows with these roles:

todo-app-ui (browser application)
todo-app-server (server side, api)
facebook-api

1.	User logs in using facebook login and todo-app-ui gets the 'code'.
2.	todo-app-ui gives the 'code' to todo-app-server
3.	using the code, todo-app-server retrieves the access token from facebook-api.
4.	I assume I need a DB for users to link todo items to their users. I use facebook-api using the access token to get let's say this user data:

`{
  user_id,
  name,
  email
}`

Now I don't get what data I should store to the DB? I could store the email as a primary key. But what if the user changes the email of its facebook account? Then I couldn't identify the same user anymore right?

Another option is to identify the user by the user_id. But what if facebook returns coincidentally same user_id for user x that google api returns for user y?

We can create different users and put permissions on single tables/columns etc but that doesn't guarantee the correctness of the saved data and if a field requires a link to another table (for ex anothertablename\_id) we cannot be sure that the other row in the other table has been written

To perform analysis of my simulation, I am recording the coordinates of my particles (a 3-element std::array). I am writing my coordinates out to a coordinate dump file, using ofstream.

"Hi everyone. Last week, during my C programming exam, when we had two hours to solve some exercises involving a toy software (an inventory management software for a shop, in our case) my debugger stopped working and after trying to fix it during the exam, I wasn't able to do that, I wasn't able to ask a teacher to help me and as a result I didn't even get to half of the exam, being unable to test my code after writing it.

I was programming on a M1 MacBook Air running Visual Studio code. This was the best solution I could find since our teacher just assumed everyone was using Windows and told us to download Visual Studio. I was using clang as a compiler and a couple of extensions from the VScode marketplace to enable the debugging of C code. It had always worked, I have no idea what happened, but when I tried to run my program during my exam, it just kept loading and didn't do anything, without showing any errors or giving me any clue what was wrong. 

I am going to take the exam again in a couple of weeks, during which I am planning to find a better IDE/ editor for my purpose: I want to be able to write simple C code and debug it without problems, I want to know what is wrong when something is wrong. The programs we write are multiple files, yet simple ones, using just the standard library. I would even consider doing everything from the command line if it wasn't for the debugger/breakpoint setting side of things. 

The two options I am considering are Clion and Xcode, but I honestly think they are a bit overkill for my purpose and might add a little too much complexity than what I actually need.

A user logs into their user account, from here they can create (projects / vendors / account) \*account is different than user\_account\*  one user account can access many vendors through \`account roles\` lets say you wanted to add an item to the vendor in the back end, what are some suggestions on how I would go about making sure the user has access to the vendor securely (I don't want users without account roles attached to the vendor doing any CRUD on the records).

The current way I see it:

1. Pass session token to backend and get user account ID
2. Grab account roles from the database using the fl\_user\_account\_id to get all user roles
3. Check to see if the vendor is in a list of the account roles using the FK from the account roles

This seems like it's a lot of overhead to do this, especially the 3 hits to the db just to get the roles and vendors. I know I can inner join but I don't see an easy way to dynamically implement these checks in my middleware.

For some reason, everything is split between 2 different AWS accounts.

A couple months after I started here, it started having some big issues. Turns out, one of the AWS accounts hadn't had the bill paid because we didn't know it existed. (Former employee apparently didn't tell people.) So, I got that bill paid and stuff started working again.

However, since that time, we are now having issues where after we log in, it will sometimes say we don't have permission to access the page. However, if we hit refresh, sometimes it will load. Some of us have to refresh about 50 times before it will load. Meanwhile, other users in different parts of the country only have that issue at the beginning of the day, and then it's fine the rest of the day.

The issues are intermittent. I worked with AWS support, and they say it's not our servers. My boss doesn't think it could be an issue with the code because it isn't consistent.  Because of the location differences, my boss thought maybe it was an IP issue, but I can't find evidence of that...

"Hi, I'm very new to Reddit so not sure if this is the right place to ask but let me try.

I learnt UX design and came up with my own imaginary project 'Audio Tour app for an art gallery' and due to pain point I found, users prefer to have less interaction with their devices when using audio tour. So I think location-based app would be a great idea to track user's location and connect with each artwork.

What I would like to ask is:
- If 2 artworks are closed to each other, will the app be able to track the exact place where the user currently is and connect them to the right audio?
- Does location-based app apply to the whole app? (For example, if my app consists of homepage and audio page, while user is scrolling through the homepage and incidentally walking closer to one of the artwork, will it automatically connect to the audio and change to audio page?)
- Are there any optional or suggestions on which technology/method would suit the audio tour (ex. Bluetooth)?

2) Use Chrome browser to monitor HTTP request traffic when adding an item to the grocery cart to determine how to structure the request in my script.

3) Write python script to: 

* periodically login to Alexa, scrape HTML, identify all items on list
* If something new is on the list, login to the walmart+ grocery account 
* Send HTTP request to search for item on list
* use regular expressions to determine closest match of search results to item from shopping list.
*  send HTTP request to add the item to the cart
* terminate

"So there are statements in whatever language where you do normal things like:

* assign something to a variable
* remove something from an array

etc...

Then you put those in a block... that does something together. I guess as dumb as it might seem, should you worry about those sub-language-level steps failing...

I guess you could wrap the entire function in a try catch....

I'm just trying to make sure that I appropriately handle failures so that whatever app I'm working on continues to run/UI can reflect problems.

There is one other thing, say you have a recursive nested function, do you catch the entire process or per level. I will try this and throw some errors on purpose inside the nested functions.

If you have a looping thing, do you put an external check (other than say the main decrementer/incrementer) to make sure if something goes wrong with that, it doesn't just keep going infinitely.

**edit**

Thanks for all the insight

**update**

At the moment I was able to get away with one try-catch block at the parent-most of a set of nested call functions. Then I threw inside the nested functions to see if the top catches it which it did. The nested functions were generally async/promise related.

The solution configuration and platform are Debug, x86.
I have tried create two C projects from VS2019 and VS2022. (name: project19 and project22)
The platform toolset of project19  is VS2019, the other one is VS2022.

When I did debugging both of the projects in VS2019, the Autos worked correctly like below code.

I made some comments after executing each lines by step into.
Variable names and values in the comments are written in order from Autos.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int x, y, z;	// Breakpoint. x, y, z have garbage values   

	x = 5;	// x = 5, y and z have garbage values
	y = 20;	// x = 5, y = 20, z has garbage value
	z = 3;	// x = 5, y = 20, z = 3

	z = x + y;	// x = 5, y = 20, z = 25

	return 0;
}
```

But, when I did debugging both of the projects in VS2022, the Autos didn't work correctly.
it shows **wrong** name and values in some steps.
Also, a variable item **disappears** from Autos. I've checked Locals window at the same time, and it correctly shows them.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
	int x, y, z;	// Breakpoint. x, y, z have garbage values   

	x = 5;	// x = 5, y and z have garbage values
	y = 20;	// Name and Value are 5, x = 5, an item disappears
	z = 3;	// Name and Value are 3, y = 20, z = 3

	z = x + y;	// x = 5, y = 20, z = 25

	return 0;
}

I currwntly writing a parser for my customer syntax which I use for some configuration files in .NET. I would like to parse plain text files into objects.

As of know I‘m happy which my lexical analysis (tokenization). I‘m pretty happy with the parsing as well. I‘m using the tokens to generate an abstract syntax tree.

My plan now is to convert the AST into a object. There I have a few questionS:

- Should I even bother to generate an AST or should I generate the object directly from the output of the tokenizer?
- What is this step called: Converting an AST into some objects by propulating the properties?

If I then input another snippet that calls func, the tool then searches func for all `tool_assert` calls, and brings them up a level:

&#x200B;

    unsigned func2(array<unsigned,10> arr, unsigned x) {
        unsigned y = x * 2;
        return arr[y]; // tool_assert demands y >= 10
    }

So insert:

    unsigned func2(array<unsigned,10> arr, unsigned x) {
        tool_assert(x < 5);
        unsigned y = x * 2;
        return arr[y]; // tool happy

"Firefox handles very complex async/await + generators typescript webpack generated sourcemaps without an issue.

Chrome has a lot of jank as files get increasingly more complex.

1. Breakpoints pop in the non-sourcemapped source, basically all you see is the transpiled code.
2. Breakpoints sometimes just don't execute at all.
3. Sometimes breakpoints will dissapear on the fly as you set them up.

No such issue seems to appear on firefox, which makes me realize this is chrome specific as firefox works flawlessly, also in simple projects chrome works fine, it is only as there's a gazillion lines then chrome debugger becomes useless; it uses inline-source-map and babel; there's just nothing weird.

You may wonder why I don't just use firefox and that's because it is harder to deal with IndexedDB, and workers; I managed to fix the bug in firefox but I had to restart the browser several times because it kept caching stuff; so if it's not one thing it's another.","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"
"I have a use case which I suspect isn’t that unique, yet I can’t seem to find good methodologies and/or articles for.

My use case is that I often get projects sent my way that require different sets of programming languages. E.g. A few months back I had a project that required: python, and bash shell. I setup a local environment for that, to test things out, and that worked. Then a little while later I was approached to work on a project requiring ruby. Cue me figuring out and setting up ANOTHER environment and a different IDE for Ruby. Then someone came to me with a new project which required: Java, JavaScript, and C. Cue me setting up YET ANOTHER blasted environment (dev IDE, build systems, run environments) to do local development , trying to not mess up the other language environments.

Is there a better, OSS, way? I.E. a single IDE and a single platform to spin these environments up in? Like is there some sort of GUI IDE + Docker solution, or something else? Or is this always going to be a cludge?

"To me this shoudln't be possible, if a member is transient then those values won't be serialized. I am reading Effective Java - Third edition , and it is discussing the singleton pattern and if you want to make this serializable ( by implementing Serializable implementation ) you need to make all members transient, not just implementing the Serializable implementation. This sounds so counter-intuitive to me , and goes against my first very sentence unless I am misunderstanding. I'll leave a quote to the relavent section in the book here below

> To make a singleton class that uses either of these approaches *serializable* ([Chapter 12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java/9780134686097/ch12.xhtml#ch12)), it is not sufficient merely to add implements Serializable to its declaration. To maintain the singleton guarantee, declare all instance fields transient and provide a readResolve method ([Item 89](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java/9780134686097/ch12.xhtml#lev89)). Otherwise, each time a serialized instance is deserialized, a new instance will be created, leading, in the case of our example, to spurious Elvis sightings. To prevent this from happening, add this readResolve method to the Elvis class:

"Hi, I'm designing a new programming language ([https://L42.is](https://L42.is))  
In 42 we have both mutable and immutable elements, and thus collections can contain both mutable and immutable elements.

42 supports generative programming instead of generics, so I can not afford to have way to many functions in, for example, the 'list' type but I have to make other units of code when needed.  
Right now, I'm trying to design a library to provide general support for max/min/sort and other operations based on an user defined comparison criteria. It is hard to decide what is a good set of operations, for example:  
Should we just support a 'max' or we should also have a 'maxIndex', and a 'popMax' that removes the max in addition of returning it?  
Should we just support 'max' or should it be more precise and provide a 'rightmostMax' and a 'leftmostMax' ?

Also, should I make a generator for a single 'unit' containing all of those operations (and so, how could it be named?) or many generators one for each of those comparison based operations?

We are using the Augmented Lagrangian Algorithm for this, with a bunch of inequality constraints and size constraints. Our problem resides in the fact that the algorithm is violating all constraints. As an example of a size constraint,  we define that the inner diameter must be above 0 and the end result is a negative diameter. We also defined that the outer diameter must be atleast a constant value larger than the inner diameter. This is also violated, in the sense that the inner diameter is bigger than the outer diameter.

"Hi fellas,

I was trying to figure out how does the GTAV weapon wheel work behind the scenes (I talk about GTAV, but there are lots of games that implement systems like this one). I'm trying to make something similar, but I cannot figure out how does the weapon selection work. I mean, that very stupid thing of moving the mouse and see how the selection cycles through every weapon.

I tried to divide the screen into 8 pieces and and determine the selection based upon the angle of the mouse position. For example, assuming the reference point to be in the center of the screen, if the angle was between 0 and 45º, it should select the ""lower"" upper right slot (indeed, it should be between 23º and -22, because the wheel is rotated 22º clockwise, but it doesn't matter now).

The problem is that if the mouse is not centered (which happens often, it might be in any position in the screen), then its not comfortable for the user, because the reference is not the center of the screen anymore. So, I tried to take as the reference the initial mouse position, but this isn't again comfortable, since you don't do perfect circles around that point. When you play, you don't care about this stuff.

So, basically, can you think of any better approach? I think the best solution is to compute with mouse movement (the direction it moves and how much it moves to that direction) to compute the selected slot, but I can't think of anything useful.

1. Warns me of potential thread safety issues/data races during compilation time
2. Has strong inference type
3. Uses immutable variables by default, either by forcing me or warning me of unnecessary use of mutable variables
4. Works with existing C++ code

Yes there is Rust I get that but Rust doesn't seem to have as much support compared to C++ in terms of the available libraries out there.","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"
"Hi! Thank you in advance for reading my description.  
   
I would like to make a project that involves visualizing some basic sorting algos. I plan to begin with the heap sort and work my way up from there. I am no problem with the mechanics of the heap sort and implementing that, but I don't have much experience with UI and bringing projects to 'life'. I want it to be interactive while it is sorting, so people can see the actual steps involved. I know that will depend on the input too. Does anyone have any recommendations for how I can implement this. Ideally in java, but open to python or C++ too.

"I'm trying to write a program for my assignment, part of which involves opening a csv file, turning each line into a list and making changes to the list, and than writing the items of the new lists back onto the csv file in the format it was originally stored.

The items in the csv file are stored like this:

A1,A2,A3

B1,B2,B3

To open and create lists from the file, I do:

with open('file.csv') as f:

   lines = list(csv.reader(f))

A=lines[0]

B=lines[1]

Then, whatever needs to be changed in each list is changed. Then, I try to write the lists back onto the csv file by doing:

file = open('file.csv', 'w')

for element in A:

   file.write(element + ',')

file.write('\n')

for element in B:

   file.write(element + ',')

The csv file ends up looking like this:

ItemA1,ItemA2,ItemA3,ItemA4,

ItemB1,ItemB2,

So it works for the most part, but there are commas and the end of each line which messes up the program the next time I run it. I know this is kind of lengthy, but if anyone knows any way to write the list onto the csv file without the comma at the very end, I would really appreciate it.

"I have a text snippet like this one:

    Johnson,Brayden kickoff 61 yards to the EIU04 fair catch by Judd,Matt at EIU04.

From this, I'd like to extract some information like so:

    kicker: Johnson,Brayden
    yards: 61
    catcher: Judd,Matt
    distance: 61

Note that any other kickoff event will have a very similar text structure - just the players and the yardage will be different.

What I know is I don't want to go to the regex hell - I've added this specific event for example but I would also want to parse different types of events like Punts, Passes etc... They will also be structured in a specific way but the format will be different. I think regexes can lead to a real coding hell that will be impossible to maintain.

So I need some sort of a general solution. I have two high-level ideas:

1. Define a grammar for the text and use a tool like ANTL4 to build the parse tree which I can then use to work with the parsed entities (token). This will pretty much move the parsing complexity to the library. although defining the grammar might also be quite difficult.
2. Use some sort of a Machine Learning approach with Named Entity Recognition. My concern here is that the problem is not really probabilistic. We have a very structured text format and seems like there are strict rules which we can code to achieve 100% accuracy. This doesn't look like a good fit for am ML algorithm. Also this approach would require training and maintaining models etc... which is a complex task of itself.

1)  The Computerland Amusement park Rent ‘A’ Bike company has hired you to   
write an app(this just means a Java program) that will calculate how much to   
charge for a bike rental based on the number of minutes.   
a)  Your app should ask for the rental time (in minutes) to be entered from the   
keyboard. You may use either scanner or JOptionPane input dialog to get   
this input.   
   

b)  Choose ONE of the following. If you choose i) your maximum grade will be   
35/35, if you choose ii) your maximum grade will be 33/35. The difference   
between 95% and 100%.   
i)  Renting a bike at the ComputerLand amusement park costs $11.25 for 45   
minutes. Since it’s ComputerLand and complex computation is as easy as PI   
renters are not charged for the entire 45 minutes if they go over the time, in fact,   
they’re charged an additional $3.00 every 10 minutes and then $0.35 for each   
additional minute. A tax rate of %5 is added to the rental fee to get the grand   
total.   
So, for example, if a bike was rented by John Von Neumann for 127 minutes he   
would be charged $22.50 (2 spans of 45 minutes) + $9.00 3 periods of 10   
minutes + $2.45 for the remaining minutes for a total rental fee of $33.95 plus

i've been taking an online programing course for c++. and in the course they introduced the concept of the entity component system.  


and what i've got from it, ECS is essentially a form of OOP where the objects themselves are made of specific structs or smaller objects that handle certain activities within the object. like in a physics simulation, instead of having position, velocity, and acceleration (maybe jerk too if you really want to get detailed) as all seperate variables within the class. you create tiny subclasses that handle each individual component of an object, and selectively initialize the components in the object in which you will use inside of the object you are initializing.  


from my work in JS, prototype oriented does not seem that different. for last example, i could have a physics object factory function or ES6 class that could initialize a base physics object. and then to generate objects that have all of the components i want by simply building prototypes of the base object that have such components. 

i honestly don't see how ECS is any different from js prototypes. both involve taking previously existing objects and adding new components to them to make a different object that behaves differently","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

"Bittorrent clients require efficient and random file IO on small to extremely large piece sizes. Since its difficult to know what pieces will be requested by other peers or which pieces you will next receive, it seems like a difficult problem to perform optimized IO.


Usually the strategy (from what I read online) would be using memory mapping but to me it seems like memory mapping would be difficult to use due to the size of bittorrent files, and tiling the memory mapping would not achieve much faster speeds as pieces can be randomly spread throughout any possible tile with similar chance.


The alternate approach I would think would be to use some kind of buffered writes although for this approach I have a hard time seeing how that would be implemented.


Additionally I would be curious to know how threading/multiprocessing/event loops would help achieve greater throughput.

Yes, MongoDB is easier to use and probably faster to start a project, but the cost for an enterprise level is very high.

A single instance on a k8s or a single VM doesn't need to many efforts to create, but it's not very reliable. A homemade cluster is more reliable, but that takes too many energy for a startup company. There are only one cloud solution and for more than a developer edition, the cost is  impressive.

Yes, with an old school SQL database like PostgreSQL, we need to maintain indexes, we need to do migration and we need to use ORM, but the total cost (with SaaS solution) is pretty lower for a better quality ( developers need to know what they are doing).

    }
    let twice = multiplier(2);
    console.log(twice(5));

>Thinking about programs like this takes some practice. A good mental model is to think of function values as containing both the code in their body and the **environment** in which they are created. When called, the function body sees the **environment** in which it was created, not the **environment** in which it is called.  
>  
>In the example, multiplier is called and creates an **environment** in which its factor parameter is bound to 2. The function value it returns, which is stored in twice, remembers this **environment**. So when that is called, it multiplies its argument by 2.

"I am hoping to get some guidance on good practices for making requests to APIs that require access tokens—specifically when the API doesn't need to be visible to the frontend client.

For a bit of context: I am developing a web application that allows visitors to search for albums and view their metadata. I want to utilize the Spotify API for this, but any requests made to Spotify require that the user authorizes my app to use their Spotify account—even for the `/search` and `/albums` endpoints which don't need or reveal any private profile information. I don't want to force my users to create a Spotify account just to make a simple search. They shouldn't have to know Spotify is being used at all.

However, *something* still has to be authorized to make these requests. Since I already have a Node.js Express server handling requests from my frontend, I thought it might make sense to authorize this server upon startup and have it act as a proxy between the visitor and the Spotify API. The frontend would send the visitor's query to my server which, appending its access token, would forward the complete request to Spotify. 

So I suppose my question is: is this practice advisable? I ask because so far I haven't been able to find an example or tutorial that handles API requests in this way. Most that I've come across involve accessing account information, so it makes sense in those cases that visitors would explicitly give the apps authorization.

"Hello Reddit programmers, I come to ask for your help: I ​​have created a java program that runs fine for me, I decided to turn it into an android application. Basically my program splits ""double"" variables at declaration time. For instance:

`double Weight = 56000; // * This is the Weight in kilograms`

`double Size = 164; // * This is the size in centimeters`

`double BMI = (Weight / 1000) / ((Height / 100) * (Height / 100));`

&#x200B;

The problem is that in java it divides it as a ""double"" without generating problems, but when I do the same in Android Studio it rounds the variables at the time of the mathematical operation:  
 ""(Weight / 1000) / ((Size / 100) \* (Size / 100)); ""

&#x200B;

In a nutshell java does this:

""(Weight / 1000) / ((Size / 100) \* (Size / 100));""

""(56000/1000) / ((164/100) \* (164/100));""

""(56) / ((1.64) \* (1.64));""

""(56) / (2.6896);""

""(20.820939916 ...)""

Which is the correct result.

&#x200B;

But now Android Studio does them this way:

""(Weight / 1000) / ((Size / 100) \* (Size / 100));""

""(56000/1000) / ((164/100) \* (164/100));""

// Here for no reason Android Studio rounds what should be 1.64 to 1.00

""(56) / ((1.00) \* (1.00));""

""(56) / (1);""

""(56)""

That the result is all nonsense, and the error is that those that become ""double"" decimals seem to be rounded directly to an ""int"" integer.

I would like to know how I can fix or modify something so that the results of android are like those of java.","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

I have a little pet project ([IPS-Tools](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/IPS-Tools)) which I would like to migrate to a proper build tool so it can be packaged in Linux distros and become a real package instead of a personal pet project.

Compiling the project and installing works fine, but I have no idea how to use Meson to test the application.

"Hi,
I have been programming for a decade now, and I have to say at first  microservice architecture was very promising.
However there is a hidden cost which is the maintenance... 
I personally considering that a well maintained microservice (REST) should contain:
- readable codebase
- readable unit test
- integration test
- performance test
- api spec
- a postman collection ideally

Obviously all of the previous items should be up to date and consistent from a service to another... 
And I feel this is where we are all failing, because it's just...annoying to do..
This is  why now I  hate joining microservices projects, only on a few  project I would find great unit test but nothing more.

"**Situation:**  
I have been tasked with updating an older webform into a web app.

On the older version, there are search/filter textboxes/dropdowns with a button, radials specifying certain table names, and a field for displaying the table.

I have the filters working fine, and controllers written which can each independently display on the Razor table when assigned to it.  


**Table Code:**  
<tbody>  
  @ foreach(var ex in Model.ExampleController)  
{  
<tr>  
<td>ex.exampledata</td>  
<td>ex.exampledata2</td>  
</tr>  
}  
</tbody>  


**Problem:**  
When I click the Search button, I need it to display whichever Razor table is selected in the radials.  


However, I can not figure out a way to change which table data runs depending on the radial button selected, as even though Razor can use if/else or switch/case, I am not sure how to have it find the selected radial.  
Javascript can find out the radial value fine, but Razor can not that I can see, so that still doesn't give me a way to display the right Razor table data.","AskProgramming,ask programming,programming"

"This question has probably been asked a million times on the internet but I haven't been able to find an answer that is applicable to my case.

&#x200B;

I have a class with two public functions in it. Using a simplified C# example, it's like this:

    public class TimeStampConverter
    {
        public DateTime ConvertToDateTime(Int64 timestamp)
        {
            return ConvertToDateTimeOffset(timestamp).UtcDateTime;
        }
    
        public DateTimeOffset ConvertToDateTimeOffset(Int64 timestamp)
        {
            //Code for converting an Int64 timestamp to a DateTimeOffset object.
        }
    }

As you can see, ConvertToDateTime simply calls into ConvertToDateTimeOffset and returns a property/field that is inside its result. That is all. The problem, however, is that ConvertToDateTimeOffset is designed to throw a number of different exceptions if its Int64 parameter meets certain criteria, and unit tests need to be written to ensure these exceptions are thrown.

What is considered good practice here? Do I simply just write the unit tests for ConvertToDateTimeOffset? Do they need to be written for both methods and if so, how can this be done in a clean and centralized way?

Despite its extreme simplicity I don't want to just remove the ConvertToDateTime method, as a similar problem could come up in the future for a method that isn't as simple (one that calls into two methods, for example, or three) and I want to learn how to deal with it.

"I thought it would be fun to work on some retro style side-scroller or top-down RPG style game and do it in the browser, so I started looking for in-depth tutorial videos on youtube to learn about pitfalls, get inspired, etc.

Most tutorials are using canvas for rendering the game even though there is an alternative that sounds better for the job. I only noticed this when I stumbled upon a video that does not use canvas, instead it uses divs, CSS transformations, and background images to do the job.

A canvas-based solution typically has a render method that draws the scene from blank for each frame.

Sure, you can start optimizing that, moving the UI out of the canvas, maybe extracting the background layer into a separate canvas, etc.

But you can also implement your whole rendering engine via the DOM. With a handful of divs and some CSS manipulation, you could rely on the browser to do the hard work for you, even handle GPU acceleration.

"I am looking for a JavaScript module that I suspect doesn't really exist. I've been through the docs and repos of several different YAML modules, but have found nothing that appears to meet my needs.

I have an application built around a database. Because of this, I have definitions of the SQL tables, the data models, and an OpenAPI spec file (YAML), all of which have to agree on the size of the text-based fields. Every time I've tuned something, I've had to change it in (at least) these three places.

What I would like, is to be able to parse the YAML while somehow ""filtering"" each line to look for a syntax that would mean to do a substitution from a table of values. Where I declare the SQL and the data models, it is done with declarative code (so substitution is trivial there). It's the OpenAPI file that has me stuck. I have it currently in YAML, but it could be converted to JSON if that would make it easier. None of the parsers I've looked at seem to have anything like this, though.

Is there a package out there that I've missed? Otherwise I'll have to preprocess the file as a whole before I pass it along to be handled by the OpenAPI layer. Not that I find that too daunting, but I prefer to not reinvent things if I can help it.","javascript,js,es6,programming"

"I been wondering what are the differences between caching/saving data in memory inside a UI component vs. caching in client's browser vis HTTP's `cache-control` header. I think libraries like react query does the former - it stores the fetched data inside some global store and allows users to use `staleTime` and `cacheTime` to fine tune the data-fresheness. 

But I wonder if we can just achieve caching by leveraging browser's cache - what are the pros and cons with each approach.

It seems problematic to me that if we implement an in memory cache mechanism for a component or library like React query but it conflicts with HTTP-Cache -  says `Cache-control: no-store`, we should not cache it in the component or the library. For example, an QR code with a 30s validity. I wonder if there is a way to auto generate the config for the component or library out of the http response headers that the backend sends.

"So I am aware that there are primarily two approaches for authentication - sessions and tokens. And for sessions for I guess the session id is normally stored in the cookie that gets sent along with each subsequent request. And for tokens e.g. JWT it is normally a string added to the authorization header prefixed by `bearer` in HTTP header. 

My first question: for the APIs that the front end uses to perform CRUD on protected resources on behalf of the logged in user, should `userId` be part of the API signature. In other words, do the frontend develoeprs need to pass the `userId` when they make those API calls? For example, I have an api endpoint for updating a resource 
```
UpdateTask(userId?: string, taskId: string, updatedTaskConfig: TaskConfig): Task - POST /v1/tasks/:id
```
Should we omit `userId` since the session ID or the token (depends on which authentication approach we choose) is going to be enough for the backend to identify by which user this request is sent? Or we still need to include it?

Another related question is, I am aware that both JWTs and session IDs can be sent via multiple avenues (cookies, headers, request bodies, URLs, etc). Does that affect the API on the inclusion of the `userId`?

My second question is, for any CRUD operation, do the API calls need to include a `timestamp` generated on the frontend? Or it should be generated on the backend since the api calls can fail because of a number of reasons so that it makes more sense to let the backend generated the timestamp?","javascript,js,es6,programming"

\- Fixed testing functions (almost all of them were failing and now all are passing) - took me a lot of hours to fix the code as the code was outdated too. In order to write new test cases and make older ones pass, I had to modify around half of the core lib files.

\- Fixed the generate bitcoin function. Also added a new big int datatype.

\- Replaced fakercloud (faker was using it to generate random profile pictures and this also went down) by pravatar.

\- Replaced jshint with eslint and fixed all linting errors.

\- Coverage reports were not being generated, I fixed that too.

\- And of course, I renamed it. I wanted something unique on NPM, I credited the original author though. Renaming also take a lot of time, unfortunately.

2. If we are only talking about a client side rendered app or even a traditional website, then the HTML can be cached on CDN? and we should put CDN in front of the load balancer in which case?
3. I know that the static assets are stored in the blob storage like S3 buckets, but what are the actual underlying mechanism that updates the CDN with fresh assets?

"I'm building my own JS framework for learning and fun, a little bit like a simplified ReactJS.

Upon looking at how React JS handles events, it seems to add a few event handlers to the root node and then route them to the correct functions as specified in JSX.

So I can't decide how I want to handle events. I wonder what React JS' rational was for doing it their way. Certainly adding events using something like `myElement.onclick=handler` is much more simple, no need to route events or manage adding/removing them manually.

What would you opt to do and why?","javascript,js,es6,programming"
"I was looking into code splitting and lazy loading in [the react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html) where it mentions that

>The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspensecomponent, which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while we’re waiting for the lazy component to load.

I am not super clear on the meaning of  \`load\` here - does it mean loading into the memory or fetching over the network and load into the memory?

If it defers the fetching, then how do we know which endpoint to hit to fetch the split chunk from when the component is needed?

I came across [this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-lazy-imports-demo-5z40f?file=/src/App.tsx) on codesandbox where it has every tab lazily loaded

`const Tab1 = lazy(() => import(""./components/tabs/Tab1""));const Tab2 = lazy(() => import(""./components/tabs/Tab2""));const Tab3 = lazy(() => import(""./components/tabs/Tab3""));const Tab4 = lazy(() => import(""./components/tabs/Tab4""));`

"Hi everyone 🙂

We have created a Design System which is already developed with plain HTML and CSS, without any dependency like Bootstrap, etc.

Now we realized we have some components that requires  Javascript (like accordions, modals, etc), and we are wondering what is the best practice nowadays to achieve it.

10 years ago the solution would be a Jquery plugin, I guess. Maybe today the solution is not a library, but only a methodology in plain Javascript.

What's the solution in 2022? Thanks in advance.

**Update:** Web Components are not an option since our design system has 2 variants and one is made with Web Components.

So my question is, what are some of the tradeoffs between these two approaches, how is Client-side rendering and server-side rendering affecting these choices for styling? 

I guess inlining the CSS would make the initial HTML bloated but by sending separate files are we running the risk of causing a flicker when the user's connection is bad and the HTML renders without the styles?

"Hello! Recently, me and my friend decided to start a big project. We want to build a web application to perform analysis and show data related to crypto currencies.

I'll be doing mainly the backend, he'll focus more on the frontend. I am used to frameworks such as Flask and Moleculer, he's used to frameworks such as React.

We want to build a web application integrated with a MongoDB database with Mongoose. The backend will need to handle lots of request and data to external web APIs or socket and pass those to the frontend.

We'd like our app to be fast, scalable and flexible, especially on the backend. It will need to retrieve and display updates about prices and other metrics real time, with minimum delay. Also, it'd be cool to be able to export it as a mobile application and desktop application with Electron.

What frameworks and technologies would be best for a project like this? We're open to learn completely new frameworks if necessary.

We were thinking about MeteorJS as backend since I read that it's good to handle real time updates and tons of request with fast response time and React or NextJS as a front end framework, but I haven't read anything online about this MeteorJS + NextJS combination...

Do you have any tips to give us? Thanks in advance!","javascript,js,es6,programming"

"We have 3 ways to import stuff in modern JS (ESM):

    import Lib from 'lib'; // (1)
    import * as Lib from 'lib'; // (2)
    import {func} from 'lib'; // (3)

My use-case is this:

* `Lib` has hundreds of functions and I need only a few (like 20)
* those few functions have short names like `check` or `add`, so I would like to keep them in a namespace like `Lib.check` or `Lib.add`

I can do these things:

* import with `(3)` and rename everything like `import {add as libAdd} from 'lib';`
* import with `(2)` (or `(1)` if supported by lib), but that will turn off tree shaking

And manually renaming all imported functions is not fun. How do you solve these issues?

"Even though I've been writing JS for years, I never realized that ""finally"" block always runs within the function, even when ""try"" / ""catch"" block returns a value

    function testFinally() {
      try {
        console.log(""try block"");
        return ""return value"";
      } finally {
        console.log(""finally called"");
      }
    }
    
    console.log(testFinally());

Running this will log:

    try block
    finally called
    return value

Very useful in case you have to run a callback that may fail, but you have to do some required setup / teardown around the callback. Suppose you wanna do something like this:

    let isCallbackRunning = false;
    
    function runCallback(callback) {
      if (!isCallbackRunning) {
        isCallbackRunning = true;
        const result = callback();
        isCallbackRunning = false;
        return result;
      }
    }

Well, the problem is, if `callback()` throws, `isCallbackRunning = false` will not run, which means when you call `runCallback` next time, it will permanently get stuck and not actually run the callback.

So we really need to maintain `isCallbackRunning` correct at all times, regardless of whether callback function throws or not. So the way to do this is this:

    function runCallback(callback) {
      if (!isCallbackRunning) {
        isCallbackRunning = true;
        try {
          return callback();
        } finally {
          isCallbackRunning = false;
        }
      }
    }

What's curious is that, imagine `callback()` doesn't throw. Even though the result is immediately returned in the `try` block, `finally` block will actually run right before that, ensuring our teardown still gets called and making code simpler.","javascript,js,es6,programming"
"was looking at this [V8 design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T2CRex9hXxoJwbYqVQ32yIPMh0uouUZLdyrtmMoL44/edit#) where it has a section for `Constant Pool Entries` 

it says 
> Constant pools are used to store heap objects and small integers that are referenced as constants in generated bytecode.
and


> ... Small integers and the strong referenced oddball type’s have bytecodes to load them directly and do **not** go into the constant pool. 

So I am confused: are small integers pooled or not? 

My understanding is that it is not worth it pooling small integers if `sizeof(int) < sizeof(int *)` - because it is cheaper to just copy the actual integer instead of copying the pointer that points to the integer in the constant pool. Also variables that hold integers can be optimised to be stored directly in CPU registers and skip being allocated in memory first.

1. Build it on wordpress and I can then easily add back end functionality, payments, mbership, user authentication etc using plugins, even deployment etc is fairly simple. 

2. Build it using vanilla js, it'll be faster than react, simpler solution and I won't be able to add any of the above bells and whistles unless I hire the developer for longer . But I'll learn and Co build. 

3. Build it using react js. I'll have trouble Co building it probably all together. But it'll be a scale-able solution. Unfortunately it will probably cost more, take longer to ship, and like the 2nd option will not get some of the wordpress out of the box stuff.

While we are ~100 devs using it, something really prevents the adoption of new users: the lack of operator overloading.

Currently, for a simple operation or a simple condition, that's what we have to write:

    const myVar = Variable(0)
    myVar.divideBy(2)
  
    _.if(_.or(myVar.greaterThanOrEqual(0), myVar.equal(-10), () => { /* stuff */})

This is messy, hard to read, and not convenient at all. With operator overloading, we'd have:

    const myVar = Variable(0)
    myVar /= 2
  
    _.if(myVar >= 0 | myVar === - 10, () => /* stuff */)


This is better on every aspect. Here, I'm assuming we get Python-like operator overloading, where people use bitwise OR instead of normal OR which cannot be overloaded.

This is also why ML / Data Science are not popular in JS, because it requires a lot of mathematics which is very painful in JS.

"I'm trying to find a solution for the following problem:  
How to automate and speed up work on routine front-end development tasks.

So i wanted to gather some feedback from community if that's okay.

The original idea was to create partially or even fully generated interfaces.  
A tool, that will minimize the work of Front-end developer. Something that will generate widgets, that can be used in new projects (widgets like tables with filters, sorting and pagination, toasters, forms, buttons, different inputs). Big widgets, like tables can be pre-integrated with back-end.  
So with that tool, front-end developer job would be to configure where to put a widget, some styles and base urls, but, ideally, that's it.  
Something like Extjs, but not so overly complex and more flexible with the ability to use it in projects based on different frameworks.

I understand that customization can be difficult. If interface elements have predifined layouts and css styles, customization will be limited. But, is there a way to solve this problem?

Does someone have any ideas what approach can be chosen here?  
May be my thought process is incorrect and there is some other solution on how to automate routine task in front-end that you can think of?  
And also, as front-end developers, if something like this existed, would you use it?

"I recently learned there seem to be multiple ways to display an image on a web page.

The first way is to directly assign the URL to an image element's URL

```js
const img = new Image();

img.onload = () => {
  document.querySelector(""#myImage"").src = url;
};
img.onerror = () => {};

img.src = imageUrl;
```

Another way I recently learned is using `fetch` 
```js
fetch(imageUrl)
    .then((response)=>response.blob())
    .then((blob)=>{
       const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
       document.querySelector(""#myImage"").src = objectUrl;
})
```
I have a few questions about both approaches:

1. I am familiar with `fetch` but I normally use it to fetch JSON. The second way of using `fetch` to get the image seems to me like we are fetching raw binary data of that image file over HTTP, while the first one we are delegating the browser to kick off a `Get` request to fetch that image. But from the server's perspective, there are no differences in terms of how it sends the image down? Am I understanding this right?

2. In what situations we should favor one approach over the other? I feel like the second approach is going to have a lot of CORS problems than the first one, but not sure exactly why.

3. are there any other ways to display an image on a web page? I heard of base64 encoding/decoding a lot when people talk about images. Is base64 related to `response.blob()` i.e. the second approach? Or it is different? if so, can someone please give me an example of using base64 to show an image?

"I wanted to make some videos for youtube on a lesson topic, and originally I was gonna make the background graphics/animations using powerpoint. Powerpoint is handy because doing ""complex"" animations like fading in or moving around only require a single click. Unfortunately, powerpoint exports as a video in 1080p max at 30fps whereas I would like 1440p 60fps.

Another huge disadvantage is that animations can't easily be changed or applied en masse. For instance, if I work hard to make a cute entrance animation, it's not so easy to just make everything that appears on the screen animate the exact same way. And if I wanna change how that animation looks... I'm gonna have to change every instance manually. 

My friend had the idea of using something like javascript to do animations instead. I could use template everything to the point where I can just call `myText.appear()` and just make the `appear` function do exactly what I want.

"### Introduction

[CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS)(CJS) specification, released in 2009, is a JavaScript module format that uses `module.exports/require` and loads modules synchronously. NodeJS and [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) are the dominant implementation of the CommonJS format.

[AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api), which was introduced in 2010, uses `define/require` and loads modules asynchronously. [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) is the popular choice for using the AMD syntax in the browser.

---

### Headaches
I tried my luck to find solutions online, but most sources only scratch the surfaces when it comes to AMD or CJS.

1. With the help of RequireJS and Browserify, both formats can be used for browser development. Which JavaScript format is better for a browser environment, AMD or CJS? Basically, i fail to grasp the usage of AMD and CJS, and why one was better for browser and the other one for server side?
2. NodeJS implements the CommonJS Format ([Source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS)), which by specification should implement synchronous module loading. However, the origin of NodeJS is to run JavaScript code asynchronously ([Source NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)). Does this mean that modules are still imported synchronously? And if so, doesn't that conflict to the rest of the code, that dependencies may be invoked before they are fully loaded?
3. Since AMD specifies asynchronous module loading, is this then what Single Page Applications, such as React actually use under the hood to for [code-splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#code-splitting)?","javascript,js,es6,programming"

"I'm not looking for advice on how to do this. 

I know that you can make all kinds of applications through JavaScript and the best part is that they stay on the internet, so you don't have to install the applications. 

And so I was wondering if a stand-alone application is even possible with JavaScript. What I mean by that is that You will go to a website that is a word application, and now you can open and edit your documents on it like a normal application you would install on your own computer. 

However, what I don't see in today's website is working directly on the file. You always have to upload your file to their website. And it's as if there isn't even any real JavaScript working there. You can have all of that on server side.

Can you not make a stand-alone application in JavaScript so that you don't need a server supporting the application all the time? The JavaScript would just work on the client computer.

"I'm trying to build a DIY version of one of those [spinning LED image things](https://imgur.com/vIpbtYD). Basically you have an LED strip and you modulate the RGB values of each LED node as a function of the speed and position of its rotation and it creates some image of your choosing. 

I wanted to simulate this in JS to work out the basic algorithm. Basically, I was thinking Id have a div with some child elements to represent the LED strips. I would spin the parent div in a circle using css transitions or keyframes and I would write a function to change their color/rgb vlaues as a function of the angular speed and position. 

But I feel like doing this manually using css is kinda dumb and probably wouldnt work out. There's got to be some library to run simulations/animations like this with JS, right?

"Hey there legends,

I thought i'd share a project I've been working on for the past \~year.

[Make.cm](https://Make.cm), it hosts, hydrates, and generates raster/vector images, videos, html, and text from any web based project. A little different and easier than the many image or pdf only API's out there.

You can customise each generated output via JSobjects sent to the window. And consume it via easy to tweak GET URL's or Sync/Async POST requests.

I'm super chuffed with the SVG rendering because you can hide all kinds of heavy lifting (d3 or gnarly dom processing) behind high quality vector and cached output.

The HTML/TXT rendering functionality lets you make whatever kind of fetchable component you want via cropped static HTML or Plain Text - effectively stealing the output of any virtual DOM from any framework. Killer handy for mixing the output of many frameworks or just good ol fashioned web scraping.

I'm looking for the best framework to iterate a web app quickly, where there is a large plugin ecosystem and things simply ""just work"". Ideally, I would be able to just npm install things like auth, payments, etc. or the framework would have a method to bring this functionality into the app easily and quickly.

"We're working on an Angular application for a client. The client wants some interactions to be tracked by third-party analytics. We were discussing how to notify our app's analytics service that it should fire off a request. I suggested using Redux actions, since we already have Redux/Ngrx all set up.

My lead developer is adamant that Redux actions should _only_ be used to trigger state changes. If an event won't change the application's state — as is the case with firing off an analytics update — then it should not be dispatched as a Redux action. Rather, it should use some other eventing mechanism. This is to keep concerns separate.

Naturally I'm all for separation of concerns. But Redux actions don't feel that tightly-coupled to state. In other applications I frequently see them used for all app-wide events. In those applications there's one standard, consistent way to define and dispatch events. It's easy to keep the concerns of the events separate — just put them under different namespaces.

Introducing a separate eventing mechanism means that whenever developers are defining an event they have to think about whether it _may_ result in a state change, and often the answer is not always clear or may change with time. And of course it introduces additional technical complexity.

"I don't know what I'm missing here. I have a monorepo for one of my projects and went ahead and tried out PNPM and NPM workspaces along with [Turbo](https://turborepo.org/). These seem like cool tools when working locally for a few reasons:

* One `(p)npm install`
* not having to download the same package multiple times
* Being able to run scripts like `build` and `lint` across all packages/services/etc...

I think the benefits are cool locally but they become kind of a pain in CI/CD?

For example I ran into the following:

    - repo
      package.json
      node_modules

But now i'd now be reliant on workspaces to install all the packages (since it doesn't save lockfiles into each subdirectory) which would do more work than needed?

Instead of being able to just copy the service lock file into the docker container i'm reliant on the hoisted one, which makes the scoping of the folders kind of awkward?

\- Conditionally running post-install scripts. The user gets asked for a yes/no reply in the cli and the script is only ran if the user replies yes. This only mitigates attacks leveraging `postinstall` scripts and would negatively impact libraries that use it legitimately.

\- Forcing 2FA for all package publishers?

\- Explicitly allow/deny permissions in node. E.g. If I'm writing a simple http server, I most likely would not need to be using `child_process` and others, and thus deny that module/permission and increasing the security of my app. Maybe something like the `Permissions-Policy` HTTP header?

"Was checking out this article from Jason Miller [https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes](https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes)

where it mentions that for social media apps like Twitter, the ideal implementation is Single-Page Application with app shell prerendering & caching and one of the constraints is extended session depth and SEO

My questions are:

1. I guess I understand what Single-Page Application with app shell prerendering means, but please correct me if I am wrong - it means the html page is rendered on the server first, either on demand in response to the request or prebuild it to produces all of the static non-personal content, and leaves holes where the dynamic content will go. My question is, is this really how Twitter or Facebook implement their feeds or timeline? I feel like for websites like these there are no non-personal content - even ads are personalized. Am I missing something here?
2. As to the constraints - I am curious about how do these apps keep extended session depth? I actually don't quite understand what ""extended session depth"" means either.
3. Is SEO completely irrelevant here since the feeds or timeline is completely personalized so we cannot search from Google?","javascript,js,es6,programming"

"In [this freeCodeCamp exercise](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/generate-random-whole-numbers-within-a-range), the learner is asked to 

> Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.

The function assignment is provided, and here's my code:

    function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
      // Only change code below this line
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
      // Only change code above this line
    }

This makes sense to me. Basically; `(myMax - myMin)` sets up the length of the range between the minimum and maximum bounds, then you multiply that by a random number (which is between 0 and 1 (exclusive), according to an earlier lesson), round down to the lowest whole number with `Math.floor`, and add the minimum number, to bring that number into the range provided by `myMin` and `myMax`.

So if

    myMin = 10
    mymax = 20
    Math.random() = 0.5

We would have 

    Math.floor(0.5 * (20 - 10 + 1)) + 10
    Math.floor(0.5 * 11) + 10
    Math.floor(5.5) + 10
    5 + 10
    15

My question is why the `+ 1` in `(myMax - myMin + 1)` is needed. I would have thought that `(myMax - myMin)` would work. This is probably a really simple thing I'm missing. It it a guard against `Math.random() = 0` doing something weird? Or is it a ""trick"" to ensure that the function ""returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, **inclusive**.""

I'm working on an application for my portfolio which involves encrypting and decrypting some information. I'm trying to make it so this entire process happens client-side for security and privacy reasons.

My only concern is I'm currently serving some of this information through ejs and some views, but in reality, the code needed is bundled into a single HTML file.

"Hi, you all! I need some help with focusing my JS learning. I'll tell you my situation:

I've been recently hired on a job where I'll be programming sort of web games/interactive experiences. In that job, we'll be using JS/TS, BabylonJS, React, Redis and some other tools. The thing is I have little experience with JS (never touched the other frameworks, just a bit of pure JS with some HTML/CSS in university) and web in general.

I've been working 4\~ years with Unity/C#. I've also play around making a little game engine in C++/OpenGL, so I have, at least, main concepts of game development & game engines in place. I've been programming for 6\~ years now. I think I'll have no problem doing the job as long as I learn what I need from JavaScript/TypeScript and the frameworks.

So, my question is: where should I start? what resources would let me learn what I need quickly? I have programming knowledge, I think I can adapt with no problem to other language, so I want to learn the differences with C#/C++ and the typical tricks of the language. Also how to extrapolate my Unity knowledge to BabylonJS, what should I consider, etc.

Here is the line:

    const sleep = (timeInMs) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, timeInMs));

1.) Is this promise always going to resolve? Or is resolve a keyword? Does this mean that whatever value the promise returns, to use that as a parameter in the arrow function?

2.) What is the advantage of assigning a function to a `const`? Why not just use `function sleep`?

`console.log(""You pressed: "" + e.key.toUpperCase());`  
  `}`  
`}`  
`body.addEventListener('keydown', printLetter);`

&#x200B;

This code does exactly what I want it to. It logs ONLY keystrokes that are a-z or A-Z. It does nothing at all for any key pressed that is not part of the alphabet. Shift, Enter, Backspace, etc., all return nothing because the don't pass the regex test (though Shift will still work to get uppercase, it just doesn't return anything bc of the filter).

I can also call a function to validate the input and log it if it passes. This does the same thing as above:

`function validateEntry(e) {`  
  `const regex = /^[A-Za-z]$/;`  
  `if (regex.test(e.key)) {`  
`console.log(""You pressed: "" + e.key.toUpperCase());`  
  `}`  
`}`  
`function printLetter(e) {`  
 `validateEntry(e);`  
`}`  
`body.addEventListener('keydown', printLetter);`

&#x200B;

However, if I want to validate the input and then return the value, it doesn't filter out the non-alphabetic characters. It does log alphabetic characters but pressing Shift, Backspace, arrow keys, etc., logs ""undefined"". I don't want it to do anything at all, like the above examples.

`function validateEntry(e) {`  
  `const regex = /^[A-Za-z]$/;`  
  `if (regex.test(e.key)) {`  
`return e.key.toUpperCase();`  
  `}`  
`}`  
`function printLetter(e) {`  
  `let letter = validateEntry(e);`  
  `console.log(letter);`  
`}`  
`body.addEventListener('keydown', printLetter);`

&#x200B;

It's the exact same regex test so I figured it shouldn't be returning anything at all if it's not an alphabetic character.

Why is it doing this? And what would be a good solution?

In the image you can see the 2 rooms and the doors, the circle is the player and the arrow is showing the heading the player is looking at.

How can I calculate the ""correct"" heading so I can apply it after the player has entered through the door?

"I'm trying to do a ""Register"" page for a fictitious service, and when the user starts to type the desired username, I wanna check with my API if that user exists or not, in realtime. But at the same time, I don't want to overburden my service by querying everytime the user types something, so I've tried to do this:

1. When the user types one letter, it will call a function that will be resolved 1 second later using setTimeout.
2. But if the user types another letter in less than a second, it will cancel (clearTimeout) the previous check and start another timeout.

This is the code:

      const handleNickname = (newNickname) => {
    setNickname(newNickname);
    let check // i've called this because I had to declare it first before the next line
    clearTimeout(check);

"I'm making a game just to practice my skills and and see what problems I face. I don't have any future plans with this game, it's just practice, so I am hosting it on GitHub pages and will never add a database because GitHub doesn't allow it.

In order to save people's game progress, I'm using local storage which saves the game data to their browser. There is a button they can press to reset all of their games data, which allows them to get all the new features. However, if I add or remove a feature, there are cases where they would be forced to reset or run into bugs. Or I could add a chunk of code that checks if they're running an old version.

The way it works right now is the game initializes the stats, images, etc on launch. If the stats already exist, they are loaded from local storage. But if I want to change everyone's character's sprite without a database, I would need code to change everyone's sprite to the new one, but that code would only exist for the two friends playing the game on that specific version.

const activeLink = {
 textDecoration: ""none"",
 marginRight: ""50px"",
 lineHeight: ""21px"",
 ""& a::after"": {
    content: "" ' ' "",
    position: ""absolute"",
    height: ""8px"",
    width: ""100%"",
    bottom: ""0"",
    left: ""0"",
    top: ""18px"",
    backgroundColor: ""red"",
    borderRadius: ""8px""
  }
}
```
And i have some basic styling for nonActiveLink.

Where i try to implement it is:

```
 <NavLink
   to={""somePath""}
   style={(isActive) => 
                 isActive ? activeLink : nonActiveLink
              }
 >
   DisplayText
</NavLink>
```

Just to confirm that this type of styling works just fine with colors, margins etc. Problem is only with pseudo-class ::after.

Also, i didn't forget to give parent relative positioning.

It would be perfect if some of you had a solution where i dont have to install new packages because we are aiming for trimmed out version cause app is huge.

"I am new to js and was playing around trying to make a note taking app that would have wrapped notes which expand on clicking them. I have not completed it yet, I am trying to only use google and what I have learnt so far and am avoiding watching any tutorials. 

&#x200B;

I wrote this code to make and unwrap the note so far:

&#x200B;

    let container = document.querySelector('.container');
    
    function save()
    {
        let noteEntry = document.querySelector('#note').value;    
        para = document.createElement(""p"");
        textEntry = document.createTextNode(noteEntry);
        para.appendChild(textEntry);
        container.appendChild(para);
        para.onclick = function()
        {
            let body_coeff = document.querySelector('body');
            body_coeff.style.background = ""black"";
            para.onclick = function() {
                para.classList.toggle(""text-truncate"");
                body_coeff.style.background = ""white"";
            }
            para.classList.toggle(""text-truncate"");
        }
    }

&#x200B;

Clicking on any one of the paras performs the actions specified in the first onclick only on the last added para. But the second onclick can only be triggered by clicking on the last para, clicking on the other para's does not make the background of the para black.

&#x200B;

I thought clicking on any of the paras worked the way it did in first onclick because I created all paras using the same variable name but the current save() saved the last para, so it addresses all paras but can only change the last one. I am trying to figure out a way to go around that.

"i have a question regarding prototype inheritance and how should i achieve it in my own code

because here i wanted worker to have the same properties found inside person but what i got is some sort of shared property  between all instances

    function person(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    let w2 = new worker(""teacher"");
    
    console.log(w1.__proto__);//12th avenue
    console.log(w2.__proto__);//12th avenue
    

my only way of achieving inheritance is by doing the following:

    function person(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }
    person.prototype.address = ""12th avenue"";

    console.log(w1.__proto__); //{name:john,age:22}
    console.log(w1.name); //john
    console.log(w1.age); //22
    
    console.log(w1.profession); //teacher
    console.log(w1.address); //12th avenue

This functions works fine on browser console, and I got it from MDN. If I call it passing two strings like 'hue', 'hueheuh', it returns the longest:

`function longestString () {`  
 `let longest = '';`  
 `let args = [].slice.call(arguments);`

 `if (args[i].length > longest.length) {`

However, when trying to put it on the page, it doesn't. A button triggers an event listener, and converts it to an array:

`inputStringBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {`  
 `const myInput = inputString.value.split("","");`  
`longestString(myInput);`  
`});`

console.log for arguments returns:

`​​1: "" hueheuh""`

"Hey all,

I'm currently learning about Node.js on the Odin Project, so still relatively green with programming. Something I've noticed is that when you run a file with imports, Node will execute the full contents of the exporting file. I think I reasonably understand the explanations on why this is. 

My question is this:  does Webpack *not* do this? I know that Webpack wraps the contents of each file in an IIFE, but shouldn't this still execute the contents when it's calling import/export? Or is it that Webpack is using Node to execute the files in a different environment than they are intended, so there is no appreciable output?

I apologize if this question seems like nonsense, I just was surprised to see Node run the contents of the exporting file, when if something like that happens with Webpack, it doesn't really seem noticeable until after it's bundled and offered to the browser.

"I have a simple JS code which converts a word ending in **eable** to **able**, for example, **loveable** -> **lovable**.

"I'm getting into validating user input and am a bit stuck when it comes to SQL injections and the like (I use MongoDB). 

I use Auth0 for user management, so I don't check anything on the log in screen.

The things I do want to check are HTML fields for numbers, short text fields, a selection list and a text box for messages.

I have this, using express-validator:

For the short number fields: 

    check('fieldName').isNumeric().isLength({ max: 4 })


For a short text field: 

    check('searchName').exists().isAlphanumeric().isLength({ min: 5, max: 15 })

For messages:

- How do I handle the injection issue? validatorjs has two sanitizers called blacklist and escape, should I use these to blacklist characters like $ and &, or escape them?
- How can I validate the input from a selection list? I assume with equals(), but how do you properly chain that to check for all 5 strings in my list?

"Time and time again, I see people criticizing the major front-end frameworks for bloating the web and hogging their RAM. ""You can write vanilla JS!"" They say. But what's the point?

I need to write a basic SPA with a couple of text inputs, some checkboxes, and a button. I need to update the UI whenever the user interacts with the controls or clicks the button. Some animations would be great.

I can wire them together, manipulating the DOM directly inside event handlers (remember jQuery) and call it a day. But it's unsatisfactory, because:

- State is scattered throughout the DOM, plus some global variables
- No components. The UI is one sprawling HTML file and one CSS file
- Logic and view code spaghettified inside event handlers

Reusability and modularity counts, right? So I take ideas from existing front-end frameworks and...

1. Extract the state out of the DOM
2. Split the UI into components
3. Separate DOM manipulation from business logic

Congratulations! I created my own take on React/Vue/Angular/Svelte. But my ""framework"" is less tested, less optimized, doesn't handle edge cases well, has less tooling support, and nobody wants to touch it. In one year I will forget how the thing works.

Do I want to maintain my new front-end framework with a user count of 1? Would anyone want to contribute to my open source project?

I just started looking for a new job. As a part of that job search, I've been doing a Algorithm and Data Structures course. As I'm going through that course, I'm realizing that there are abstractions that I can do using things like iterators or generators, that make life a bit easier to deal with.

For example, when working with a `LinkedList` I'm seriously too lazy to do

```
let curr = this.head

while (curr) {

    curr = curr.next;

}
```

everywhere and instead wrote this abstraction:

```
*iter() {
   let curr = this.head;

   while (curr) {

        yield curr;
        curr = curr.next;
   }
}
```

Which let's me change that while loop above to simply

```
for (const node of this.iter()) {
    ...
}
```

So it isn't like I don't know _how_ to do it the ""normal"" or ""traditional"" way, but the abstraction, in my opinion, makes it so I don't have to think about using a `while` loop more than once. I can even explain how and why something like this works. I use this kind of stuff quite a bit in my day to day job, or rather I had to learn a lot about iterators and generators and stuff as a part of my day job.

The question, then, is is this sort of thing ""too advanced"" for an interview and does it have the potential to make myself look like a ""show off"", possibly losing me a chance at the position? Or should I just not worry about it?","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

"Hi all.  I've built a Node app, and am adding unit tests.  In my unit test file I need to create a mock DOM which has support for `<script type='module'>` tags.  In other words, into my mock DOM I need to insert HTML which loads JS via a `<script type='module'>` tag.  Unfortunately [jsdom does not have such support](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2475).  Does anyone know of an alternative mock DOM package that provides such support?

If not, how might I get around this issue?  Would I have to refactor my code so it does not use such a tag?  Or at least, refactor things so my unit tests don't depend on that tag?

FYI I'm using Tape as my test runner, and I'd prefer to continue to do so (rather than switching to Jest).

"LeetCode question: [https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

  
So a string of various roman numerals is read in and you are supposed to output the value of the roman numerals converted to numbers. I understand the map portion and the value starting at zero for the function. What I don't understand is why is i+=1 and not i++ a normal incrementation. Also i don't quit follow how the ternary operator is working, as long as symbols\[s\[i\]\] < symbols\[s\[i+1\]\] ? value -= symbols\[s\[i\]\] (truthy) : value += symbols\[s\[i\]\] (falsy) . Shouldn't it be the other way around for the truthy and falsy values for the ternary operator?

"Hey everyone,

So recently like many of you I've been going through The Odin Project. I really like the material, the projects, and mostly the exercises to get me more familiar with plain JavaScript and the different methods you can use to get a problem solved. All of them are challenging in their own way but there were two that really had me stumped to the point I just couldn't do them. 

One of the exercises that had me stuck was called the Fibonacci sequence, I tried for 2 days googling different ways to create a loop that could solve this without looking up the answer. I still couldn't figure it out so eventually I skipped it and moved on. 

The next one was called GetTheOldest where you need to loop through an array of objects and return the oldest person based on their year of birth and year of death. This seemed easy enough but I could not for the life of me figure it out. Eventually I saw someone's code on stack overflow and used it and it worked. I didn't want to use someone else's code as I wanted to figure it out myself but I did take the time to look through their code and understand what it was doing. 

My question is when you get stuck on a hard problem do you skip it and come back? Do you feel more time should be spent trying to figure it out because this has sort of made me lose some motivation as I didn't feel smart enough to understand how to get the answer.","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

However, the deeper one dives into the ecosystems, the less likely, one will find a good approach to testing the exact combination of libraries that one uses. I feel like if I wanted to do this well, I might end up writing more code for a testing scaffold than is in the entire library.

In this case, I am specifically looking for a nice and easy-to-use approach to testing entire routines that all fit the same saga (which makes sure that all routine stages are dispatched). Any suggestions?","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

"This is kind of a weird question but I'm working on a presentation for one of my classes, and for one of my demos I'd like to show how for instance a Rectangle would look on different resolutions (4:3, 5:4, etc..)/screen sizes (1920x1080, 1600x900, 2560x1440, etc..). 

I know I could probably go into Photoshop and stretch an image of a rectangle and get results but since all my other examples/demos are all within a canvas project using react-konva it would be a lot better if I could just set up some buttons that perform the stretching/sizing for a range of resolutions. 

The main issue I have is I'm lost on how to do the stretching of a shape to simulate how it would look on those various screen resolutions.

"I am trying to familarise myself with JS asynchronous mode and coding style.  
Say if I simply want to print out files in a directory, in a traditional language it is something like:

```
//Java no script
import java.io.*;

class Example {
  public function printFiles() {
    String dirPath = ""C:/Users/deanstreetlab/Downloads""; 
    File dir = new File(dirPath);
    File[] files = dir.listFiles(); //get array of file paths
    for (File f : files) {
      System.out.println(f.getName()); //print name of each file
  }
}

//using it to print files
Example ex = new Example();
ex.printFiles(); //printing file names
```

Using `fs.readdir` in the Node's `fs` library, a direct conversion of above will return `undefined` as the function will return long before `fs.readdir` returns file names.

In JS, I do the following to get out of callback hell:

```
const fs = require('fs'); //import nodejs fs library

function printFiles(callback) {
  let dirPath = ""C:/Users/deanstreetlab/Downloads"";
  fs.readdir(
    dirPath,
    function(err, files) {
      if (err) {
        callback(err);
       return;
      }
      callback(null, files);
    }
  );
}

function callmeback(err, files) {
  if (err){
    console.log(err.message);
    return;
  }
  files.forEach(f => console.log(f));
}

//using it to print files 
printFiles(callmeback); //printing file names

"**TL;DR In my debugger, when I hit a line that makes a call to an async function, and has a `then` method chained on the end, how do I step into the `then` method?  For example: `fetch('https://example.com/answer').then(data => {console.log(data)})`**

___

Hi all.  I'm relatively used to the Chrome debugger: stepping over lines of code, stepping into function, etc.  It's quite helpful in helping me figure out what my code is doing every step of the way. But one thing that trips me up is using it to debug asynchronous code.  

For example, let's say my code has an asynchronous function call (e.g. `fetch`), with a `then` call chained to the end (see below).  If I step through my code in the debugger I will reach the call to fetch.  But how can I then tell the debugger to wait for the response, then step into the `then` statement? If I use the debugger's 'step over' in the debugger, it simply skips the `then` statement, and puts me at the `fetch` closing bracket. If I use the debugger's 'step into' I step into the `fetch` function, which isn't what I want.

Thanks in advance.

"I'm working through The Odin Project's ""Factory Functions and The Module Pattern"" section, specifically the portion about Private variables and functions:

&#x200B;

I feel like I have a shaky, but mostly functional grasp on most of the *concepts* in this section, and I am able to create a factory function and (mostly) understand what is happening. My actual question will be clear in the context of the following code: 

&#x200B;

`const StringFactory = (string) => {`  
 `const capitalizeString = () => string.toUpperCase();`  
 `const printString = () => console.log(capitalizeString());`  
 `return { printString };`  
`};`  
`const taco = StringFactory(""taco"");`  
`taco.printString();`

&#x200B;

The return statement in the StringFactory function returns the printString function within an object. If it is not wrapped in braces the taco.printString() call throws a `TypeError: taco.printString is not a function.` So my question is this: 

why is it necessary in this case to return an object containing the function, as opposed to simply returning the reference to the printString function? 

&#x200B;

I hope the question I'm asking makes sense. Please let me know if you'll need any more information or context.

"I have read some [blogs](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-event-loop) and still don't quite get how can JS be asynchronous in a single-thread.  

Please explain like I am a retarded baby. My messy and inaccurate idea is something like below: 

JS as a language is synchronous (one stack, one heap) and its asynchronous-ness is provided by the engine (V8) in the environment (browser, nodejs). The engine (V8) interprets the codes and converts some blocking IO codes to nonblocking by taking them away from the callstack. The functions that get taken off stack are defined by the engine (Web APIs blah blah) and they get assigned to its *event loop* thingy.  

The engine will always monitor the callstack to check its activities. As soon as the stack isn't executing, the *event loop* will remove a pending (async) task and add it there to be executed.  

Hence, instead of true asynchronous (parallel) executions, it is actually deferred/delayed/rescheduled executions, but as long as the callstack isn't badly blocked, it feels like asynchronous to the programmer. The programmer can code without minding the messy threading stuff and the engine shuffles tasks to keep the stack always busy. That is why Nodejs shines when running many trivial and not-long tasks, but unsuitable when involve heavy computations (which block the stack).","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

"Hi!

I am working in a personal Front-End project for study purposes where I am trying to import functions from different JS files to be used in the app class. The problem is that when I set the main script to be used as module in HTML: <script>type=""module"", the same seems to not be executed. If I try to inspect the page, the app.js file does not show up in browser Sources. Do you have any clue about what is wrong? 

If I remove type=""module"" from the respective HTML file, the JS source codes show up in the browser inspection, but with error ""cannot use import statement outside a module"", which is obviously related to the lack of a module type in script.

Additional information: 

\- Each JS file is build as a class, since I am trying to create this project as most OOO as possible.

\- The only settings related to this error were the following:

\* Set type = module in HTML for the respective script.

\* export {functions} in module classes.

\* import {functions} in app/main class.

Please let me know if any additional information is required for this, thanks!

EDIT: I actually could solve it after a different search method came to my mind: 
It seems like the module function handles the variable scope in a different way, so I have changed the onclick() function inside the HTML index file to a event listener in the app JS file directly to avoid this scope issue. After that, just exported the whole module classes (export class xxx) and imported them in the app.js to use the respective functions.

"Hi,

I'm wondering if someone can show me a really data-agnostic/ abstract way to implement multiple complex filters on an array.

Say I got an array of objects.

`eg. const array = [{ name: 'Joe', dateOfBirth: '01/01/2000', occupation: 'carpenter', available: false, seeking: ['job', 'collaboration']},{ name: 'Jenny', dateOfBirth: '01/02/2000', occupation: 'lawyer', available: true, seeking: ['job', 'meeting people']}]`

And an array of filters.

`eg. const filters = [ { label: 'Occupation, options: [ 'carpenter', 'lawyer', 'doctor'] },{ label: 'Availability', options: [true, false] },{ label: 'Seeking', options: ['Job', 'Collaboration', 'Meeting people', 'All'] }]`

Filters can look different, this is just a model I was thinking would work. If they can be even more flexible that's great.

I want to:

1. Sort them according to certain criteria (have separate functions for sorting if that's easier, A-Z, Z-A, date of birth etc.)
2. Have multiple select inputs where I choose filters
3. Filter the results using .filter when I map through the array

I found several specific solutions but wondering if someone can make it as general as possible.

"Hi all,

I have a simple vanilla JS question: 

Given an element `a=document.createElement(""div"")`,

why does this work as expected ( produces `<div style=""width: 12px;"">`)

    a.style.width=""12px""

but this doesn't ( produces `<div style="""">`)

    a.style={width:""12px""}

From what I can see, it probably has to do with the fact that in the first case, `a.style` is a CSS2Properties object, whereas in the second case it's just a normal object.

That's why I also tried

    a.style={...a.style,width:""12px""} 

but again resulted in `<div style="""">`

Is there any way to get the second kind of syntax to work?","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"
"Hi, I'm currently doing the Basic Algorithm Scripting part in the JS course and I've found this exercise:

>Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.  
>  
>For example, \[""hello"", ""Hello""\], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.  
>  
>The arguments \[""hello"", ""hey""\] should return false because the string hello does not contain a y.  
>  
>Lastly, \[""Alien"", ""line""\], should return true because all of the letters in line are present in Alien.

After a few days trying to solve this, I gave up and went to the solve page. But I can't understand why the solution they give is any different to my solution. This is the code snippet that they give:

    function mutation(arr) {
      let test = arr[1].toLowerCase();
      let target = arr[0].toLowerCase();
      for (let i = 0; i < test.length; i++) {
        if (target.indexOf(test[i]) < 0) return false;
      }
      return true;
    }

And this is my solution, using ES6 syntax:

    function mutation(arr) {
      let test = arr[1].toLowerCase();
      let target = arr[0].toLowerCase();
      
      for (let x of test) {
        return target.indexOf(x) < 0 ? false : true;
      }
    }
    
    mutation([""hello"", ""hey""]);

I understand that these must be somewhat different since the code snippet they give seems to work and mine doesn't. I just can't see how, and why, and I would really appreciate if any could explain. Thanks.

"Hey guys lately I have been diving into JS and learning more and more. From different sources and looking at different codebases. However I have become overwhelmed with the weird realization that there is no one way to do things, which sort of gives me anxiety. I was learning about element.addEventListener for click events and I realized that for me it is much simpler and fluent to just add onclick=""event"" into my html button element. This is just one example of many.

Upon further studies I realized how many different tutorials and codepens can have the same essential app/ end product, but completely different codebase and way of getting there.

However at the end of the day, they all do the samething.

My question to you is, how do I know if I am doing things the most simplified or proper way? For context, I could have probably paraphrased this entire post and in essence my question would be the same if that makes sense. So I am trying to achieve this in JS. It is driving me crazy not knowing if I am doing things the simplest and most efficient way and knowing there are several ways to essentially achieve the same thing.

"Hello

I have a React frontend project that interacts with a SB API, in this case, it fetches a list of users from the backend.

JSON RESPONSE:

 \[{""id"":1,""username"":""ss"",""password"":""$2a$10$kDNPmKsXxDY4Qf4ve3VyBOTG.wXUv4d/0adKQqipdx0xG1Na8wh66"",""name"":""Sam"",""email"":null,""location"":""Ss"",""bio"":""adadada"", userStats"":\[{""userStatsId"":1,""victories"":0,""draws"":0,""defeats"":0},{""userStatsId"":2,""victories"":0,""draws"":0,""defeats"":0}\], ""totalGamesPlayed"":0}\]

How can I in React render the information from the first object like 'username' and 'location' alongside the information from the third object, UserStats, contained within the second object (List of UserStats)?

I currently have:

    const userList = users.map(user => {
    return <tr key={user.id}>
    <td style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}} class=""player-list-key-text"">{user.name}</td>
    <td class=""player-list-key-text"">{user.username}</td>
    <td class=""player-list-key-text"">{user.location}</td>
    </tr>
    });

And that works for those fields but I don't know how to access the List object and then the UserStats object's values? 

I'd like to also show the victories, draws and defeats.

"So I've solved this kata but it fails the tests because it is not fast enough. As I'm a total beginner, I come here for some help.

This is the kata:

>In this Kata, you will be given a number n (where n >= 1) and your task is to find n consecutive odd numbers whose sum is exactly the cube of n. Mathematically:cube = n \*\* 3sum = a1 + a2 + a3 + ..... + ansum == cubea2 == a1 + 2, a3 == a2 + 2, .......

For example:

    findSummands(3) = [7,9,11] // because 7 + 9 + 11 = 27

    function findSummands(n) {
    
    
      if (n == 1) return [1];
      if (n == 2) return [1, 3];

The thing is, how do we transform this html file dependencies to js comands that create the file on the fly, so that we can only use JS comands to create a webpage?

Its that feasible, to only use JavaScript Console input code to generate all the necessary html and css code for everthing to work with the intended JS comands, and any other?

I really struggled with the JavaScript modules in the beginning, to the point where I’ve now basically dedicated my education time to getting better at it. That being said, I paid for the course and I want to finish it. I’m at the point now where we are going through databases (SQL/NOSQL etc) and I’m just really having a hard time seeing the relevance of it all if I wanted to focus primarily on be a “JavaScript developer”. 

   My question is, as a Junior, would you say that I need to have at least a basic understanding of say MongoDB, or do I need to know the ins and outs of it? Do I need to know how to build servers and use databases and be entry level “full stack” to get a job as a Junior?

There aren't really hints, only the ""solution"" option which I feel like is cheating to click. These questions are considered ""easy"" apparently, according to the intro program. Is it common to feel stuck after coming out of the learning phase and going into applying knowledge?

I don't really know what is the best way to progress with solving these problems. Is it really cheating to look at the solution and work backwards? Should I relearn the basics again? Should I go do something else like different challenges on code wars or something? I have one month before I need to apply and I worried about doing the wrong things.

    Object.keys(methods).forEach(key => {
        this['__proto__'][key] = (...args) => methods[key](...args);

"Pretty much my entire life I've been writing util functions like

    function utilFunc(obj, shouldDoSomething) {}    

As the code base grows bigger, oftentimes you come across lines like

    utilFunctions.utilFunc(dataObject, false);

without any concept of what the boolean parameters do until actually jumping into the function itself. I know this is pretty prevalent in Java, but not sure about JS. 

A better way would be to write it as

"Hi,  


I spent lots of time reading about JS variables and the differences between let, const, var etc. but I'm still a bit confused.

I'm creating a course platform and each lesson page has the following declarations:

        let normalWaveform = '<%= @normal_waveform %>';
        let slowWaveform = '<%= @slow_waveform %>';
        let practiceWaveform = '<%= @practice_waveform %>';
        let normalAudio = '<%= @normal_audio %>';
        let slowAudio = '<%= @slow_audio %>';
        let practiceAudio = '<%= @practice_audio %>';
        let normalAudioWebm = '<%= @normal_audio_webm %>';
        let slowAudioWebm = '<%= @slow_audio_webm %>';
        let practiceAudioWebm = '<%= @practice_audio_webm %>';

Each variable is equal to the file URL given by Ruby on Rails. 

This works great when a user loads a first lesson but I get the following error when a user loads a second lesson in the same session:

    Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of let normalWaveform

This makes sense since the variable has already been declared in the previous lesson.

What I'm not sure of is how to make sure the variable is declared if it hasn't been declared and reassigned otherwise. 

I know using var would work but I heard it's not a very good practice. Same for not using anything at all and just writing waveform = directly.

So I'm wondering: what's the best way of dealing with this situation?

"I'm scraping data from an online database to create an API for a sport I follow. I'm scraping the data then I'm storing it into a MongoDB cloud data store and finally then I will make a graphQL API to access the data on my front end.

I have data for athletes that I'm thinking to break down into at least three parts

1. athlete data (things like their height and weight etc)
2. stats (a more in-depth stat object with sport-specific metrics)
3. match data (data about each of their matches)

My question is for stats should I keep this stats object (an array of about 10 string key-value pairs.) within the larger athlete object or should I set up a separate collection and store it there while storing a secondary key within my athlete collection.

The same question applies for match data but is a little more clear that Matches should be broken down into their own collection.

I've never created a graphQL API before so I'm not sure how this will affect things.

Essentially if I store them in separate collections this (I think) would require more database reads to access the same data but will give me more modularity. Because I expect this data to be consumed through a GraphQL API also perhaps storing it all into one ugly object isn't so bad because this will get broken down later anyway?

"This is bothering me since quite some time.

Let's say i have a variable and i want to perform some action to transform it.

    const myVar = ""myString""

There are atleast 3 possible patterns.

My teammates often do this:

    let myVar = ""myString""
    myVar = transform(myVar)

This has the advantage that you don't have to come up with a different name for the variable. But i don't like this style, as i don't like to perform unnecessary reassignments. I like more functional approaches, like this:

    const myTransformWrapper = (myParam) => transform(myParam)
    const myVar = myTransformWrapper(""myString"")

This has the following pros:

* No reassignments
* No coming up with another variable name
* The function actually helps to better document the code, it clarifies your intents.

But the obvious problem here is that we are adding a new function, sometimes for very little code abstraction.

Then  of course there is the simplest approach:

    const myVar = ""myString""
    const myTransformedVar = transform(myVar)

The problem with this is that we have to come up with a name for the old variable and a name for the new variable that makes sense. For small transformations, sometimes it can be hard to come up with meaningful names that well express our intentions. Like, it still is the same item as before we just needed to perform some trivial transformation on it.

"I currently use namespaces for my JS files after reading through some best practices for custom D365 CRM code.

However, I recently ran across a post that mentioned that modules, not namespaces, are now the preferred way of packaging code. Looking into this, I'm confused about a few things:

* If the goal is to decrease load time, don't all the libraries included on a form get downloaded regardless? So packaging code into separate modules wouldn't improve load time, correct?
* If the goal is to decrease or manage dependencies, don't all libraries get loaded before the UI loads, so that wouldn't be a concern?
* Would a ""helper file"" with a namespace work just as well or the same as exporting/importing modules?

In my boot camp we're currently learning about running times

&#x200B;

**We have this example:** 

    let result = 0; 
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { 
    let number = array[i];   
    result += number; }  
    console.log(result);

**The course broke it down like such:**

    let result = 0; // 1 
    for ( let i = 0; // 1   
    i < array.length; // n + 1   
    i++ // n 
    ) { 
    let number = array[i]; // n   
    result += number; // n }  
    console.log(result); // 1

Q: What is the running time if you were to add them together?

A: >!If we add them all together, we can get the running time of the entire algorithm 3 + (n \* 3) + n + 1 which can be simplified to 4 + (n \* 4). A more conventional way to write this math expression is 4n + 4.!<

I don't understand why certain lines of code are ""1"",  ""n"", or ""n + 1"". Can anyone kindly explain this further? I would ask my instructors, but it's currently the holiday season, and they're on break. 

I'm really struggling with this, and so an ELI5 would be really appreciated.

Thanks for any help!","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

"Hi everyone! I'm writing a plugin for a framework - [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/write-a-plugin) \- and the functionality of my code works.

However, I am now testing edge cases to make sure it works for all instances that I can think of, without crashing the page load.

At the moment I'm searching for the beginning of the markdown file for a specific phrase and then using that to verify whether the script should continue:

    function myplugin(hook, vm) {
     let go = false;
    
     hook.beforeEach((content) => {
      if (content.startsWith('@myplugin')) {

"I'm using webpack 5 for a project, and I'm having a problem where the app works fine if I go to the root, but if I go to a subpath it tries to serve main.js from that subpath and can't find it.

It looks like webpack is adding this to the head of the rendered html, but it needs to have the fully qualified path:

Here's the problem:

    localhost:8080/someRoute/1 // doesn't work - serves main from localhost:8080/someRoute/main.js

How do I configure this? I went into my html and added an additional script tag to force it to use a fully qualified path, but webpack still injects the relative path and throws an error when it can't find it.

From there we can perhaps clean up any 3rd party scripts by removing all that are unnecessary and substituting them with lighter ones when we can.

"This magic eye video viewer I made years ago worked fine in Chrome and Firefox..... recently I tried it again, and in Chrome many of the buttons don't work anymore.

While the magic-eye is playing, pressing ""Reveal video"" is supposed to stop the magic-eye random dots from appearing, and change the video output to the source depth video (the greyscale animated depth maps).

I honestly can't imagine what's going on here. I never waste as much time on something so simple as with JavaScript. The browser is Chrome so it should be working.

I'm just trying to filter out some select options if their value contains a string input by the user.

HTML:

    <input id=""PlaceInput"" />
    
    <button id=""PlaceButton"" type=""button"">Search</button>
    
    <select id=""PlaceSelect"">
        <option value=""Somewhere"">Somewhere</option>

    function SetHidden(element, key) {
        if (element.value.includes(key)) {
            element.hidden = false;

        const select = document.getElementById(""PlaceSelect"");
    
        select.childNodes.forEach(element => SetHidden(element, key));
    }

I've tried many variations, .toString() on the values, or .innerText instead of values. Those seem to yield the desired string but won't work properly when combined with the ""includes"" method. ""Includes"" works fine with manually typed out strings. I keep getting the same error:

Hi everyone,

I hope I'm posting in the right channel.

I've been a developer for a few years now. I know JavaScript and how to code, but I do feel I sometimes have difficulties on resolving bugs or reading big projects.

I just started a new job in Vue JS (that I have very few knowledge on) and it's a big web app. I sometimes feel like I go barking at the wrong tree when trying to resolve a bug. For example, today I realized that some data was not passed in another component and I immediatly tried to understand how the data was passed when actually, the problem just came from a function (that didn't return the needed data). I spent half a day on this and I feel quite stupid... I also sometimes forget to check the network tab in DevTools and other such things which seems natural with my colleagues (who have more experience than me)...

I know part of this will come with other years of development but I'd really like to up my game for this new job and improve as a developer in general. Do you know of any webiste/tutorial/Youtube or Twitch channel that shows you how ""to think"", or some reflexes to have when debugging, or how to read code in big web projects ? (I find myself quite confused when in a project some developers write in ES5, others ES6, or Vue JS 2 and Vue JS 3 and not being sure of the equivalent of each...)

Any help, or tip, is much appreciated ! =)","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"

* cell F2 contains ""Sell 1 @ $20""

        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;

your task is to create a method called `paths()` that returns an array of arrays of strings representing each sequence of values encountered when going from the top of the tree to one of its leaves. A leaf is any tree that has no children. Examples:

    const tree1 = new Tree(""a"");
    console.log(tree1.paths()); // [ [ ""a"" ] ]

    const tree2 = new Tree(""a"", {
      left: new Tree(""b1"", {

        enumerable: true,

My understanding is that hackers could overwrite the prototype methods which would wreck havoc on servers. So if I were to use this code to prevent method rewrites and descriptor rewrites would there be any possibility for Prototype Pollution attack?

"EDIT BELOW

I created an array consisting of foods, for example 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'cherry' etc. Now I need something to randomly select 3 elements from this array, without selecting the same thing twice (for example not 'orange' 'orange' 'banana'). I have searched for a solution myself, but I'm fairly new to coding and don't really understand everything. Can someone help me a little bit?

    const randomSelectionH = (n) => {

        return healthy_foods;

        let newElem = healthy_foods[Math.floor(Math.random() * healthy_foods.length)];

          newElem = healthy_foods[Math.floor(Math.random() * healthy_foods.length)];
        }
        newArr.push(newElem);
      }
      return newArr;

`var colours = ['#F2626A', '#FEBA4F', '#FFEA56', '#8FE968', '#36CEDC', '#C381FD', '#FF90E9'];
var currentColour = +(localStorage.previousBGColour || -1)+1;
currentColour = currentColour >= colours.length ? 0 : currentColour;//if index is not set reset to colour at index 0
document.getElementById('chameleon').style.backgroundColor = colours[currentColour];
localStorage.previousBGColour =  currentColour;//store colour that's currently in use`

I think its because of safari's elastic scroll but i want to fix this issue. here's the code.

    var prevScrollpos = window.pageYOffset;
    window.onscroll = function() {
      var currentScrollPos = window.pageYOffset;
      if (prevScrollpos > currentScrollPos) {
        document.getElementById(""navbar"").style.top = ""0"";
      } else {
        document.getElementById(""navbar"").style.top = ""-50px"";
      }
      prevScrollpos = currentScrollPos;
    } 

Kindly help me out as this has been disturbing me for hours.","LearnJavaScript,javascript,js,es6,programming"
"I have a very small project (index.html, styles.css, main.js, squares.json) and I'd like to take some static objects from my .json file and use them in my main.js script.  

My json is structure roughly like so:

    [
        {
            ""name"" : ""name1"",
            ""type"" : ""type1"",
            ""desc"" : ""desc1"",
            ""rule"" : ""rule1""
        },
        {
            ""name"" : ""name2"",
            ""type"" : ""type2"",
            ""desc"" : ""desc2"",
            ""rule"" : ""rule2""
        }
    ]

And I'd like to assign that info to a variable in my main script so that I can access it like an array of objects as if I defined this array directly in my main.js file.  I don't need to overwrite the .json file at all, just read from it once to assign it to a variable.  I am not using node or anything besides just html/css/js-- for use in browser.

I currently have:

    let squares;
    fetch('./squares.json')
    .then(response=>{
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
        squares = data;
    });

    console.log(squares)

Which tells me `squares` is undefined.  Though I can use the browser console `>> squares` and get returned the array I want...

"Hi! So I'm kinda new to everything and I'm struggling with something. I'm trying to add a pop-up when I hit submit on a form but I get ""getElementById(...) is null"" even though there's no mistake Id wise (it even works when I close the error page and try it). I think it's because it tries to load before the Id is read so I tried a few solutions I saw for ppl who had the same problem and it does get rid of the error but then my pop-up doesn't work... I even tried to put it directly in the html (I have to put it in a .js for this work) and same as before: no error but won't work. Any idea? Here's what I wrote :

    const message = ""blablabla""
    document.getElementById(""contactForm"").addEventListener(""submit"", function(event){
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(message);
    });

"Hi everyone.

So I was initializing a Sanity CMS project for the organization I work at. However, whenever I run sanity initit creates the project in my personal Sanity account.

I looked into the docs but I can't find any way to specify the organization I want to create the project in. If anyone of you have a answer, please let me know.

"I am very new to java/writing code. But I have managed to build a chrome extension that is currently working as intended for me. 

I have a popup window that I can enter information, I am storing this information with chrome.storage.sync.

I would like to publish this and share it with my colleagues, and for us all to be able to contribute and have access to the same stored data via the extension.

My understanding is that chrome.storage.sync is personal to each Google account, is that correct?
How should the data be stored to allow all users to contribute/access it?

"I'm planning to have a full `vh-100` section for each part e.g. ""Me, Projects, Education..."".

My question is what is the best way to lay this out in Bootstrap 5? Should I do one container with multiple rows, where each row is `h-100`? Multiple containers, each `h-100` for each section? Does it make a difference?

Also when I was looking at the layout created by `create-react-app`, the HTML goes:

    <body>
