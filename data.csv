Merry Christmas everyone! Welcome to your weekly thread where you can share your gym tales!,fitness
"Hello! 

As mentioned, this is my first post here, so I’ll just jump right in to it and explain.

I (male, 20’s) do a lot of different activities (mostly running, cycling, skating on ice, crossfit. High intensity is Key), but recently i’ve lost interest in doing these kind of activities alone. In fact, I think its straight up boring just having to do these things by myself. I want to share my training experience with somebody, talk about the training session, and so on. 
Its just about having someone interested in the same kind of things as me. If i want to do a hike in the mountains, i usually have to prepare myself that its just going to be me.

I have a girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to be involved in these high intensity training sessions. With her, i usually just walk. I also have some friends that I ask if want to join me, but they never want to.

I’m not even an extreme kind of training guy, i’m just average and want to be in physical activity. When I first started training, i didn’t care about being alone. But Now i think about training as some kind of experience, rather than some kind of personal goal. 

I dont how to solve this. 

QUESTIONS: Do any of you struggle with the same?How do you manage to exercise alone? 

I’d love to have your take on this.",fitness
"Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. ""Non-negotiable"" as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn't possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip. What am I missing?",fitness

"#[Link to Article](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/what-is-the-best-method-of-cardio-for-fat-burning/)

In this blog post from Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, he summarizes a recent meta-analysis his team performed comparing HIIT and moderate intensity exercise on fat loss:

[Slow and Steady, or Hard and Fast? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Comparing Body Composition Changes between Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/11/155/htm)

He notes a previous meta-analysis came to a different conclusion but has since been retracted after several oddities were found.  (Which, as an aside, [seems to be a thing](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/17/exercise-researcher-earns-more-retractions-as-investigations-mount/) plaguing Brazilian research lately.)  

The new paper is open source and worth a read, but Brad sums it up nicely by saying:

>Take-home: We can confidently state that HIIT cannot be considered a “magic bullet” for fat loss; MICT is equally as effective for achieving this outcome.

Still, the data is not without its limitations and Brad does a good job laying those out and further explaining how different protocols may lead to different results.  Then concluding with a message I don't think can be repeated enough:

>Research can help to guide exercise prescription, but ultimately you must determine the best course of action based on individual needs, abilities, and goals.",fitness

"Hi guys,

Its been a while since my last post and I thought I'd just share where I am at with lifting and give an update now that I am 6-7 years into constently training (I think my last post was at 4 years into training for reference). 

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and after photo 01](https://i.imgur.com/4TrLyBH.jpg)

[Before and after photo showing legs lol 02](https://i.imgur.com/qKAbFPh.jpeg)

**WEIGHT:**

154lb (70KG) to 169lb (76.8KG) in the photos

169lb is me probably at my leanest. Usually if I am not dieting, I sit closer to 83kg/183lb. 

Timeframe is approximately 6+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. The last two years have been a bit rougher with less time in the gym and more time dedicated to other things. Progress has definitely slowed down and training volume has decreased but still a consistent part of my life. 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 193lb (88kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

**PROGRAM**

As previously mentioned, training volume has dramatically decreased due to time constraints and life getting in the way now that I am older. I'd like to think that I am smarter with training these days and instead push each set a lot harder than I used to and make more use of it but I definitely still waste a lot of time fluffing around or chatting with friends at the gym. I am still running a Push Pull Leg Split although most weeks I will skip the second leg day for a extra rest day. I'd like to attribute this to the fact that squats have not felt great since having my ankle run over by a car when skating however I think I am just too lazy to work on the mobility etc needed to get my squat back up lol.

**Monday - Push 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x8-12 Flat Bench
* 4x8-12 Incline Dumbbell Bench
* 4x12-20 lateral raises
* 4x12-20 rear delt flies
* Tricep accessories vary

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

Example workout would be

* 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats
* 4x8-12 single arm dumbbell rows
* 4x8-12 Lat pull down
* 4x8-12 chest supported row
* Bicep accessories vary

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-8 squats
* 4x20 Walking Lunges
* 4x12 Leg Hamstring Curl
* 4x12 Leg Extension
* 4x12 Sissy Squats
* 4x12 Straight Leg/Romanian Deadlifts

**Thursday - Rest**

**Friday - Push 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-7 Overhead Press
* 4x12 Incline Barbell Press
* 4x12 Arnold/Shoulder press
* 4x12-20 Lateral Raises
* 4x12 Cable Flies Low to High and High to Low

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x4-8 Conventional Deadlifts
* 5x10 Pull ups (weighted)
* 4x8 Rowing movement
* 4x8 Lat pulldown
* Bicep accesories if there is time

**Sunday - Rest**

I still religiously do core every second day which consists of decline sit ups, dragon flags, hanging leg raises/windshield wipers.

As I mentioned, the last two years of training have not been ideal. Strength has not been a driving factor for training and I definitely could have made bigger improvements if I focused more. Unfortunately such is life and hobbies/passions cannot always be prioritized.

**COMEPETITION PREP**

Around July 2021, I decided that I needed some more motivation and that I was sick of going to the gym to just do the movements and make little to no progress. I approached my friend who competes in bodybuilding and decided that I would try my luck at a natural men's physique bodybuilding show set for mid November. 

Unfortunately one month into my competition prep my city went into Covid Lockdown and all gyms shut down (and are currently still closed). I was fortunate enough to act quickly and get a bunch of gym equipment to set up a home gym so my prep continued. However with covid spreading throughout the country, the shows looked less and less certain and the show I was intending to do has been postponed twice already. 

I decided that I would call off the competition prep three weeks ago as we are still in a lockdown and competition prep has been intruding on everyday life, work, and my relationship with my partner. 

See below photos for start of competition prep vs where I ended prep.

[Competition Prep Photos](https://i.imgur.com/clsIOMS.jpg)

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep vs everyday diet is very very different however I will list below what a typical day looked like on prep as it is a lot more structured. 

**Breakfast**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit

**Lunch**

200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

150g steamed brocolli and beans

**Pre-Gym**

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Dinner - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato

100g Steamed vege

Protein Shake

**Post Dinner**

200g Chicken breast

200g salad mix with balsamic vinegar dressing or something

Usually this adds up to about 2400-2600 calories depending on the day. 

When I wasn't on competition prep, things were a lot more flexible and I eat out a lot with my partner. I still meal prep weekly and make sure I eat about 60-70% of all my calories quite similar to the above competition prep diet. I generally eat between 3500-4000 calories to maintain a bodyweight of about 86kg/190lb. 

**END**

Thank you all for reading through all that lol and I also just want to thank this community for being so helpful when I first started lifting. I hope this post can help someone out there who is just starting/already into their journey. Feel free to send me a message or comment below with any questions and I will try my best to answer!

"Hello to all,

Here you can find the questions and a link that you will take you to the respective part in the YouTube video where the question is answered. I'm a big fan of the video series but I always found it a bit unfortunate that you can't just browse through a list to find the questions I find interesting.

"I'm looking for advice, ideas or experiences about strength training with one hand. Due to an injury several years ago I had my main wrist flexor tendon sheath (FCR) released surgically 3 years ago and I'm basically left with a painful right hand that flares up badly with tight gripping or flexion under load (push ups are bad news). Prior to the injury and surgery several years ago I lifted weights regularly for many years and loved it. I felt it kept me health mentally and physically. Since the injury I've lost about 30 lbs of muscle, most of my clothes are baggy now and I just dearly miss exercising. I've accepted where I'm at with the hand and I want to move forward with this new limitation. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to get back into strength training and am looking for any ideas at all; most/all of my old basic gym lifts are not doable anymore.

I have done some looking via Google and on this subreddit, but I haven't found anything very definitive.  Thus far I have been trying some body weight exercises (mostly one legged squats, unweighted lunges and core work), Pilates, some modified yoga/DPPY yoga (I made a roughly elbow height platform that I can rest my forearms on for downward dog etc). This has been better than nothing, but I really miss lifting weights (or body weight) and strength training. I realize I'm unlikely to put on large amount of muscle with one hand, but I'd really like to recover some of my lost muscle mass and/or get that great feeling you get after a hard workout. Has anyone done strength training one handed or know of anywhere that I might find more information? It doesn't have to be classic strength training. I'm very open to any type of exercise type or program, I just miss the feeling of being tired after a good workout. Getting stronger would be a huge bonus though.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all of the input and motivation. Super helpful. I'm going to try some of this and get back in the gym and just experiment.

&#x200B;

**In short**: I can't use my right hand/wrist for tight gripping or pushing and I'm trying to do some type of physically tiring exercise, ideally strength training, but I'm open to anything tiring, and I was hoping for and ideas or input.

Thanks!",fitness

"Hey all! For reference, I am a squash player. The length of the ""track"" is 10meters so every 10m i need to turn the sled around. So one ""round"" is 10m

I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. 

My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder.  If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. 

So my question is, do  you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. 

Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls? Like instead of pushing, you go backwards.


Tl;dr: how to program sled push

Edit 2: After reading the comments I will adding the sled push to build leg endurance and not speed. I will be cheking the sprint subreddit for that",fitness

"# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!

r/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.

"24 years male, 1,87m(6'1) went from 87,3kg(192,5 lbs) to 68,5kg(151lbs) in 6 months.

[Progress pic/TDEE estimate/Weight Loss Graph](https://imgur.com/a/i2K3eSO)

**Diet:**

Calories:

Setted the goal of losing 0,9% bodyweight per week, eated the calories that would cause this given the amount of exercise I was doing, check TDEE estimate to see calories and weight variation.

Macros:

Sticked to 2,2-2,8g/kg/day of protein cause of the satiety benefits instead of the 1,6-2,2 range.

For fats I stayed near 0,5g/kg/day and minimizing saturated fats, and the rest I completed with carbs and sometimes alcohol.

I weighted myself every morning right after waking up and using the bathroom, only supplements I took were creatine monohydrate and a big cup of coffe before workouts.

**Exercise:**

Routine:

I sticked with Push-Legs-Pull since I went to the gym 6 times a week. Chose my exercises based on the concept of SFR(stimulus to fatigue ratio) since those were my first 6 months in the gym the first 2 were more experimentation and seeing what worked best for me but from there I sticked with those:

PUSH:

1. CHEST PRESS
2. SHOULDER PRESS
3. INCLINE DUMBELL BENCH PRESS
4. MACHINE ASSISTED DIP
5. CABLE TRICEPS PUSHDOWN
6. HANGING LEG RAISES

LEGS:

1. LEG PRESS
2. DUMBELL STIFF LEG DEADLIFT
3. THIGH ABDUCTOR
4. SUMO SQUAT
5. LEG EXTENSION
6. CALF PRESS
7. AB CRUNCH MACHINE

PULL:

1. MACHINE ASSISTED PULL UP
2. SEATED MACHINE ROW
3. UPRIGHT ROW
4. BARBELL CURL
5. MACHINE BICEP CURL
6. TWISTING SIT UP

I did 2 Mesocycles with a deload in the middle of them (it's the green week on TDEE estimate) for sets and reps I started lightly at 2 sets each exercise and 3 Reps in reserve in first week of the meso and increased it to 5 sets each exercise and 0 Reps in reserve in the last week of the meso. At the first 3 days of the week I focused on progressing load and in the last 3 days of the week I focused progressing reps, that made me stay in the 8-12 rep range for the first 3 days and 10-20 rep range for the last 3 days.

This part was really auto regulated I didn't increase every exercise to 5 sets I just increased the volume enough to give me greats pumps, burn in high reps sets, tension in low rep sets and recovering fast enough to not be sore on the next day I trained that same muscle group and ofc started relatively light and made it unsustainably hard in the last week.

Alright, I imagine that all of the above are pretty usual things that most of folks probably do, now I also done two other things that I think helped me a lot!

First: I made use of 2 days Refeeds based on a study that saw greater muscle retention, I putted those on Thursday and Friday to get the beginning of high rep half of the week and since on Sunday I rested it made possible to increase volume while still being able to recover properly.

Second: Only cardio I did was taking steps, A LOT of steps. Steps are really inefficient from a time pov but when you factor the fatigue it generates its really small you can burn so much calories without hurting NEAT or training that is completely broken. I started by taking 10000 steps daily but ramped it up to 20000 steps near the end of the diet. You can check on TDEE that I was eating 2150kcal and still losing tons of weight in the end cause of the high volume training and high step count.

I read the following books to help me guide the methodology I used:

1. Art of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
2. Science of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
3. Fat Loss Forever - Layne Norton
4. The Pyramid of Muscle - Eric Helms
5. Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy - Brad Schoenfeld

Next on my list are the Renaissance Periodization books since Dr. Mike Israetel seems an amazing author.

Thanks for reading if you made it to here! My future plan now its to maintain and deload for the next 2 weeks and start a mass gaining phase at the rate of 0,5% bodyweight per week for 6 months while lifting heavy.",fitness

"So I'm a total beginner to fitness (especially weight lifting) and haven't even gone to a gym yet, but I'm thinking about my fitnessplan at the moment. I don't want to grow muscles on my upper body, but mostly on my legs and glutes. I would just like to train my back a little for a better posture, but I don't see any reason to train my arms. But then again I'm worried it would look weird if I have a visibly trained lower body but untouched arms. I would want to tighten the muscles in my arms at least but I heard tightening muscles is a myth and I also don't understand what you do differently when you want to tighten muscles in contrast to growing them. Especially if I have to be in a caloric surplus to grow muscles on my legs and glutes, then how can I simultaneously tighten them on different places and not grow them. It would only make sense to me to be in a caloric deficit if you want to tighten muscles. But I have no idea, so please correct me if I'm wrong....",fitness

"Hey guys!

I came across a really interesting article and I am wondering if someone has done this type of training before, or what some people's thoughts are. 


To try to condense the article, it suggests using different weights to create uneven loads. It gives this example. ""When selecting your weights for off-balance weight training, start by making sure the heavier side has 5 to 10 pounds less than normal for unsupported movements (meaning not laying on the ground or on a bench). Then subtract another 5 to 10 pounds for the other side. For example, if your Walking Dumbbell Lunge is normally performed with 40-pound dumbbells in each hand, I’d start with a 30-pound dumbbell in one hand and a 20 or 25-pound dumbbell in the other hand. Then, and this is crucial, you want to make sure you perform an equal number of reps with the dumbbells swapped. So if you start with the heavier dumbbell in your right hand and the lighter dumbbell in your left hand, you need to ensure you’re performing an equal number of reps with the heavier dumbbell in your left hand and the lighter dumbbell in your right hand"". 

The justification for this type of training is that in the real world we dont deal with perfectly balanced weights, so training this way helps us in a more practical sense. It also discusses stabilizing muscles. 

Anyways, I'm interested in playing around with this type of training, but just wanted to see if someone has done this before and/or what are some people's thoughts. 

Here is a link to the article if you're curious. 
https://www.stack.com/a/build-a-more-athletic-brand-of-strength-with-uneven-load-weight-training/",fitness
"Was doing wall sits and was just shocked how a max hold can smoke the quads harder than multiple reps of squats can. I started thinking about how doing negatives and static holds helped me achieve 10+ pull-ups when I previously couldn’t do a single rep.


How exactly do static exercises build muscle? I understand it’s time under tension. Old school ideology is high reps = muscle building, low reps = strength. I know that doesn’t exactly translate today, as strength builds muscle and endurance builds strength, but it still holds true to some extent.


So in theory, is a wall sit more akin to doing high rep leg press(or some other quad isolation). Or is it more like doing one max strength rep? Could someone technically do nothing but wall sits and build massive quads?

EDIT: lots of downvotes on this. I wasn’t suggesting this is as a substitution or even a thought about incorporating them into my workout. It was purely just a passing curiosity about the mechanism of action.",fitness

"Hi Everybody!

Today I want to showcase a physical training app that is available for both [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boostcamp-training-programs/id1529354455) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmhealth.boostcamp&hl=en_US&gl=US).

[Boostcamp.](https://www.boostcamp.app/)

First, I’ll tell you why this app has impressed me. They’re one of two developers to have contacted me and asked me about my programs before releasing them on their app. Because I have published many free training programs, there are many free options out there for apps that include them. However, not all are created equally – which is why I am impressed with Boostcamp.

In chatting with the development team, I have helped them add a GZCLP progression to Boostcamp, which has notable lifters like Greg Nuckols and Jonnie Candito on the team.

Boostcamp has many programs available, including: nSuns 5/3/1, Nuckols’ Beginner Program, PHUL, Reddit PPL, and Candito’s 6 Week, and quite a few others.

I am stoked that GZCLP has been added to their app. Even more so that the app does a good job of adding flexibility and many options to personalized GZCLP to suit your needs.

This means that when you run GZCLP on Boostcamp you will be able to:

Determine your training days by days of the week. This is also displayed in a neat calendar view that shows what days you trained on, providing easy review of your own training history. (Currently 4-days per week is supported in the beta, a 3-day schedule is in the works.)

Units and weight rounding. Supports both Freedom Units and Kilograms and allows for rounding to the smallest weight plate available. So if you have access to 1.25 lbs. micro plates, then go for it.

Update weights and reps. Meaning if you’ve made a bigger increase in weight than called for, perhaps because last week you noticed it was too easy, you can make that change on the fly.

Same goes for your reps. Last set rep outs (+ sets) are accounted for. This is a major function of how GZCLP progresses, so to have this be straightforward and easily tracked is huge.

Additional exercises can be added. Say you want to do more pressing on Day 2, you can add that – or another variety – using a convenient drop-down list. This is for your T2 and T3 exercises.

After completing a week of workouts, the app populates the next week for you.

After a workout you can provide a rating and feedback, noting what went right, wrong, or otherwise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Boostcamp also provides community support! There’s a chatroom for the individual program where you can help others also running the program and get help from those same people.

Additionally, should you want to support the program creator, such as yours truly (or perhaps Greg Nuckols, or Jonnie Candito), you can! I am thankful for every donation I get from you all via PayPal, which is linked in my blog, but that Boostcamp provides this option for those content creators is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, it is important simply for recognizing the work of those that created the training programs, who without the app would not be as good!

Please check out Boostcamp, especially if you’re running a 4-day version of GZCLP. I am sure it will help you streamline your progress and make easier the tracking of your training history.

Have a fantastic day,

Cody (GZCL)",fitness

[End Physique](https://imgur.com/a/8NhJXWa)

Now that I hopefully have earned a bit of your attention here is a rough breakdown of what you are getting into:

**Definitions and Concepts**: It’s not exciting but I want to start off by introducing my specific definitions for some terminology, as well as some overarching ideas that form the framework of what I am presenting. I hope that by covering this from the outset the whole post will make more sense and we can avoid silly arguments based on semantic differences and misunderstandings 

**Why you should pursue Strength Goals while Cutting**: This section will go into why I think that you should entertain the notion that cutting does not need to be a period of stagnation, and why you should be pushing for strength goals during this period rather than in periods of weight gain/bulking. 

**How to Structure Training under this Philosophy**: This section will cover some ideas on how to apply the ideas presented in the former section when building your long term training regimens. 

**A Detailed Look at my recent Cut**: Finally I will go into details on what I did on my most recent cut to give an example of the suggestions discussed in the previous section in action. 

Finally I want to add a note here before we start on who is an appropriate audience for this post. This information is ultimately aimed at more advanced lifters. This does not mean that I think the information contained is worthless for beginners or intermediates, but realize that some conditions and assumptions will not apply fully or at all to you. I encourage you to think about the ideas I present, either to pull select parts for your own use or just as something to stick in the back of your mind for when you are lifting at a higher level. This post is also aimed at general lifters who want the best of all worlds when it comes to strength, size, etc. If you are competing in a specific sport and what to dive fully into the aspects you compete in this might not fully apply to you. With that aside let’s start.
_____________________________________________________________________

**DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS**:

The first thing we need to get out of the way is what a cut is and what a bulk is in this context, and what the goals of each are.

 I am assuming here that a cut is a period of caloric deficit in which you are trying to maintain muscle mass while losing fat to a reasonable level. You are not trying to gain mass in any way while cutting, and you are not cutting to obscenely low body fat percentage. I won’t put a firm number on obscenely low but if you are trying to prep for bodybuilding competition or reach a similar level of leanness that is not a cut *in the context of this post*. 

I am assuming here that a bulk is a period of caloric surplus in which you are trying to build muscle mass. The amount of fat you do or do not gain is not really relevant, but I would expect you are gaining *some*. I want to reiterate that this is the only inherent goal of a bulk here, gaining mass, particularly muscle. No other goals that might be associated with bulks are relevant here. 


Next I want to distinguish the big difference between *gaining/building strength* and *demonstrating/showing strength*. In the simplest terms, building strength refers to developing your strength potential, and showing strength refers to demonstrating your strength potential. It is really easy to blend these together as they share the same name and are interconnected but I will try hard to distinguish them when writing this. 

When I refer to gaining strength, or strength potential, I am referring generally to the force production potential of your muscles and any other long term adaptations relevant to the lifts you care about. I encourage you to think of this as a static value, 100% of which would represent the most you could lift under ideal circumstances. 


When I refer to demonstrating strength I am referring generally to what you can actually lift on any given rep, once all the factors the influence that rep have been accounted for. Think of this as a percentile system based on your strength potential. On any given day you might be able to ‘show’ 84% of your potential. In this case if your potential was a 100lb lift you would be able to manage an 84lb lift *for that one specific rep*. 

Another important term along these lines is Strength Specificity, this is simply how well you can apply your muscles force production potential to perform a specific movement. Things like technical improvement, mental focus, etc improve your strength specificity in a given movement.  

_____________________________________________________________________

**WHY YOU SHOULD PERSUE STRENGTH GOALS WHILE CUTTING**

Now that the boring part is out of the way, let’s get into the meat of this post. The idea that I am presenting is that you should structure your training with the goal of reaching new strength related PRs while cutting, and not while bulking. To illustrate why I think training should be done this way I will present a few arguments/points. 

First off let’s look at what you need from your training during cuts and bulks to successfully reach the goal of the period, maintaining muscle mass and building muscle mass respectively: 

**The volume/overall stimulation needed to maintain muscle is much lower then it is to build new muscle.** This is a lesson I think a lot of new lifters, and some not so new lifters, need to learn and really internalize. Many people seem to have the notion that you need to fight *harder* to keep muscle when cutting than you do to gain muscle when bulking. This just is not accurate. To draw from personal experience I used to train similarly when cutting and bulking in terms of volume. This made cutting harder, and rather unpleasant. Then I ended up cutting through quarantine in the beginnings of my home gym, with only the basics (rack, power bar, bench, lightish DBs and pullup bar). The lack of options ended up with my cutting a good deal of the extra accessory work I would usually do when cutting, because frankly I did not like doing most of the movements I had access to. Well after 3 or so months I looked the best I had. No noticeable muscle loss despite chopping off a good deal of my volume from previous cuts.

**The fatigue levels you need when bulking are higher than what you need when cutting**. This is very closely tied to the previous point but the general idea is that you need to be maintaining a constant state of mild fatigue in order to grow. Continuing to push yourself despite incomplete recovery is what prompts the body to adapt, so that it can perform those actions without fatigue accumulation later. Now I want to be clear that I am suggesting you need a constant *mild* level of fatigue. You can absolutely over-do it and accumulate *too much* fatigue, this is not the goal and is also counterproductive. When cutting, you are not trying to promote adaptation of your muscles, so you do not need this steady level of fatigue. 

**The exercise selection needed when bulking is probably more expansive than when cutting**. Again, this ties closely into the last two ideas. In order to generate the stimulus that will create the fatigue in the muscles you want to grow you are probably going to want a wider spectrum of movements. You want to be able to keep pushing all your muscles to the proper limit, and not let weak links hold back stronger areas. This is why isolation work and variations are valuable and important to include in your bulking programming (I am purposely using the wishy washy words in this section, please don’t tell me how you really don’t need isolations in the comment section. I know, skin cats and whatever, I am speaking generally here). When cutting, you might not need as many of these isolations or variations as even when your main compounds are being limited by one muscle group you are still getting some stimulus to the stronger ones and that is probably enough. 

So now we know (or at least that I think) that bulking requires **higher volume, higher fatigue, and more varied exercise selection** and that cutting requires **lower volume, lower fatigue and less varied exercise selection**. Let’s take a look at what you need in your training to reach PR lifts (or at least to reach them more easily). 

To lift at your full potential and **display your strength** you generally want to include the following components: 

**Low Fatigue**: Fatigue, while very important in promoting hypertrophy (and strength *gain*) through adaptation, is not beneficial to demonstrating your potential. If your body is tired it is not performing at 100%. I think this is obvious, but will outright state it here both to be safe and because it’s a component of this argument. 

**Higher Frequency of the Lifts you care about**: This is another area where you could make a counter argument but generally speaking more time practicing a lift is going to improve your technique and increase your *specific strength* in that lift. This applies to all time frames. Years of constant practice will (or at least should) make you better at a lift, but a lot of practice in a short period really puts an extra honed edge on your technique for the duration (at least in my experience and the experiences of others I know).
Lower Overall Volume: this is mostly for the purpose of reducing fatigue, but I am stating it directly for the sake the argument. 


Now, if you are starting to see the picture I am trying to paint great, if not I will spell it out now. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals during a bulk are **directly opposed** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals when cutting are **permissive** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. To put it in other words, trying to program for PR lifts when bulking would impede your ability to develop muscles, but trying to program for PR lifts when cutting will not impede your ability to maintain it. 

It ultimately comes down to opportunity costs. Running PR programming when bulking would give you the very best results in terms of displaying strength, but would come at the cost of sacrificing muscle gain and ‘wasting’ your bulk. Running PR programming during a cut will give *slightly* (and I do mean this, I do not think you are sacrificing very much in the way of potential due to being in a caloric deficit) reduced results, but comes at no opportunity cost, as the PR programming meets the requirements for maintaining muscle mass. 

________________________________________________________________________

**HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR TRAINING**

Having covered the *why* of this kind of training, let’s take a general look at the *how*. 

If you want to summarize how you should be approaching training under this philosophy it should be like this: Bulking is for Building, Cutting is for Revealing. Your bulks should be structured with a focus on building muscle, building strength, and generally improving your potential. Cutting should be structured to focus on losing fat to reveal that muscle, and peaking your strength to reveal it in the form of PRs. 

**Bulking:** There are *a lot* of correct way to go about bulking. I am not going to go into too much detail about the how here. If you are a relatively advanced lifter you probably have a good idea of what kinds of programming you like and what is effective for you. If you aren’t then, like I said earlier, this post isn’t *really* for you but here are some programs to look into that I either have run and could support for this purpose or have heard enough good things about to safely suggest:

-nSuns 531LP/CAP3 

-531 Building the Monolith, BBB, or really any leader program (I think, I’m not really a scholar of 531)

-Deep Water Training (I should plug /u/MythicalStrength ‘s Mass Building program review where he ran a combination of 531/DW. Go read that if you want to know how to bulk good). 

-Average 2 Savage 2.0 or whatever it is called now. 

-John Meadows Stuff in general, more specifically Gamma Bomb. 

This is not an exhaustive list, go ask big and strong people what they ran to get big and strong. 

**Cutting:** This I will go into a bit more detail as it’s the part that is going to differ more from the norm than the bulking portion. Here you are going to want to choose or design programming that includes *lower volume* and *higher frequency* in whatever lifts you are trying to PR. I think the key here is you need to narrow in on, and pick one or two lifts that you want to try and grab PRs on. You can only have high frequency of so many things before you stop having low volume. I would suggest one or two lifts. If two, pick an upper and a lower. I would suggest really putting your focus during the cutting period on your compound lifts. You want to spread the stimulus around while conserving your energy so compounds are going to be very efficient for you. Keep your accessory work to a minimum. 

I am a big fan of two compound lifts a day, an upper and a lower, then accessories. If you choose something like this you would want to include maybe one pair of accessory movements after the main lifts, maybe 3-4 sets, that’s it. If you only want one compound a day you could have 3-4 accessory movements. But again, the goal here is to *maintain*. The extra work beyond that is mostly wasted on accessories, save it for putting more intensity into your focused main lifts. 

If you have a different method of peaking/honing strength feel free to use it obviously. I don’t have a very long list of programs that are suited for this but I could suggest looking at:

-[Simple Jack’d](https://reddit.com/r/SimpleJackd/comments/qj546t/previous_versions/), specifically the earlier versions with 1-2 focused lifts performed daily


-28 Free Program (Nuckols): using a 3 day plan for your chosen lift and one day of the others would probably get you pretty close to what you are aiming for. Make sure to customize the listed accessories a bit or you will end up with a lot of lower if you choose something like 3 Day Squat/1 Day Bench/1 Day Dead. 

**Cutting and Bulking Lengths:** 

I personally feel that this system works better with shorter, more frequent cycles, rather than the 6-9 months bulk/3 months cut before summer that is more common. I think that shorter periods are better *period* for more advanced lifters but that’s another topic. The reasoning for this is that while you can definitely grab PRs during a deficit, you are ultimately revealing strength potential you already have, not developing anything new. This means that once you peak up to that potential there really isn’t anywhere else to go. In my experience that is going to happen in the first 3-6 weeks. After that you can obviously keep cutting but you are losing out on the benefits of the system. By using shorter cuts and bulks you can have your body composition goals reached by the time you top out on your PRs and you can go right back on to building. 

If you are dead set on the longer cut and bulk periods I would suggest periodizing your cut. Pick a lift to focus on, get it up to PR, then back off on it and move on to focusing on another lift to get a PR on, repeat as needed until you are done with your cut. 

I should also mention that you should not be choosing the same lifts on back to back cut periods if you are using a shorter cycle approach. Say your bulks are 10-12 weeks. How much potential do you really think you built on a specific lift in that time period? The answer is not that much. Pick something you have not focused on in a while as it will have a bigger backlog of unrealized potential to tap into.

**How to Structure your Focused Lifts and When to PR:**

If you are trying to build up your own programming I am going to suggest what I use, and that is high frequency, up to every day, for your focused lift(s). What this is going to look like is probably 3-6 fairly easy days and 1-2 harder days per week.

 You want the easier days to be just that, easy, remember the goal is to *minimize fatigue* most of these days are just to accumulate technical practice to really fine tune your lifts. I recommend a ‘daily minimum* in terms of total reps and weight used and build up from that. I shamelessly stole this general idea from the Simple Jack’d programs. This means you might have a minimum of X reps at Y weight. You do this every session at least. If you aren’t feeling it during warm up its fine to just do this minimum and call it a day. Make it super easy and do it as X singles if you really want. Just get it done. If you *are* feeling it you can build up. Do X+5 reps at Y, or X reps at Y+20lbs, or X+3 reps at Y+15lbs, whatever. If you do build up things should still say pretty easy, if you are grinding reps you have gone too far. 

 You can plan for the harder days to be a specific day of the week or just take them when you feel like things are moving well. You can use a specific goal for the heavier days or just go in thinking “I’m going to see where I get to but I’m going to make sure it’s hard”. This system really is about self-regulation. If you suck at that maybe do something else. 

When it comes to deciding when you are going to PR you can plan it out or just go by feel. I mostly do the later. If you are moving your warmups and your first working set(s) super well and think it’s a good day to push then go for it. You could also go with using a planned ‘hard’ day as a PR day There are no wrong answers here. 

I will caution against a trap I constantly fall into and that’s rapid PR attempts. It’s easy to hit a PR that moved really well/better than expected and think you can totally do more the next day or the day after and grab another PR right away. You might, but really this is very counter-productive. PRs are very fatiguing, and every attempt, or failed attempt, is eating into your chances for another at some point in your cut. Unless you are at the end of your cut and just want to give it a shot because you are done after that either way give yourself a gap and a series of ‘easy’ days to shed fatigue and get yourself set up for another proper attempt. 

_______________________________________________________________________

**MY LAST CUT: AN EXAMPLE:**

My last cut lasted for ~5 weeks, I started in the 275lb range and ended in the 255lb range. Half of that is my regular water shift between deficit and surplus so I lost ~10lbs of actual mass. I cut on hard deficits because I do not find them very hard to maintain and they do not seem to hurt my progress. They allow me to get solid results in the short time-frames I allot for bulking. It’s also worth nothing that I am a giant (6’5”) with an enormous TDEE. I’m still consuming a lot of calories/nutrients when at a deep deficit. You might not have as much luck trying to copy the degree of this deficit if you are not large and highly active. I consume ~3500 calories when cutting and ~6000 when bulking. I have a rough overview of the specifics here:

>Here is my ~5.5-6k Bulking Diet (6'5"" ~265) 

>My 'core' diet which is all I eat while cutting is [here](https://imgur.com/a/3jhMs3z)

>That's ~3500 once you factor in sauces/condiments/all the other odds and ends I use for flavor. 

>When bulking I add the following: 

>2 servings of oats a day (300cal) 

>A snack mix consisting of Cheerios, dry fruits, and some nuts. I fill an old 2 gallon whey tub with it weekly and eat the entire thing over the course of the week. ~5.5k cal total, 790 cal a day. 

>A large jar of peanut butter a week, 6460/week, 920/day

>2 bags of popcorn chips and yogurt dip, 1700/week, 240/day. 

>Total/Day: 3500+ 300 + 790 + 920 + 240 = 5750/day plus whatever other odds and ends I might eat because I'm not restrictive about things like snacks at the office when bulking.

I actually underestimated the snack mix when I wrote that as I didnt have the bags at the time, its over 6000 total but you get the idea.

My cardio consists of a total of 6 miles walking with my dog daily and a 5000m row on my erg before dinner most nights. I do this when bulking and cutting. The 5k is not particularly high paced, I complete it with a 2:05-2:10/500m split average and watch TV while doing it. 

My training consisted of Log Press every day with a minimum of 205lb x 6. I went higher when I felt good and picked my PR attempts on the fly. I hit the higher rep PRs near the beginning of my cut and the low rep PRs at the end. I don’t have too much more to say about this it was almost entirely self-regulated and my goal for it was to improve my log press max and hit a bodyweight rep If I could, which I did do during the last week. I had a lot of success with this type of scheme for bench on my last cut, finally reaching 405lbs. I think I will keep using it for upper body lifts as long as it works. 

Two days a week I squatted low bar. These were just a few low rep sets at moderate intensity. My main goal for this lift was to get back into the habit (my last training block was entirely focused on front squats so I could hit my goal of 500lbs). I did not plan to PR on this lift but by the end things were moving so well I made the 545x3 PR when I decided to perform a single, hitting the double if it felt really good. After how well the second moved I decided to push for the 3rd and I think the 4th would have been a coin toss if I tried it. Based on that I felt pretty confident I could manage 605, which I did on the last week of the cut. I think that the fact I got two solid PRs despite no planning/specific training really speaks to how effective reducing your fatigue levels can be. 


Five days a week (the days I did not squat) I deadlifted. Deadlifts had the most structure of all my lifts. I decided to attempt a height progression training strategy in order to try and reach 585x20. I bought 12 .75” thick rubber paving tiles from a home improvement store. I stacked them up into 2 stacks of 6 (4.5”) to use as pulling blocks. Each week I pulled 5 reps of 585 from the blocks, and on the fifth day I pulled the set of 20. I then removed tiles from the stack each week, repeating the same day scheme at each height. The heights used were 6 tiles (4.5”), 5 tiles (3.75”), 3 tiles (2.25”) and no tiles (from the floor). I originally planned on a tile a week but I had a hard end time for this cut because I was flying out for a week to go to a wedding (I actually types this entire novel on the flights) and did not want to make the 585x20 from the floor attempt right before the trip in case it ended up tweaking something. I succeeded on every set and reached my goal of 585x20 from the floor in the 4th week. 

After this I stopped deadlifting. I was pushing for 600x20 all though my last bulk and never broke 15. 585x20 is roughly equivalent to 600x19 so it is still a huge jump. I actually really liked the height progression and will be using it in the future. I think it did a great job of letting me build up a lot of work at heavy weights while still keeping things in check fatigue wise. It also did wonders for building confidence in the lift. Knowing I *just* did the set of 20 last week from a slightly higher position made it very easy to hit the next one. It also taught me to grind even harder, I hit many reps that I probably would have called impossible before this block. 

My accessory work was preformed after the main work, and was very minimal. I used an Arms, Upper, Lower split for my accessory work, and had one day a week be a rest from accessory work. While I don’t think that the specific accessories are really at all relevant or helpful for me to list I will write out everything I remember because I assume someone will ask at some point. 

*Arms:* Double Single Handle Tricep Extensions/Bicep Curls, DB Incline seated curls, Dips, Cable Overhead Extensions and Rope/V bar push downs. I also did some Poundstone Curl sets and Poundstone Extension sets. 

*Upper:* Incline DB Hex press, Barbell bench press, SSB tricep/upper chest extension, Dips, Cable pulldowns, cable rows, SSB upper back row, Single arm ‘DB’ rows with a loaded kettleball handle, Trap Bar rows. 

*Legs:* Leg press, GHD curls, Calf raises

"I've seen a few posts about this but not too many answers. I'm a generally happy, calm person, not depressed but a bit prone to anxiety. I've noticed that over the last few years, exercise has gradually made me feel more anxious afterwards. Especially cardio (running or dance) or anything strenuous (like heavy weights), but even with more easy going workouts (yoga or a hike), I'll feel it. It seems to trigger an adrenaline or cortisol response, which lasts for a whiiiile. It makes sense to me, I think my body just assumes we're running from a tiger and it triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. My body feels stressed out after, for at least a few hours, if not the rest of the day, and I feel like my brain goes a bit fuzzy.

I feel fantastic when I'm exercising, just not so hot after, and it's really putting me off exercising at all. If I don't exercise, I feel happy and calm throughout the day. I try to make sure I'm eating a good diet, whole foods and enough calories. I don't eat sugar really, or take any stimulants. It doesn't seem to be common, but I see a few people on here share the same problem.

Things I've tried:  
Cooling down slowly  
Trying to not raise my heart rate too high  
Breathing exercises to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system afterwards

If anyone has had this problem and found a solution, I'd love to hear it. Or ideas from anyone else! If you've made it this far, thanks!!

"I’m 21, male. My height is 6’1ish and weight goes between 184lb to 190lb( mostly stays at 186). I do not have the best diet, I eat some junk food sometimes and sugary stuff. My sleeping routine is messed up even tho I started sleeping early and get 7/8 hours of sleep. Done with the informations, I started lifting about less than 2 months ago,  my aim is always been strength, I don’t really care as now to be cut and lean (aesthetic), I’d rather be big and bulky with some strength. Here’s my progress in the 3 main compound exercises: my bench went from 115lb 1rm to 185 1rm as now, I set my goal to bench 225 1 rep max by the end of 2021. My squats went from 185 1x4 to 225 lb 1x5 and my deadlift went from 315 1rm to 1x5 and my 1rm is 365. So the question is how is my progress? I really want to have powerlifting numbers one day, bench 495, squat 600 and deadlift at least around 800. These are veryyyyy big numbers and professional powerlifters number and I KNOW IT WILL TAKE YEARS to even come close, but I’m fully committed to take this path in life. Do you guys think it will be possible for me? Do I have potential? Thank you",fitness

[Before and after pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/1qfkqUg) Too be honest these aren't the best pictures to represent this. I was never going for looking bigger, just being stronger. I never thought to take a proper before/after picture because of this. So, yeah this is as close as it's going to get! (And to be honest I think the front squat PR video gives you a decent idea of body size change!)

**The template I followed after 531 BBB (I call it 531 x 365, with actual credit of the title coming from** u/3pIcenTer\*\*):\*\*

531 has so many templates and I’m stubborn. So I made up my own. It’s very basic and anyone with a basic understanding of 531 programming should get the idea of it. Without going into it too much, 531 usually has 3 main sets followed by 5 supplemental sets. Not always, but that’s the pattern that most templates follow.

I wanted something that mimicked a cycle of volume, followed by a cycle of intensity, and worked up to a yearend total. (Approximately a year, a little less than that) So I present to you the 531 template that you can run for almost an entire year. Once it’s over, retest your maxes, enter a new TM (if it’s lower than the current, always use the lower number) and then repeat over and over until you die.

I call it 531 x 365. (Get it, because you can do it all year) I used a 90% TM, but if I were to repeat it I would probably use a 85%. Maybe even an 80%.

**How it works:**

Supplemental work changes every cycle, main work follows traditional 531 programming. Supplemental work is always based off of the increased TM. I chose to increase all of my TM’s by 5 pounds except for my OHP which I increased by 2.5 pounds a cycle.

**Cycle 1: Volume**

4 day split, OHP, Squat, Bench, Deads each having their own day. Preferably rest day after two days on, then 2 more days on, then 2 rest days. Works great as a Monday, Tuesday, off on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, off on the weekend schedule. Do what you have to do though.

Cycle 1 focuses on volume for the supplemental work. Do your 3 main sets and then your supplemental sets will look like this.

* 5 sets of 12 reps of 45% of your TM. Repeat this same weight for the entire cycle for your supplemental work.

**Cycle 2: Intensity**

Supplemental work done as:

* 5 sets of 6 of 75% of your TM

**Cycle 3: Volume**

* 5 sets of 11 at 50% of your TM

**Cycle 4: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 5 at 80% of your TM

**Cycle 5: Volume**

* 5 sets of 10 at 55% of your TM

**Cycle 6: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 4 at 85% of your TM

**Cycle 7: Volume**

* 5 sets of 9 at 60% of your TM

**Cycle 8: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 3 at 90% of your TM

**Cycle 9: Volume**

* 5 sets of 8 at 65% of your TM

**Cycle 10: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 2 at 95% of your TM

**Cycle 11: Volume**

* 5 sets of 7 at 70% of your TM

**Cycle 12: Test Maxes or Do TM test, adjust to the lower TM and start over from the beginning.**

By lower TM I mean the following:

You start with a TM of 200 on bench press. After 12 cycles your TM is now 260. When you test your maxes you find out that your actual max for bench is actually 260. Using the 90% TM means the new TM you would use is now 235.

In a different example, you started with a 200 pound TM on bench, but when you test your new max you actually bench 300. This would suggest that your new TM should be 270, but stick with the 260.

Stick with the lower number and you’ll have less chances of getting stuck. What do you do if you get stuck? Follow normal 531 protocol. I never stalled on this programming.

**Accessories:**

Do what 531 programming suggest or do your own thing. I did my own thing and had great success with it.

I reached my strongest point by doing the following for accessories.

1. Find a TM for your accessory just like you would a main lift. Either max out or find a top set of 3-5 where you couldn’t do more reps. Then take a 90% of that to get a TM.
2. Take your TM and take 70% of that and 50% of that.
3. Do 3 sets at 70% of your TM like this: 5, 5, 5+
4. Do 2 sets at 50% of your TM like this: 10, 10
5. Keep the same weight for the entire cycle and just try to beat your + set
6. If you could get all of the minimal reps on all 5 sets (at least 5 on the 3rd set) then increase the weight by the smallest amount possible. If it’s a machine that goes up by 2.5 pounds then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a bar that you can put 2.5’s on either side then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a machine that you can add 10 pounds to as the minimal number then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If you can’t complete the reps then either lower the weight or repeat the weight next cycle.

**My bench day accessories:**

* Row, lateral raises, close grip bench (giant superset thingy)

**OHP day:**

* Weighted dips, Chest flys/superset with reverse flys, rows

**Deadlift day:**

* Lat Pulldowns, shrugs, leg extensions superset with leg curls

**Squat day:**

* Split squats, weighted back extensions, lat pulldowns

Ab rollouts or hanging leg raises every day. If I had extra time I would do a facepull/tricep superset with the ropes or a curl/forearm curl superset.

Some kind of conditioning every workout and on most rest days.

My accessories often changed if I got bored or wanted to train for a specific event, but for the most part I would keep them the same so I could track progress. Sometimes I would do cleans with an axle bar or regular bar after a squat or deadlift workout. Sometimes I’d do incline bench press instead of close grip bench. Sometimes I would do leg press, hack squats, or smith machine squats instead of leg extensions or split squats on one of my lower body days.

**Conditioning:**

Usually done every day. I would often rest on the weekend and not do too much. Conditioning always changed based on the current needs. If I had nothing to prep for it was just sled pushes/pulls, jogging, sprinting, and bike.

If I was prepping for a comp it was usually comp specific. High volume lift representing the strongman event. Tire flips, vehicle pushing, sled pushing, power cleans, carrying stuff, etc…

**Other:**

Every other week or so I would skip my Wednesday rest day and take Friday off so I could train strongman events on Saturday.

**Diet:**

I usually ate quite a bit. Between 3,500 – 4,000 calories for the most part unless I was cutting weight. I often cut shortly after comps because I liked to drop 5-10 pounds and then bulk up into my next competition. Felt like I was stronger if I was gaining weight so I never went into a competition dropping body weight. It has worked pretty well. I’ve brought home some cool strongman trophies!

I just tried to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I ate like every 3 hours because sometimes I would get caught up and not eat enough to go along with my training.

Supplements? Just some caffeine and creatine. Fish oil.  Mostly pizza.

**Findings:**

The first week of the new cycle was always a killer. Week 2 was much better and by week 3 the supplemental work felt like I was throwing it around. It wasn’t uncommon that I had to rest for the last set or two of the supplemental work on week 1. Maybe on OHP I would have to Push Press most of the last set. Deads turned into touch and go’s, etc…

Other than that I really liked it. I would almost get nervous/excited for a new cycle and I really liked knowing exactly what I was working towards for almost the entire year.

At first I was able to push the + sets early on. As the TM’s got heavier and heavier I was doing 5 pro’s more often. I think if I would have picked the lower TM this wouldn’t have been an issue and the next time I run this that’s the plan.

**Random notes:**

I love doing the supplemental work as a variation of the main work. The important thing is to use the appropriate TM for the different work. I don’t suggest basing it off of the TM of your main work.

For the most part I would pause my main bench sets, but do touch and go’s on the supplemental.

Trap bar the main deadlifts (if I was preparing for a car deadlift) and conventional deadlifting the supplemental.

Using front squats or SSB squats as the main work and doing the supplemental as back squats.

Using the log or axle every now and then on OHP, etc…

**What’s next?**

I’m going to challenge myself in the next weight class in strongman. I’m going to follow BBBeefcake, BTM, and deep water. The goal is to gain 20 pounds, then follow it up with 12 weeks of other programming while I cut 10 of those pounds back off. Repeat for another 20 pound gain and then another 10 pound cut. That will put me right around 225 body weight, a nice place to be when competing in the 231 weight class as I can go into comps gaining weight like I usually do. Maybe I get fluffy. Maybe I look buff. At the end of the day I don’t care too much as long as I get stronger.

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

"I have had a good search of online articles and reddit forums and as far as I can tell, exerting yourself as much as possible for shorter periods of time as opposed to less exertion over a longer period of time does not differ much in terms of the benefits of the exercise, apart from some extra testosterone for men (which doesn’t apply to me) and a slight increase to the benefit to the cardiovascular system.

I ask this because many people who are interested in exercise seem to say that feeling the “burn” and really pushing yourself is really important and insinuate the benefit is far greater this way. 

Can anyone more knowledgeable shed any light on this for me?",fitness

"Hi all!

Just looking for a bit of advice really.

I’ve been off and on with gyms for the past few years and then when covid hit, really got back into going to the gym again, messy breakup, big focus on myself!

My new partner is really into CrossFit, so I thought I would give it a go, and fell in love aswell. My main concern about a standard gym was me not actually taking the time and effort to do any cardio, having asthma I was always scared too, but doing this has pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Anyway, the coaches have great WODs programmed in and do to Oly session on the weekends. But I really miss doing some good old strength training to go alongside it. I was doing a PPL at the time, but the CrossFit gym doesn’t have all the same equipment so I thought I would just focus mainly on the CrossFit and metcon. 

Now I want to get my strength back to similar/better level so I’ve been looking at strength programs again, but I don’t want to spend hours in the gym as each class with the warm up is roughly 45/60 mins. 

Can anyone help or may if had a similar situation in the past and what they did to have CF and a strength program side by side? I was looking at simple 5/3/1 but wasn’t too sure if it was enough.

Thanks all!


TLDR- I’m looking for a strength program  (5/3/1-PPL - just on a faster scale)to go side by side with programmed CrossFit workouts.",fitness
"Hey all!

I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner.

The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it.

My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max).

My questions are:

1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work?
2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process?
3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change.
4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)?
5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much?

In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5. 

Thanks everyone!",fitness
"**Preface**: 

This post is going to present a series of ideas on how to approach ‘form’ as a concept in lifting and it’s application. These ideas represent the thoughts and opinions on the subject that I have built over almost a decade of lifting [heavy things](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWN6v-0gSv-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with [form](https://youtu.be/8E-iMybhQUo) that has been called [questionable](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWvYzWQgGzL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), going so far as to even win a [World Championship]( https://www.instagram.com/reel/CW_MAuRJ0YT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) in lifting unusually and in an excessive manner. That said almost everything I am going to talk about here is theoretical/conceptual, and it is what *I* think. I am not presenting facts, nor am I suggesting that anything here should become a fact. The goal is to present a viewpoint that is outside of the common understanding of form, with the hopes that you, the reader, will refine your own views on the topic. If you are convinced and agree with everything I say great, if you agree with some and move your views to something in between cool, if you think about what I am saying here and reject all of it that is okay too. The only thing I want here is to make you think more deeply about something that most people just write off as a simple and obvious topic. 

 I know that many people feel strongly about the importance of form when lifting, so I ask you to please read what I am writing and give the ideas presented a fair shake before running to the comment section to tell me how wrong I am. I intend to write this in a manner that it can be understood and processed by anyone, I will not be including complex anatomical jargon or links to dense studies that most people are not equipped to work with, and I will do my best to explain every term I am using and explain any relevant background information. That said if I am unclear in anything please feel free to ask for clarification. 

Like I did in my last post, I am going to give a short breakdown of what I will be writing about then I will get into it. 

**What Form is, and how it differs from Technique**: The first section will define ‘Form’, its counterpart ‘Technique’, and explain the differences. This is an important distinction to make both in terms of the rest of the post, and in thinking about ‘Form’ in general. 

**Why there is no such thing as ‘Perfect Form’**: The second section will look at why there is no such thing as a universal form/technique, and why individual variables, training purpose, and other factors can all influence the form/technique used. 

**Form and Injury**: The third section will cover the relationship between form and injury risk, and present an argument for thinking about injury risk as a function of load, not form. 

**Practical DOs and DON’Ts**: The final section will tie the previous ideas together into some applicable DO’s and DON’Ts.

With that out of the way lets get into the meat of the post.
___________________________________________________________________________
**What is Form, and what is Technique?**: 

The very first thing we need to do to discuss form is define what it is and is not. Form, by formal, general definition, is ‘the *visible* shape or configuration of something’. This definition applies to form in the context of lifting as well. Form is the *visible appearance of a lift, as seen by an outside observer*. This seems obvious, but this definition is important when separating form from technique. 

Technique, conversely, encompasses everything you do, consciously or unconsciously, when executing a lift. Every action you take, whether you think about it or not, to move a weight from point A to point B is part of technique. Technique is what you should be pushing to refine and improve on. Improved technique is ultimate goal, not improved *form*. 

So how does technique differ from form? The distinction sits in the ‘visible’ part of the definition. **Form is the external, visual, manifestation of technique.** Now I am well aware that this *sounds* like a pedantic distinction without merit but I think that it is very important. You cannot see every part of technique. You cannot actually see the interplay between muscle groups or the activation of each individual fiber, you cannot see the thought processes that go into activating the these muscles, you cannot see resulting forces on the weight and every bone, muscle, and joint in the body. What you *can* see is the results of those things in the way they move the body and the weight, and that is ‘form’. With form you can only *approximate* what is going on in terms of technique. 

Form is one of the few tools available to look at someone’s technique as an outside observer, but it’s limitation’s must be understood and respected. You must understand that when reviewing form you are observing a portion of the *results* from a set of actions, and then you are extrapolating what actions must have occurred to create those results. Form can never give a perfect insight into someone’s technique. With enough viewpoints and the right experience to interpret them you can get a pretty solid understanding of the technique involved but it’s still ultimately an indirect assay and thus imperfect. 

It is even more difficult to work with form in most practical settings. Unless the lifter is wearing extremely tight clothing, or no clothing at all, visual information is going to be obscured by clothing hanging in the way. Unless you are walking in circles around the lifter, viewing multiple sets from every angle you are not getting a full 360-degree view of the lift. Online it is even worse, you are getting a single (usually questionable) angle with which to view the lift in the form of a video. Not only is there an inherent disconnect between visual form and physical technique, but you are often working with an incomplete visual. This makes the final approximation even worse. 

Before moving on I want to look at a practical example to really hammer the point in: 

Picture someone deadlifting, who has some back rounding under their loose gym shirt. You can see the ‘form’ (a back that is rounded to some degree) but what can you say about the technique? Are they a beginner who is struggling to maintain a braced position and is being bent over by the weight? Or are they more experienced, purposefully maintaining that torso position while fully braced in order to effectively start from a higher position? One form, two potential technical causes. One is ineffective and should probably be corrected if the lifter wants to move more weight, the other is fine. You can use other clues to help inform that decision: how much is the lifter pulling? Do they have a level of musculature that suggests they are experienced? Is the back static or actively rounding? With this context you can make a solid assumption about technique, but the form of ‘rounded back’ does not inherently tell you what their technique is, nor if it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 

__________________________________________________________________________
**The Problem with ‘Perfect Form’**:

I am going to start by outright saying that perfect form does not exist. It cannot be achieved, it should not be a goal, and you should never try to impose it on yourself or another lifter. There are multiple reasons why this is true, and I will break them down in this section. 

***Form is not a goal***: The first point ties into the something I mentioned in the last section, and that is that *technique* should be where your focus lies, not the resulting form. With some exceptions for when form dictates what a lift is, or it’s competitive standards, the way your lift looks does not matter in the slightest. Yes, a competition squat in powerlifting needs to include your hip crease dipping below your knee line, but how the rest of the lift looks Does Not Matter. Effective technique does generally result in a certain spectrum of visual forms but outliers exist and putting the effort into making a lift look a certain way is getting the technique-form relationship backwards. **You should be trying form changes to see if they improves your technique, not changing your technique to see if it makes your form look better. **. Form is one tool for communicating and implementing technical changes, but that is it, it is not something that you should change your technique for because it has inherent value. If form is not something that you are trying to directly achieve there can be no reason to try and ‘perfect’ it. One could argue that *technique* could be perfected, but I would disagree there too. 

***We are not made equal***: Human anatomy has a high degree of variance. We are not built equally so it stands to reason that we should not lift equally either. Telling a 6’5’’ lifter with long limbs to perform a squat in the exact same manner as a 5’2’’ lifter with very short limbs is ridiculous. Limb to torso proportions, femur to total leg proportion, muscle insertions and origins (where a muscle is attached to bone), joint angles, and uncountable other variables all impact the specifics of a lifters most effective squat technique. In addition to the anatomy one is born with past injuries, personal preference, equipment choice, and other non-anatomical variables will further impact the specifics of a lifter’s technique. No two people should be lifting the exact same way, so there cannot be a universal ‘perfect’ technique.  

***How you should perform a lift depends on your goals***: Because we are all different, there is no universally perfect technique for a given movement, but *even an individual does not have a singular, personal, perfect technique*. A lifter can use the same general movement pattern for multiple purposes, and what those purposes are is going to impact the technique used. A bench press performed to move the most weight possible is not going to be performed in the same way as a bench press performed focused on building up the chest, or a bench press performed to develop a certain aspect of the technical execution. Which of these is the ‘right’ technique, which is ‘perfect’? None of them are. I guess you could go further and say that each goal for each individual has its own ‘perfect technique’ but at a certain point you are really going past the concept of ‘perfect’ by providing a rationale to call anything perfect.

*We are not machines*: We are incapable of executing a lift in the exact same manner over and over again. Even if there was a ‘perfect’ we could not reliably achieve it. It would be a fruitless endeavor to chase it. Instead we should look at what is a good, or even acceptable, *range* for our lifts. Deviation from the ideal is fine, technique that is just shy of the best still works just fine. Taking this approach not only gives a much more reasonable standard for your reps, but acknowledges that you are imperfect, that you will be fatigued sometimes, that your mind will wander a bit on some sets, and that you will phone it in sometimes. All of that is completely fine provided you stay within the acceptable range for technical execution, and program with that range in mind. Perfect is the enemy of good enough, so choose good enough. Time spent working hard with technique that is good enough will build more strength, size and experience than spending that same time trying to calculate or reach your notion of perfection.
_________________________________________________________________________________
**Form and Injury**: 

I’m going to start this section with another bold statement: no technique, or form, is inherently more dangerous or more liable to injure you than any other. I know this flies in the face of a lot of common opinion on the topic I request that you stick with me for a second. Injury in lifting can, outside of freak accidents or other odd cases, generally be attributed to improper load management, not improper ‘form’.

 Load refers to how much you are lifting, for any given rep or over time. Load management is the process of choosing appropriate weights for your sets, both long and short term. Any movement, with any technique, has a threshold for how much you can effectively lift with it, and exceeding that threshold results in an increased risk of injury. This failure to manage load can be acute, loading up more than you can effectively move for a single rep, or chronic, performing too many reps at a given load over a period of time without allowing time for sufficient recovery. These two are not completely independent, you can be pushing your long term load management a bit too far and open yourself up to an acute event that would not have been as issue if you had been more rested for example. The threshold is also not static, as mentioned above you have a ‘range’ of technique and you have a corresponding range of load thresholds, depending on how on the ball you are for any given rep/set. 

Now how does this tie into technique and form? Technique, and the resulting form, that is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ is just less effective, and thus has a lower load threshold. Lets go back to the example of a deadlift with back rounding, in this case born of an inability to properly brace the torso and not a conscious decision to get better positioning. This is something that is generally considered dangerous, with the implication that lifting like this will injure you. That’s false. It’s not an inherently dangerous movement pattern, its just ineffective and you cannot lift very much with it before you cross the load management threshold to increase injury risk. If you don’t believe that lets do a quick mental exercise. Could you safely deadlift a pool noodle with an unbraced back? How about a 1 inch steel pipe? An unloaded barbell? 135lbs? You had to have answered yes to at least the pool noodle question, and probably some of the others. You already accept that you can safely pick up a trivial weight with this ‘dangerous’ form, so you accept that the variable responsible for injury is the weight used, not the technique. Obviously you should try to use the more effective technique, so you can safely lift more weight, but you are not going to have an excessive risk of hurting yourself using *any* technique, provided you lift within your ability for that movement. 

Now why does this matter? Isn’t it just pedantry? No. Understanding the actual cause of injury in this situation teaches several important lessons that can and should impact your training decisions:

**You need to manage your load**: Even with the best technique you can muster you are still at risk of injury if you lift too much. Good technique and form will not protect you against injury if you are pushing excessive loads and volume. This is usually obvious from the acute standpoint, it is pretty intuitive that trying to lift a lot more than you are capable of is going to chance an injury. The problem of chronic load management is less obvious. You can lift sub-maximally, with solid technique, and still open yourself to injury if you are trying to hit too many hard sets a session/week/month/other time period. Your body gets fatigued with every rep and that lowers its performance. You can’t hit your 1RM over and over again, and you probably can’t go balls to the wall on your sets in some movement 3x a week for months on end. Good programs will manage this but a lot of lifters, even experienced individuals, will push themselves too hard. It’s very tempting to keep up momentum when you are setting back to back PRs for example, but that is not a sustainable trajectory, even with your best ‘form’.

**You are probably not going injure yourself just because your technique is lacking**: The second important thing to realize from this injury model is that *any* movement can be performed with reasonable expectation of safety if you manage your load properly. I see a lot of beginners that are paralyzed by a fear of progression with sub-optimal ‘form’. They believe that they will sustain a severe injury out of nowhere at some point if they do not correct how they lift. While freak incidents can occur, this is not a reasonable fear. Even if your technique is sub-par, if you gradually add weight in a responsible manner you can keep progressing even terrible and inefficient form safely. I believe that this is a good thing in most scenarios. You are going to be more likely to adapt your technique and discover more efficient movement patterns if you are pushing yourself. Your body does not ‘want’ to move the weight in an inefficient manner, if you keep making it lift weights it will slowly find a better way to do it. You will change some little thing on each set and eventually something will click and you will find the weight moving better. If you refuse to keep slowly progressing weight out of fear of your imperfect technique you will not experience this stimulus to adapt. 


**Most serious injuries do not come without warning signs**: Of the two kinds of load management error, chronic and acute, chronic is going to be much more prevalent if you are lifting even remotely responsibly. When you have a chronic load management issue you are not going to be feeling great then suddenly develop an injury. It is a gradual process that almost always comes with some warning signs. If you are lifting too much with your bent back deadlifts, to go back to the last example, you are unlikely to suddenly develop a major lower back injury, you will experience discomfort, additional strain while lifting, or some other precursor before the injury occurs. You can use these warning signs to take proper steps to manage the issue. Accepting that you have these warning signs should open up what you are willing to try. If you are unsure about a technical change, or if something needs to be changed, you can keep working with it if nothing feels off. 

That said, you cannot always see a large injury coming, there is some inherent risk in pushing yourself with any technique. You can’t always see mild or moderate injuries/pain coming, as they can be the warning sign that something bigger might be on the way. You also may not be able to directly assess what is causing your pain in every scenario, sometimes the cause is unclear or unintuitive. You should not be paralyzed by the fear or injury or let it hold you back, but be cognizant it can happen, and that it probably will if you push yourself hard for long enough. You need to strike a middle ground between excessive fear of injury and complete disregard. Despite this, lifting is still one of the safest form of physical exercise in terms of incidence of injury/time spent, so keep that in mind. 

**You can train anything**: Outside of accusations that certain ‘form’ is dangerous on common movement I see a lot of people fully writing off all kinds of movement patterns as inherently dangerous, such as behind the neck presses or pulls. They are not. You can train *anything* with a reasonable expectation of safety provided you start at an appropriate weight and build your way up at an acceptable rate. You might discover at a low weight that a movement does not agree with you, or you might not hit a wall and find that you can build up to heavy weights in these atypical movements. Either way it’s *safe* to explore these movements if you do it properly, because *the technique and form are not inherently dangerous*. Just remember that you have little idea of your threshold with a new movement or technique, so start with conservative loads. 

**If it works, it works**: The final point I want to make is particularly aimed at newer lifters that are watching advanced lifters with unusual execution. I see a lot of people with no appreciable experience telling people lifting very serious weights that they are doing it wrong and are going to injure themselves. This is extremely misguided, and arrogant in my opinion. If someone has cultivated their personal technique to the point where they can lift such an impressive amount of weight do you not think that they have worked out a technique that is compatible with their body? Do you think they accidently managed to lift a weight that less than 1% of lifters could manage by doing everything incorrectly? No, if it works for them it works for them. Their load threshold with that odd technique is high enough to manage the weight, and probably higher than their threshold for a more conventional technique. It probably won’t work well for most people, but it works fine for them. They are not going to hurt *themselves* just because you would hurt *yourself* using a comparable technique. You are different people, with different bodies. To expand this idea, if you find yourself effectively and comfortably moving weight with a technique that is unusual, and ineffective for most other people, don’t try to change it just because it is not normal. It’s working for you, keep exploring it until it does not work for you then change whatever is not working at that point. Don’t try to fix something that is already working.  
____________________________________________________________________________
**Putting it all Together, Do’s and Don’ts**: 

This last section is going to bring all the ideas covered in the previous sections into some actionable Do’s and Don’ts when it comes to using ‘form’ to influence your training decisions and the advice you give to others. 

***DO use form as a source of potential changes for your technique***: I want to start this section by stating that form *does* have a place in making technical changes to your lift. It is very hard, if not impossible, to describe how you should change your lifting technique without framing it as form change. ‘Bring your stance closer’, ‘Try to start with your hips higher’, ‘Break at the hips before the knees’, ‘Touch lower on your chest’ are all examples of form advice that can produce beneficial change in a lifters technique. The SUPER IMPORTANT CAVEAT to this advice is that it is not absolute, everyone is going to lift a little, or a lot, differently. 
Not all lifters will use the most common stances for their lifts, not all lifters should be touching a bench press down at the same spot. It is definetely worth it for newer lifters and those experiencing a plateau in progress to explore this kind of advice, provided it’s coming from an experienced source. But if it does not improve your lift after you have given yourself time to adapt to it you should ditch it. There are no universal truths when it comes to form, and advice is only good and ‘correct’ if it is helpful. 

***DON’T cram yourself into a box and chase an idealized ‘form’***: I’ve said it already, but I really want to stress that form is a *means to an end*, not a goal in of itself. The point of trying to produce a specific form is to cultivate better *technique*. Chasing a specific form, and changing your technique to reach that, is backwards and counterproductive. If a change makes a lift look nicer, but you lift less effectively, or with more discomfort, then it is a bad change. If you find yourself comfortably (or at least a comfortably as heavy lifting gets) lifting more weight with a technique that produces an unusual form then go with it. Looking pretty while lifting is not the goal, at least it is not the goal of strong people. 

***DO frame your form advice as a suggestion, and know when not to give it***: Form policing is a cancer in the lifting community, it really is. It just keeps spreading and it strangles out the healthy, strong viewpoints on technique. You cannot know everything about a person’s lift just from watching a video of it, or from watching it in person for that matter. For that reason you really should structure your advice as *suggestions*, not absolute rules. The goal is to get the trainee to try something differently in the hopes that they discover a technical change that helps them. It’s a tool for guidance. When you tell a new lifter that they MUST lift in a specific way you stifle that discovery and inhibit their ability to find the technique that works best for them. 
Form policing also presents as people giving unsolicited and ineffective advice to experienced lifters. Everyone has room to improve, and almost every experienced lifter realizes this and strives for it. But someone watching a video of their lift and parroting generic beginner form advice is not helping them. It’s not helping anyone. It’s arrogant and condescending.
I have tried to write this entire post in a non-combative and tone, I really do want people that might not be initially accepting of these ideas to at least give them a chance and have tried to avoid putting people on the defensive for that reason. But we are nearing the end and I need to indulge a little bit on this one point and say that if you are form policing you need to shut the fuck up. 

***DON’T cling to form standards past the beginners stage***: This is a bit of an expansion on the point about chasing idealized form above. The general form advice that is given to beginners absolutely has a place. A beginner has no technique on which to build and the only way to really create that initial technique is to present a general form that they should try to imitate. This helps them stumble through their first reps and sets in a relatively safe and moderately effective manner. But these generic beginner form guidelines are *training wheels*. They are an excellent tool for initial teaching but at some point you need to remove them and learn to ride the bike. No one has ever won a Tour De France with training wheels. Don’t cling to them too hard once you have that initial technique down and certainly don’t force them onto more experienced others.

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out.

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

**Many of the readers here in r/fitness are firmly in this category. Learn how to lift, and then move on as soon as you can.**    
  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)**  Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many readers here are in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.",fitness
"I have never seen anybody except for obese people talk about walking as exercise on Reddit. I am curious for myself because I am obese (6'2 and 256) and I'm trying to walk an awful lot because I love it, but I don't do much else exercise.

I'm sure other forms of exercise are better for you (running would benefit you in cardio better, and lifting would benefit you in muscle tone better). But surely walking is much better than sitting on the couch.

What physical benefits does walking give you, and what distances are required to achieve any noticeable benefits?

And what are the differences, in terms of physical benefits, between different kinds of walking (pavement vs. rough, flat terrain vs. hiking up a mountain)?

"**Tl;dr - For maximum success, create a hierarchy of goals and approach them with good vibes.**

[LINK TO EPISODE](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)

New! 1/3/21 - [Link to accompanying article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/goal-setting/)

Tis the season for New Year's Resolutions (NYRs), and [the most recent Stronger by Science podcast](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)  came through with evidence based tips on how to best set fitness goals.  And before you dismiss January 1 as insignificant or primed for failure, SBS shares that rates of success for NYRs aren't that bad.  Six months into the year 69% of people in one study were claiming success, and 55% were still claiming it after 12 months.  ^(19:50)  Additionally, the ""fresh start effect"" that the new year offers is real and able to be leveraged. ^(24:00)

So what does the science say about setting ourselves up for success with NYRs or any other goal?  Establish a hierarchy of goals that all support each other.  ^(30:50)

* Start with a **SUPERORDINATE** goal. Have a big, value- or identity-based goal as an anchor that will provide your ""why.""  It should explain why all your smaller goals matter and act as a motivating force.
* Next have **INTERMEDIATE** goals.  These will be a little less vague and give you a clear route to accomplishing your big goal while still allowing flexibility in the path you take to get there.
* Finally, have **SUBORDINATE** goals.  This is where your SMART goals live for all of you trembling in anticipation of seeing your favorite acronym.  Your subordinate goals set up what you're going to do, how you'll do it, and when it will get done.  These are the goals you interact with on a daily basis.  Because you've set your Intermediate and Superordinate goals, these can be adjusted as needed to find any of the many routes to success.

You've got your hierarchy.  What's next?  SBS reviews what the evidence says will help you meet those goals.

* Identify your specific obstacles, and set your intermediate and subordinate goals to target them.  ^(49:50)  Set an if/then plan for when you will implement behaviors that lead to your goals.  ^(1:23:53)
* Plan not only your actions but your coping when things go wrong.  Challenges will always arise, and you can think through how you'll address them ahead of time.  ^(1:29:20)
* Utilize approach goals instead of avoidant goals.  ""I will eat more vegetables"" instead ""I will not have candy.""  Approach goals are associated with positive emotions and greater well-being, and the evidence supports it's a more successful route to take.  ^(52:50)
* Pair a delayed gratification behavior with something enjoyable in the moment.  For example, listen to your favorite true crime podcast only while you're out for a walk.  This ""temptation bundling"" adds an incentive for your goal based behavior.  ^(1:25:30)
* Piggyback new habits onto ones already established.  ^(1:28:17) 
* Allow yourself flexibility both with diet ^(1:03:34) and other behaviors.  Having some ""slack with a cost"" leads to increased persistence. ^(1:18:00)

One common theme that ran through the goal setting and the achievement strategies was this - NO BAD VIBES.  Setting goals properly and with things you can control will help you succeed.  There is no need for shame or the idea that failure or setbacks are a personal failing. ^(51:30)  Good vibe approaches work.

"I'm assuming everyone's primary reaction is going to be instantly to say buy a rack, barbell, weights instead, although the cost of that also adds up to about $2000-$4000 range. 

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. 

The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.

Personally, I doubt that it's worth the money since there are cheaper home gym alternatives but if tonal were to get cheaper in the next few years, do you think the level of convenience it provides may be worth the money?",fitness

"Hello.

I am a police officer and want to join our **police** elite tactical unit, EKO Cobra. Theses guys are REALLY good.

**First of all, I don't want tips for passing the test. I already can accomplish the required physical limits.**

**This topic is about a** **police special unit. So no endless marches and sleeping in cold mud for days. Nevertheless it's really tough and I want to prepare myself optimal for the tasks.**

**Obviously, I'd be happy if you aren't a member of a special unit but have good knowledge too and answer ;-)**

**2. FYI Video**

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b\_0T4EdbRl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_0T4EdbRl8)

**3. Training contents**

""marksmanship, tactical training, sports, driver courses, abseiling/rappelling, hand-to-hand combat, language classes, etc. Besides the courses taught in the basic training, further specialization is possible in fields, such as parachuting, diving, explosives, or sniping""

**4.** **Tasks**

Anti-terror, personal security for politicians and diplomats, hostage-situation, risky arrests of dangerous criminals, ...

**5. My stats**  
I'm a 6'0 ft (185 cm) tall guy and weigh between 187 and 210 lbs (85 kg - 95 kg), depending on my current focus in training. I trained for strength for a few years and then I just climbed a lot.

Started training with weights two months ago. Doing 2x upper and 2x lower body per week, with focus on basic movements (bench, squat, row, deadlift, press, pull-up, lunge). Especially upper body strength stats are increasing well again and quick at the moment.

**My current strength stats are:**

* Pull-Ups: 13 x BW
* Bench Press: 220 lbs x 10 reps
* Military Press: 145 lbs x 10 reps
* Deadlift: 330 lbs x 10 reps
* Squats: 242 lbs x 10 reps

**Running stats:**

* 1,86 miles / 3.000 m in 12:05 min
* 6,2 miles / 10.000 m in 45:36 min

**My questions**

I am curious how you guys (if you're members of such a unit) train for being fit optimal on duty. You have to be good at just everything. Muscle endurance, strength, anaerobic cardio, aerobic cardio, ....

* How often do you guys hit the weights in the gym?
* Which routine do you train?
* How do your stats look like?
* How often do you do cardio? After leg day it's hard for me to absolve a hard running workout.
* In what unit do you serve?

Thanks in advance.",fitness

Currently, open rewards graininess and maturity too much over shape and lines, Quinton vs Joel is just a recent example. Because of these criteria, the bodybuilders that are winning are older, less shapely, and not in their prime anymore, by a large margin. For example:

2013 NY PRO Ramy, this was his PRIME. Now his waist is wider, muscle bellies are less neat and lats are disappearing. He only won 7 years after he was in his prime

I haven't seen anything posted about it yet, and it may seem like common sense... but a lot of people will be spending time with friends and family today, and there are A LOT of kids on this sub/forum who need to hear this -- There will be lots of food, drinks, desserts, etc., and while days like today may be a diet-conscious person's nightmare; relax and enjoy the day.

Food does not give you happiness, but it's one thing that people come together over, and one day of being relaxed, not stressing, and being normal will not kill you or derail your progress. Days like today aren't ones to miss out on, or to make the people around you feel awkward because you're that person with the prepped food in Tupperware, while everyone else is eating normally. It's not hardcore, it's not that extra 1% that's going to turn you into Ronnie Coleman, it's just not necessary.

Unless you're deep in contest prep, don't be the stereotypical, meathead bodybuilder who doesn't enjoy the food and time with friends/family. Nobody likes that person. We get too little time to spend with the people we care about as-is, so take advantage of today, be present in the moment with the people you love, and make some great memories. Tomorrow you can pick right back up where you left!

P. S. don't try to compensate by eating less tomorrow or doing additional cardio... that's a very slippery slope into an eating disorder. Unless you have a great relationship with food (and even then I still think it's not worth it), just get back to doing exactly what you were before, and pretend the previous day didn't happen.

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out.

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)** Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many of the readers here in /r/weightroom are firmly in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.","powerlifting, fitness"

" First ever meet in the books. Finished with a 3rd place medal and a hunger to compete that has increased tenfold. Extremely happy and proud that I was able to put up a total I’m fairly impressed with.

Went 9/9, which was my only real goal in this contest. Not sure if I got any red lights, as the three judges just held up sheets of laminated paper since the screen wasn’t working on the platform, lol. I just looked at two of the refs each time and never saw any reds. I really hammered the commands and cadence of the lifts into myself before going into this. 

First squat: 185/407
Second squat: 195/429
Third squat: 207.5/457

All three attempts went up lightning fast. I was playing it a little too safe, I wasn’t sure how the adrenaline would affect me, if the commands would be harder than I anticipated, etc. But i didn’t struggle with these nearly as much as I thought I would which gave me loads of momentum going forwards. I’m fairly certain I could’ve added another 10kg on my final attempt that day, but it’s water under the bridge now.

First bench: 135/297
Second bench: 147.5/325
Third bench: 157.5/347 (first among all 105kg jrs)

Bench was always my strongest lift relative to squat and deads, so I knew this was where I could be aggressive and push myself. Second attempt flew, and I planned to only go up to 152.5 but I had to take advantage of the moment, and I managed to make a perfect choice as 157.5 moved very well. I don’t think I could’ve added any more without an extremely ugly form breakdown. 

First deadlift: 212.5/468.5
Second deadlift: 240/529
Third deadlift: 252.5/556 (16lb PR!)

I actually planned on going with 200kg as an opener but I changed it to 212.5 last minute, so I wouldn’t have had to make any big jumps and I could better set myself up for a YOLO third attempt. This ended up being great as I nailed my third attempt, and secured a perfect 9/9 day.


All in all, this was a BLAST !! I can’t wait to compete again. For now my goal is set to get my total up to qualify for nationals, which in the CPU is 652.5 for junior 105kg. Not a huge leap, but a smaller goal I can set my eyes on for the next couple months. Going forward, I know I have to up my squat, which is good as my deadlift will follow. My bench is fantastic where it is now, which is a huge relief.

"Good afternoon and welcome back to Pretzel's Meet Musings **™**, part 8 (!!). 

TL;DR summary: 1070 total @ 179.8 bodyweight, 9/9, BEST DAY

**Prep/Background/Crap No One Cares About Except Me/Etc.**

So after shaking off the bad juju of my [last wrapped meet](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/j5k6bu/f_31_45359_kg_821_kg_4093_wilks_2020_rps_fall/) with an unpeaked sleeved meet in [August](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/p5tbne/meet_report_f_32_42411_kg_814_kg_3962_dots_raw/), I went into this prep ready to a) focus, b) avoid getting married to certain numbers, c) follow the plan and trust it even when I doubted myself, and d) have fun. While I didn't get married to any numbers, I did get engaged in September, and I swear the engagement ring gave me super powers or something. Form of a dragon, etc. But for real, having my fiancé supporting me every step of the way, encouraging me to have fun outside of the gym even when I was deep in prep, and reminding me who TF I am has been unbelievably helpful for me. I also got to see him put up a 99 PR total from his meet in May at the beginning of October, and that really gave me the itch to get back on the platform and show off.

This was my second time doing NOTB, and I can't recommend Laura's meets strongly enough. My next one will be the Women's Pro/Am in April 2022--on PRO DAY!!--and I have had so much fun doing and watching Sweatt Shop meets. You're in for a long day, since there's always a lot of geared lifters, but if you're prepared with food, that's nbd. The judging is always very fair and consistent. The number of ATWR in the building is always absurdly high, too; I mean, Dave Hoff was my head judge for bench and a side judge for squat, Laura obviously, Amy Weisenberg runs the mono, and Leah Reichman is running around helping, not to mention the ATWR competitors actually on the platform. It was an honor to share the platform with my friend Jackie, on the day she broke her own ATWR squat at 148 (!) and with Jeannine Whittaker, back on the platform for the first time in 3 years after back surgery. I had an absolute blast with this meet and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a big regional meet with high level competition. I mean, I was 5th among the raw women and I was well over 1000, so, it's a STRONG meet. 

I remain a conjugate devotee. For this prep, Lones had me do something a little different. All my really heavy deadlifts were within the first 6-7 weeks of the cycle, and I wrapped once or twice a week for the last 5 weeks. I took my last heavy deadlift (440 with reverse light bands) at 5 weeks out, pulled a heavy triple at about a month out (370x3, which was a PR), took my opener at 3 weeks out, and that was it for deads. When I saw the program I thought there was no way my body would hold up and that my elbows would surely depart my body with that much wrapped squatting, but I have never been more confident in a lift than I was in my squat heading into the meet. My platform PR prior to Saturday was 410, and frankly, it was a gift call because it was high and I had missed my first two attempts that day. During this prep I squatted 430 for a 20 lb PR, easily; 455 with reverse micros, easily; 415x2, for a 20 lb PR double; really easy triples on my secondary squat day at 370 and 380; and 357 v 100 in chain. I left some in the tank every one of those training days, which is amazing to me, still. Fiancé helped reel me in to avoid taking really stupid extra reps that would not have been helpful. Shoutout also to my physio who helped keep me in one piece. If you've never tried dry needling, YOU SHOULD. He was at the meet and worked on about 5 of us between bench and deadlift, which is the most clutch thing that has ever happened.

**FOOD AND CUT**

I had been sitting roughly at 183 for most of prep, but two weeks out was my birthday and my family came to visit and do wedding planning stuff. Mom cooked all of the food for me, and I ATE GUD. That resulted in my first ever water cut, which wasn't that miserable, but also not super effective because I'm just not someone who holds a ton of water? So idk, I'll have to find a different protocol for next time. With a little extra sweating and spitting, I made weight easily (in the grand scheme) at 179.8. I didn't have much trouble getting my weight back to about 185 by bedtime, which was where I was sitting at the start of water loading, and I woke up at 181.4 on meet day feeling good.

A note on snacks: I ate an entire bunch of bananas and an entire box of uncrustables through the day, as well as 120 oz of gatorade. I had some oats for breakfast and some more after squat and I never felt over-full, like I was forcing food, or depleted, which is the best balance I've ever had on a meet day. On Friday, I made myself drink salt water, even though it was absolutely foul. This was the first meet where I didn't have a lat/erector cramp absolutely wreck me on bench, and I have to think that extra salt helped. I am also undefeated with Italian food as my dinner pre-meet. 

**MEET DAY (Third attempt videos:** [here)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWPEMW2A9yb/)

* **SQUAT (3/3)**
   * 405 (three whites). EZ PZ. 
   * 435 (two whites). 5 lb lifetime PR and 25 lb meet PR. looked easy, but didn't feel great, so I went more conservative than I had originally planned for my third. [video](https://imgur.com/a/eUFLHa8) of both opener and second.
   * 450 (two whites) 40 lb meet PR!! Exactly the right call for a third and while it slowed down, it wasn't a huge grind and didn't take it out of me for the rest of the day.

HUGE mental catharsis from last fall. I didn't realize how much that was still haunting me. I didn't stress about hitting depth the entire prep because I finally figured out that in wraps, I have to send my hips back before I break at the knees. This was my first meet in the Pioneer wraps and they are the perfect balance of stopping power and spring for me. HIGHLY recommend, particularly if you're a quad-dominant/knees forward squatter like me.

* **BENCH (3/3)**
   * 185 (three whites). Easy but didn't feel awesome, so I remembered my lesson from August and went conservative on my second. I also dropped my rack height a notch and that helped a TON.
   * 195 (three whites). Easy and glorious redemption from missing it twice in August. 5 lb PR. Fiancé called for 205 on my third, but I wanted to be SURE I would nail 200 after missing it last year, so I went conservative again. [videos of first and second.](https://imgur.com/a/uh0BqLa)
   * 200 (three whites) FINALLY I DID IT YAYYYYYYYYYYY. Also, my butt came off the bench and they did not call it, so the lesson here is have a giant ass so the judges can't tell if it's all the way off the bench or not. 

This was the first time in EIGHT MEETS where my back did not cramp during bench!!! Between August and now, I changed my set-up and though my arch isn't as big, I don't cramp nearly as much--so I'm glad I ate the humble pie to make the changes. 195 and 200 were both redemption numbers for me and it's amazing to finally hit 200 where it matters. My bench has a long way to go compared to my other two lifts, obviously, but slowly and surely, it's improving.

* **DEADLIFT** **(3/3)**
   * 385 (3 whites). Felt like air. When I took this as an opener in training, it looked like dogshit even though it was fast, so let that be a lesson to everyone that shedding fatigue is a big deal. This also locked in 1035, which is the qualifying total for the women's pro/am pro day!
   * 405 (3 whites). Moved so fast I didn't realize I had lifted it until I realized I was standing there waiting for the down command. I can't believe I can regularly smoke 400+. [videos of first and second.](https://imgur.com/a/eouvNeq)
   * 420 (3 whites). Lifetime and platform 10 lb PR, with a little in the tank, and my all-time favorite platform moment. I never understood how people could smile at the top of a lift until I did it. 
* **TOTAL 1,070 LBS** **(70 lb meet PR); 9/9**

This was the first time in my powerlifting career that I went 9/9 and the first time I had pounds in the tank. (I went 8/8 and scratched my last attempt a few years ago, but that's not the same). I had absolute confidence in every attempt the entire day. I know visualization, etc. works well for a lot of lifters, but what I've discovered is that going full caveman brain and going ""no brain only lift"" is the secret to keeping me calm and executing the way I have trained on max effort lifts. For most of the week leading into the meet, I really didn't think too much about lifting; I stayed really busy at work, focused on chugging water, and getting good sleep every night. Nothing fancy, just treating meet day like another training day. And it was the most fun training day of my life.

I checked open powerlifting when I got home and turns out I notched the 2nd highest total and squat for 181 wrapped lifters in the APF this year, I'm now the #11 wrapped 181 all time in APF, tied for the #7 heaviest wrapped squat for 181s all-time in APF, and tied for the #22 biggest total for all wrapped 181s (all feds) in 2021. That's...pretty cool and I never expected I'd be anywhere near any of that when I started in 2017 and squatted 242. 

Powerlifting rules, you guys. Next stop, pro day and 1100+.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Background: 
So basically I’ve been actually training towards doing powerlifting since January 2020. I signed up for my first meet then, and a couple months before that meet in October signed up for this one because I felt like I might mess up at the first one(I did) and wanted to have another chance at it. I’m not all the way new to lifting, I did do a bit in high school and was decent at it then as far that goes. For most of my life I’ve been involved in some kind of physical activity except for when I was in a bad/low point of my life in my early twenties where I wasted a lot of time being a piece of shit when I could’ve been living a happy life powerlifting. But that’s a different story and not for this sub. Anyways I’m not sure if that’s the info we’re looking for as far as background but that’s about all I’ve got for you there. Lol.

Training

As far as training goes: I’ve run Unity 2.0 and Program X(2x) by John Meadows leading up to this meet. I also found out about Jim Wendler’s 531 and gave it a shot and have been running it for about 6 months. I start with 531 before running the other program for the first 3 days of the week. I train 5-6 days a week normally . I will sometimes randomly go for a 10 mile run about every 3 months when I get the chance to “knock the dust off” as I call it.  I really need to just do more cardio in general but yeah, you know. 

Diet

So I actually had my diet under great control(staying under calories, hitting my macros, not eating trash) up until about 3 weeks out from this meet. (I know, why would I get lax when I was so close) Well, it really wasn’t a huge difference but it ended up making my cut a little more intense than I wanted it to be. I was normally sitting around 142. When I got to meet week I was about 145. I wanted to compete in the 63kg weight so now I was 7lbs away. I was like okay no big deal, 7lbs is nothing compared to the last incredibly stupid and painful cut I pulled to get into 60kg in my first meet.(I know everyone is cringing) but something that cut did teach me was what my body was and wasn’t capable of doing under extreme stress. But normally, I try to stay on track and eat right to the best of my ability but still not exactly perfect all the time. I strive to get my diet completely on point and keep it there always but it’s always been the hardest thing for me fitness-wise. 

Meet Prep

I actually had just competed Oct. 2nd(about a month before this competition)So I trained normally for 2 weeks immediately after to try and milk that time the best I could. Then, two weeks out I actually remembered about how I had saw stuff about “peaking” on here and didn’t quite know what that meant exactly. (Obv. Knew it had something to do with getting ready for the meet but didn’t know what that entailed) So I looked around on the internet and found a peaking template by Barbell Medicine. I was already about to be two weeks out so I picked the “Advanced Fast Peak” option and started on week 2. I actually loved doing this because I felt like doing the big 3 more just helped me simply in doing these lifts more than once a week. (Besides doing speed bench on Thursday as always) I was feeling super strong on everything and actually really confident going into this meet. I was hitting all my reps with ease and even was able to pause squat with 226(my opener for meet#1 that I failed twice) Other than that I really didn’t have much prep. If you have any more info on peaking or prep you’d want to share in the comments with me I would be super grateful! 

Meet Day 

On meet day I woke up around 3AM to get ready. Packed our cooler and headed for Chicago. It was about a 3.5 hour drive. My amazing husband drove me, bless his heart. He drives/will drive me to all my meets because I’m TERRIFIED of driving on big highways and all around am just a pretty awful driver. I grew up on a dead end gravel road in the middle of nowhere and basically the farthest I’ve ever driven myself is Indianapolis and that’s even taxing on someone like me. Anyways, he’s the best- the real MVP here. So the trip up there wasn’t too bad, I was obviously dying of thirst and slept about 4 hours because I find it extremely hard to sleep on a cut even though all you want to do is sleep? Before I left the house I was exactly 138. We got there about an hour and a half early because of the time change. Waiting around to eat and drink sucked pretty bad and time was holding still. 8:30 finally rolls around and the ladies start walking back to the weigh in area. Most of the female lifters were gathered at this point so I wasn’t going to be shy and end up last in line and I was about ready to keel over if I didn’t get something to drink in the next 5 minutes so I popped up and stood where I figured they would form a line. I step on the scale and you can imagine my surprise when I get there and I’m only 134. I’ve essentially just accidentally lost 11lbs. I only needed 7 or 8 for good measure. This time was different though. This was a 2-hour weigh-in. I immediately drank my hyperaid(electrolyte and glycogen drink by steel that I like) and 3 bottles of water. Then I ate a packed of hostess mini chocolate donettes. I also brought a gallon of chocolate milk and start chugging that here and there. I then proceeded to make myself a giant ham and salami sandwich with Colby jack cheese and ate some chips with it. I also had a couple Oreos. And I drank a Gatorade cause it sounded good. Then by that time it was time to warm up for squat. Also at this time I started to feel real sick. It was also about 100 degrees in the gym bc it was a basement with a shit ton of people in it so I was sweating balls and also feeling like I might puke so I took my belt off when I was warming up. I was worried about how shitty I was feeling but it was game time so I sucked it up. 

Lifts
As some of you may already know, Squat has started to become my worst enemy. Today I didn’t want to risk not getting a total again so I went very conservative to a point where I didn’t really set myself up for success on my third attempt. Even though not oh well because I’m still bitter. 

First Attempt - 92.5kg /204
Something I could get without a doubt ever, because I didn’t want a repeat of failing my first attempt twice.
No reason to really share this video but here it is anyways. 3 Whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/_XvdZ3ncnKU?feature=share

Second Attempt - 97.5kg/214
Should’ve gone to 102.5 because this again was something I was sure of and I’m still mad that I played it so safe here.
3 Whites.
https://youtube.com/shorts/ISg6Z4iWFDc?feature=share

Third Attempt - 110kg/242.5
Got ballsy and decided to go for it, only to choke and forget all my cues and how to squat all together. Husband took a moving picture instead of a video here for some reason but here’s a still shot.

https://imgur.com/a/HejcgYR
Got stuck way down in the hole. Stupid.

Bench 
I was already super relieved to be done with squat and show everyone what I’m really made of. 

First Attempt - 70kg/154lbs
Could do this one even if it was a 5 minute pause. I felt good. Still jumped the command even though I had just told myself .3 seconds earlier to listen, and got no lift. No big deal. 

https://youtube.com/shorts/q5ABCZDjjVM?feature=share

Second Attempt - 75kg/165lbs
Felt great about this one too and went up pretty nicely. 3 whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/BGnMpfhFCIE?feature=share

Third Attempt - 80kg/176lbs
Thought I had this one in the bag but really didn’t take the time to brace correctly and didn’t use any leg drive so I ran out of gas pretty close to the chest. Wish I would’ve went a little lighter on my selection. 

https://youtube.com/shorts/QRKvL2noa-A?feature=share

Deadlift
Felt kinda blah warming up, so I used the same opener as last meet. It served as a good confidence boost and a good last warm-up.
First Attempt - 125kg/275.5
Easy peasy, snapped right up.

https://youtube.com/shorts/z-rGq1A6mww?feature=share
3 Whites.

Second Attempt - 137.5kg/303lbs
Wanted to go heavier than last meet for this one(292lbs) so I went a little bigger to try and set up a good third.
It was a slow lift but I still felt okay about it.
3 Whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/xxqDn7flu-A?feature=share

Third Attempt - 145kg/319.67lbs
Since 303 moved so slowly I didn’t want to go crazy on this one, but wanted to beat my last meet PR. And I did by almost 6lbs which was cool. Wish I would’ve just went all out though kinda and tried something close to 330. Idk what this one looked like unfortunately bc my husband taped the ceiling bc he was too in the moment I think. 

All in all as far as meet quality it was nothing like East Race in South Bend. I definitely got spoiled by that first meet. This one wasnt bad, I just liked it better when there was music blasting. 

Moving forward I am competing yet again this year, December 12th at the Missouri River Open in St. Louis. Trust me when I say I really didnt know what I was signing up for when I so impulsively entered myself in four meets this year. So much goes into a meet, definitely not something you should just wing like I have basically this entire time. But that being said, I wouldn't change any of it, because in just those two meets I've learned a million different things about this sport and had experiences that I will never forget. There's no feeling quite like being out on that platform. Still undecided if I want to put my body through another brutal cut but most likely I will. Hoping in this short time frame to hone in on my squat and bring those numbers up to where I can at least try and make it up in my bench and deadlift. 
After Missouri I'm finishing up my year with one more meet. It's a USPA one called Liftmas and its only about an hour away from where I live, so I said fuck it why not. After that I plan on taking the year off on competing to get better and come back even stronger next year. Don't hold me to that though. Lol. Thanks for reading!

"Still want powerlifting to be my primary activity but would like to throw in some cardio to burn a little fat and be more fit generally. I'm a 42-year-old male, just did squat 380, bench 285, deadlift 512 in competition. Not looking to break any world records so just want to add a little balance to the fitness regime.

Any suggestions or experiences to share for what kind of cardio you've thrown in while still powerlifting to be less fat and more fit?","powerlifting, fitness"
"first meet recap (repost since I didn't have a flair, hopefully it works correctly this time.)

So I’ve never done one of these bare with me, long time lurker first time poster.

I had never even thought I’d ever be competing but thanks to a friend from the commercial gym I was at I learned of this one back in June. Anyhow on to the recap I went 9/9 and I believe I got all white lights on all attempts! All attempts were new state record as well as the overall total for the mens 100kg open class. My 3rds are all linked here ([https://www.instagram.com/inspiring\_vision/](https://www.instagram.com/inspiring_vision/)) most recent post as of me posting this.

Squat: 240kg/540.1lbs, 255kg/562.2lbs, 262.5kg/578.7lbs

They all felt pretty good but my third definitely felt a bit heavy on my back and I just couldn’t get as stable as I wanted. I feel like I maybe had 5ishkg in my. 15lb PR.

Bench: 162.5 kg/ 358.2lbs, 170kg/374.8lbs, 175kg/385.8lbs

Ive been dealing with a shoulder injury for about 4 years and this is by far the best my bench has felt ever, I feel like I had another 7.5-10kg in the tank but I understood the call. 20lbs PR.

Deads: 275kg/606.3lbs, 287.5kg/633.8lbs, 297.5/655.9lbs

This is my money lift but immediately going into the second attempt I got the worst cramps of my life. So we pulled back a bit and went conservative. I’ve hit 675 fairly easily before but I not sure what I had left in the tank due to cramps.

Total: 735kg/1620.4lbs good for 1st place in the mens open 220lbs/100kg class. I had an awesome time and I definitely want to compete again. I don’t think I could have asked for a better first meet. Also I've been into the ""powerlifting style"" training for about 3.5 years (15ish years of total training time), no specific program just lifting as heavy as possible on the compound lifts hitting each one at least twice a week. About 3 months ago I found a powerlifting gym and a coach here in Hawaii and he helped me a ton by getting my technique to a much better point on all lifts and an actual program to follow.","powerlifting, fitness"

Sorry. this is way longer than anticipated. 

**Meet Prep**

I competed July 24th and totaled 645kg@90kg (USPA). I ran a couple of blocks of my own stuff and then ran TSA's 9 Week Intermediate Program with some light pause squats on Day 4 and some shoulder/leg/arm work added in to help with hypertrophy. I hit 235/150/300 the week before running the program to find relative maxes to help guide my training. 

During prep, I had to bow out on several days on squat due to patellar tendinitis and then some bench work at the end due to some arthritic issues in both elbows. Prep was never great. I had some good sessions for specific lifts, but I never could string together good weeks for each lift, and they all felt very inconsistent and uncomfortable for the duration of prep. Sleep was inconsistent due to working 3 nights/week that changed every week and i think that really affected recovery. I also got THE shot 11/29 and never felt right afterward- not making a statement other than that i never felt right afterwards. 

The week of the meet, I ran CBB's meet week since I've done it in the past and it worked nice for me. Openers moved how they should've on Mon/Tue. Felt rough rest of week which included 8 lb water cut. 

**Day of Meet**

I barely slept the night before due to parents being in the house and my dad's insomnia/wandering. They also had all the doors open which threw off spatial awareness. Woke up @ 205.1 lb, had a granola bar, took my normal meds, and drove to the meet to get there an hour early as i normally do.  I weighed exactly 93.00 kg, slammed a Pedialyte, protein shake, and another granola bar. 

\-Squats-

Right at the beginning of warming up for squat, the power went out at the gym (weather), and it cut warm-ups for a lot of us, and others did it in the dark. There was no communication from those running the meet regarding timing or anything until they decided they were ready to roll in 10 min which sucked, so i had to go from 0-225kg in 10 min in a cold gym with stiff knees. 

* Opener: 225 kg- moved okay. Had a TON of pain. Limped off the platform and had to convince my handler to give me more.
* Second: 235 kg- best its moved ever. More pain. Toe-tapped off the platform. Limped around. Had to pee, and with the power outage, had to go out in the 40 deg weather to pee after this which cooled me down a ton. 
* Third: 240 kg- missed. Pain was rough. Knee was swollen

\-Bench- 

It'll moved faster from this point on. Thanks for the patience. Warm-ups were fine. Nothing of note. Had some McDonald's because someone at the meet threw my Chipotle away. 

* Opener: 140 kg- moved great. Was set too high, so I had my rack height lowered by 2.
* Second: 150 kg- missed. Felt a sharp pain in left pec/shoulder area when I unracked and was killing me during the lift. I went and stretched, did some tricep/shoulder work, and hoped for the best for the third.
* Third: 150kg- missed. Was really hurting. Tried a narrower grip to get chest out of the movement. I cramped on the way down and struggled to get it to my chest. 

\-Deadlift-

I considered going lighter on opener to just get through the meet but wanted to push for first and possibly win for deadlift. 

* Opener: 272.5 kg- missed. Was thrown off by how the stiff bar felt and how smooth it felt, so I relaxed and this isn't a weight to relax with. Let's move up
* Second: 287.5 kg- missed. They said there was downward motion before down command. It felt nice. I tried to bring it to the jury. They said it was a good call, so I thanked them and moved on. I wanted 300, so I called it.
* Third: 300 kg- missed. Didn't move. I was fried. Had to hop off the platform because of my knee. 

**Thoughts**

Bombed out. My parents were in town. Girlfriend made it. Handler was great. A couple other friends were able to come down. I would have loved a shot at 700kg but it wasn't there. There's a lot that would have been nice, but I train to train. I compete for the social aspect and to have something to train for sometimes. I don't care so much to build totals but to push myself, and if that means missing more than I'd like, then it does. I'm happy with that. I give it my all, and sometimes it just isn't there. 

It wasn't a great meet but I tied PR on squat and bench and narrowly missed a 17.5kg PR on deads. Prep wasn't good. I need a break from meet prep and from thinking about competing. I'll cut and hopefully get healthy soon. As far as programming, I will go back to doing my own from scratch as that's what has worked best for me in the past. Nothing wrong with TSA's program. It just wasn't what I needed programming wise, but the back work every day was huge and I'll definitely work on leaning more towards that. 

Thanks for reading!

"**TLDR: Went 8/9 with a 557.5Kg/1229lb total in my first meet since October 2019 with PRs on my Squat, Deadlift, and Total.**

[Video of my best made attempts here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXHy3PFN6AZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

**Background**

[Write-up from my last meet in May October 2019.](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/dhuxyy/meet_report_rps_powermania_louisville_ky_m27_raw/)

This was my 5th meet overall but first in over 2 year. I'll try to keep the background brief:

* After my last meet, I essentially stopped squatting and deadlifting (aside from light RDLs) for a couple months to let whatever glute strain I had actually heal. I slowly starting working them back in to training in early 2020 just in time for everything to close down!
* I didn't have a home gym during lockdown, so I tried to make-do with bodyweight movements and band stuff; but I didn't really stick with it. I did have a 16kg kettlebell, so I chose to complete Dan John's 10,000 swing challenge. 16kg may have been a little light, but I made it work (I think this challenge actually helped improve my hinge ability despite being away from a barbell for a few months).
* I also took the opportunity to go on a cut during this time. From April to early July 2020, I dropped from 178lb to 155lb. Since then, I've been slowly bulking back up.
* In May 2020, I started running thanks to seeing /u/dadliftsnruns post about his training to get to a sub 5-minute mile and a 6 plate deadlift. Before this, I had never actually run a mile continuously, and now I'm pretty consistently getting 20 miles per week (weather permitting). My biggest accomplishment here is running a half marathon in ~2:07:25 in March 2021 (not like an official one; just 13.1 miles around my neighborhood).
* Gyms opened back up in June 2020, and I started with a brief 3-week cycle of 5/3/1 BBB to get re-acquainted with the main lifts before jumping into to Greg Nuckols Stronger by Science Hypertrophy program. I ran two full 21 week cycles of that and then switched to the ""Reps to Failure"" version of the SBS strength program. I essentially ran 1.5 cycles of that into this meet (one full 21 week cycle followed by 12 weeks of a second cycle).
* Turns out having good cardio helps with your conditioning! Also, I think I could literally run either the hypertrophy or RTF templates of the SBS program indefinitely because I enjoy the training style so much! I highly recommend them.
* I also bought a house and got engaged during this time, both of which are pretty cool things I think.

**Meet Prep**

I decided to train like normal going into the meet rather than trying to peak for it. Since it had been so long since my last meet, my main goal was to just get back on the platform and hit some PRs that I knew I was capable of. I wanted to pull 500lb+ in a meet since I had come so close to doing so before. Back in August, I pulled 500lb conventional, so I was very confident in this goal because my sumo is stronger and all of my training indicated I should be capable of at least ~525lb. For squat, my most recent PR was 197.5kg in August, so naturally my goal was to get this to 200kg, which also seemed doable. Going into the meet, I signed up for the 82.5kg class and weighed in at 76.0kg. While I easily could've gone down a class, I knew going in that I wasn't winning either class or breaking a record in either; so I just left myself room to not stress about anything.

**Meet Day**

This meet was at Everyday Athletes in Louisville, KY, which is the gym I go to. Apparently, this was the largest powerlifting meet in Kentucky history since there was like 130 lifters or so. At least 30 - 40 of us were EA members; so it made for an amazing atmosphere. The gym owner even bought all of us shirts to wear for it for free! There were two platforms (Blue and Red), and each platform had four flights of lifters. For the day, I would be in the fourth flight on the blue platform along with around 5 other EA members, which made warmups easy.

**Squats**

My last four meets were either in 100% Raw or RPS, so this was my first time actually getting to wear sleeves for competition!

* [1st Attempt: 180 kg / 397 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMMqu4Ow7VULszqZ_-ZV4S5rxUrr-kDE/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Took a little while to get the start command. According to the head judge, something was up with the gear on the lifter before me? Luckily it didn't make the lift hard, and he said he'd make sure to give a quicker start command on the next attempts.

* [2nd Attempt: 190 Kg / 419 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHALra4FIf_wLhuyZQyRkJmRf59WaNXv/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Got a faster start command this time! Felt the same as the opener, just slightly slower.

* [3rd Attempt: 200 kg / 441 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEwESDhTr1OOhdRf1xzr3-McXCsSxxFc/view?usp=sharing) - Good. A 7.5 kg meet PR, and a 2.5kg personal PR. Felt just like the other attempts, just slower. I felt completely confident going into this since I was able to stay out of my own head!

**Bench**

So, everyone in our flight finished warmups and was ready to go when we were told the judges would go on a 5 minute break after flight C. They only had a handful of lifters to go, so that didn't seem like a big deal. However, the break went on for what felt like 20 minutes, so we were getting pretty antsy to start. I'm not sure how, but I wish they could have communicated this a little better so we could've adjusted our warmups.

* [1st Attempt: 115 kg / 254 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3ppYoppMc2sViceakRzc56diiD8rozW/view?usp=sharing) - Good. If the unexpected break wasn't enough, it felt like we were getting a long pause command.

* [2nd Attempt: 120 Kg / 264 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0zTpDyCfNCuOzhEXETFYL6ViVKAgKYw/view?usp=sharing) - Good. I got on red light from a side judge. I assume it was from lifting my butt up since it sounded like they were being pretty strict with that according to other lifters. Still got two whites though.

* [3rd Attempt: 125 kg / 275 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1naA4gDXQFvvg1t-QIfdN1bV21gCWFWZT/view?usp=sharing) - Miss. Didn't feel too bad on the way down, but I just hit a brick wall on the way up. I don't remember shaking like I did on the video either. Probably should've taken a smaller jump, but I'm not confident 122.5kg would've been there either. Bench is definitely a weak point that I need to badly address going forward!

**Deadlift**

This is what I came here for!

* [1st Attempt: 215 kg / 474 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1na0Nj3AEnogsHI4jJuCBL0w-Y9oVhHWy/view?usp=sharing) - Good.

* [2nd Attempt: 227.5 kg / 501 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_RzB_qq4B2yrcoe5Aw51SF1rNuXZGCj/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Goal accomplished and a 7.5kg meet PR! 

* [3rd Attempt: 237.5 kg / 524 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXQ5UK3Yg7KvlTOrrpOcxC13yUZQIk5N/view?usp=sharing) - Good. 17.5kg meet PR and a 10kg personal PR! Looked like it moved in slow motion, but it was smooth all the way up.

**Summary**

I went 8/9 with a 557.5 kg / 1229 lb total, and PR'd my squat, deadlift, and total! I've competed at EA before, but the atmosphere was nowhere like it was this time with so many members also competing. Seeing everyone else hyped and hitting PRs made the day even better.

Next week I'm starting the Unity program from John Meadows and Dave Tate. I've been wanting to try out some of John's bodybuilding style training since I need to get bigger. Plus, this also give me some exposure to conjugate style training, or at least conjugate with training wheels. After that, I might try out a run of nsuns or something for a while before hopping back on SBS. My main goal for next year is to drive my bench up as much as I can, so gaining weight will definitely help with that. As far as competing, I'm not sure when my next comp will be. I think I'm going to try a novice strongman show sometime early next year to see what that's like.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Preface - everything was in lbs for this meet, sorry in advance. :)

This was my first official meet. Previously I competed in an informal virtual meet in July of 2021. I've been lifting seriously since November 2020, having done Stronglifts and various other linear programs before that without a lot of continuous focus.

I started with 531 last November, and switched to a peaking program for the July meet. Towards the end of that peak, I decided to hire an online-focused coach. I settled on  [/u/tweezy2eezy](https://www.reddit.com/u/tweezy2eezy/) / [@tweezy2eezy](https://www.instagram.com/tweezy2eezy/) and reached out. Antjuan has a >2k total under his belt and is super level-headed about training while still pushing hard. The coaching has been absolutely excellent - since that virtual meet, I've put 100lbs on my total, particularly growing like crazy on deadlifts, which is what I wanted!

If you're looking for virtual training, check Antjuan out here - [http://buffbarbell.com/](http://buffbarbell.com/) - it's super smooth.

**Background and Training:**

I played some sports in middle and beginning of high school, but dropped off for many years after that. I got back into some lifting in college, but never enough to call it a program. Last year, my wife and I built a house with a dedicated room for a home gym in the basement, so I decided to make the most of that commitment and built out my home gym.

Antjuan helped shape programming for my specific weaknesses, and responded no matter what within a day of sending lifts. He found inconsistencies and hammered them from day one.

**Lead Up to the Meet:**

My goal for the meet was 1200lb total, which would have been a 150lb increase. I wasn't trying to gain any weight - I gained about 9lbs, but most of that is probably because I didn't have a lot of discipline on the diet side of things; I could probably have seen the same gains with much less weight increase.

Antjuan's programming is definitely focused on competition readiness and fatigue reduction towards the end, with the final week or so really cutting back and focusing on ""eat and be merry.""

I didn't know what to expect necessarily going into my first meet. Antjuan helped me understand how some parts would go; every fed is different. SPF specifically has monos, for example, so I trained with monos in the last 4-5 weeks.

**Meet Day:**

I arrived early enough to weigh-in. Since I'm not trying to hit any specific weight goal, I didn't do a 24-hour weigh-in; instead I focused on getting good rest and not changing diet up too much.

Speaking of diet - my food intake for the day consisted primarily of low-sugar carbs. Four sandwiches (using white bread to avoid too much fiber intake), some sour patch kids, definitely a good amount of Legion preworkout, shortbread cookies, Gatorade, a few small Reese's, Gatorade energy chews, and some fig newtons. It's still a decent amount of sugar, I would probably cut that down in the future.

[Videos of Lifts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXb0NUqJzD_/?utm_medium=copy_link)

**Squats (2/3 405/430/450):**

Squats went great. I went in a little spooked - if you miss all three lifts on any given lift, you can't continue with the competition. I've had days where 405 just didn't want to move, but meet day it moved fine.

430 moved like a 9-9.5 - we chose 450 as a middle-road. Almost had it, lost some torso tightness.

As a sidenote, timing at meets is the hardest part for me. At home, I can just lift when I'm hyped and ready. At a meet, you have to time your hype just right, or else you'll come down too fast. The mental side at the meet was the hardest part for me.

**Bench (2/3 220/245/270):**

First two attempts went up no problem, third attempt got stuck in the hole. Bench has been the slowest mover for me, so we're going to be working from the pins in the ""off-season.""

**Deadlifts (2/3 440/475/500):**

I wanted 500 really badly, in retrospect I probably should have chosen 490 or so. First two went up fine, totally gassed out on 500; however, it did come up off the floor. I fully expect to pull 500 in the next month.

**Results and Plans Going Forward:**

6 of 9 is not what anyone shoots for, but 100lbs on my total is great progress. My goals are to become stronger, not to win every competition I'm in. That said, even with the misses, I walked away with the first place trophy in my weight class. While this is just a fun regional meet and nothing super serious, it really gives me the motivational fuel after a year or so to keep going and stay committed.

Definitely going to stick with Antjuan with this rate of progress - excited to see how things go from here, and some variety in off-season to work on weak spots. Looking forward to about 6mo of prep before my next shot on the platform!","powerlifting, fitness"
"My First meet on r/Powerlifting and hopefully ill get a nice little flair along with it, despite an interesting final week of prep.

SO BASICALLY, I focused on improving my squat, since I hadn't lifted through the second half of lockdown at all, and it was my favourite lift beforehand. 5 months ago I struggled with 170-180 and couldn't seem to relearn how to brace, as I had just started training again after a long lay-off. Flash back to 12 weeks of training, I did a mock meet and hit a 10kg PB of 210kg along with 135/220, fairly smoothly @ 85kg, so things were looking up. Ran a similar 8-9 week training cycle again and hit 220 for a cool third in competition at a lighter bodyweight. Still Buzzing.

Bench press was a royal cock-up, as I should have been conservative and taken a 135-137.5 in the meet, but jumped up to 140 because I got greedy. Was close because I failed it halfway, but there's no use in leaving kilos on the platform, so ill take smaller jumps next time.

In terms of deadlift, I got stronger, but had grip issues in my mock meet 9 weeks out where I couldn't hold onto 240 despite it moving fairly comfortably. Flash forward to meet time, I was feeling very confident in it for a second attempt, especially after SMOKING a 220 opener. I had done every single set in prep with a mixed grip, holding it further in my palm to prevent the bar from slipping (as I used to use a fingertip grip that was unreliable for me personally).

When it came time for a second deadlift, 240 moved extremely easy. And then my pec cramped.

\--------------------------------------------------------

What I should mention, is that I was planning on water cutting to 83 so that I could quite comfortably hit a QT for nationals, but had gotten ill a few days before, and was absolutely drained. I abandoned my water cut and STILL ended up dehydrated and more down in weight than I expected (because of the residual effects from a water cut combined with the effects of having a cold). So thats why im coming in at such an awkward bodyweight - I normally sit around 87-88 and am planning to just compete in the 93s next time.

\--------------------------------------------------------

My pec hurt so much that I thought I tore something, but checked ROM and it seemed to have no loss of function so I concluded it was fine, and tried again on my 3rd attempt. Hamstring Cramped halfway through the lift. I dropped the bar, did a weird hamstring jig whilst trying not to fall over, laughed, limped off the platform and sat down, confused at the end to the day, and slightly annoyed that my total got nerfed by being dehydrated. 

My hamstring still feels funny half a week later, but I can sort that out with some cheeky prehab. Thanks for reading!

tldr - 220/132.5/220 @ 84.2 some huge meet PRs, but very far from my best day :')","powerlifting, fitness"
"My 2nd meet ever and I was very excited to try and qualify for Canadian Nationals. A Master II 105kg qualifying total is 502.5kg and in my first meet 2 months ago in September I pulled 500kg with some beginner mistakes (locked knees/elbows anybody?) ;)

Only 2 flights in my time slot with 8 and 9 lifters respectively so it went by very quickly. In some cases I was handing in my attempt card, walking back in and back in the hole. I needed to hydrate more but didn't want to risk puking up a bunch of Gatorade on a big lift :)

Squats - original planned attempts were 180/190/200 but my left calf and right knee were giving me some issues so I decided to start at 175 and go from there

First lift (175kg) - no issues. Up like a starter should. 3 white lights

Second lift (185kg) - Had to grind a bit and my knee started to protest but the lift went up. 3 white lights

Third lift (190kg) - A grind but I may have been being a bit cautious. I think I had a bit more in me but glad I played it safe. Personal PR of 10lbs. 3 white lights

Bench - Original planned attempts were 115/125/130

First attempt (115kg) - Now my calves were starting to cramp so getting set was tough. I'm going to start setting my feet first for bench then getting my shoulders down. On the first lift my left foot slipped which is why it looks so awkward and an auto 'no lift'

Second attempt (120kg) - I knew strength wasn't the issue but didn't want to bomb out so settled on a 5kg jump. Was able to get setup better this time and it went up like it should. 3 white lights.

Third attempt (125kg) - My calves were finally cooperating and like the 2nd attempt my setup was better so the lift was a lot smoother. Except I rolled ever so slightly on my left foot so got one red light. Didn't get it on video but that's a meet PR

Deadlifts - Original planned attempts - 200/215/225

First attempt (200kg) - went up very smoothly and felt great. 3 white lights

Second attempt (215kg) - here's where the speed of the event started to play in. Other guys were making bigger jumps so it got in my head how quickly I had to lift again. Went up but it felt like a real grind. Still, 3 white lights and a meet PR

Third attempt (220kg) - No excuses - I lost my focus, didn't brace, and basically blew it. My biggest disappointment of the night for sure.

But a 530kg total is a meet PR and qualifies me for Canadian Nationals. Overall, I was pretty happy, especially as this was only my 2nd meet. Placed 2nd of three competitors too. Was nice to have other people to compete against this time and everybody was ultra supportive of each other!

\*\*Overview\*\*

This last weekend I Competed at my 11th powerlifting meet and totalled 907.5kg at 147kg bodyweight and achieved my lifetime goal of totalling 2,000 pounds in sleeves. My first competition was in 2013 where I hit a 535kg total in the 110kg weight class, and in the 8 years since then I’ve added 372.5kg to my total, or around 46.5kg a year for 8 years (not how it broke down but a fun statistic nonetheless). I’m going to use this meet report as a bit of manifesto writeup on the all the things I’ve learned these last 2 years since my last competition and what I felt really made realizing this goal possible. \[So if you just want to see the lifts here you go\]([https://www.instagram.com/daveatops/](https://www.instagram.com/daveatops/))

The first thing I wanted to talk about in this post is setting big goals and what it feels like for me to have achieved something I’ve been working for since I started powerlifting 8 years ago. Almost immediately into starting powerlifting I decided that I wanted to hit a 2k in sleeves and that I didn’t care at what weight class it happened just that I could do it. I was 24 years old at my first meet and had already been training in the weight room for years and through my time in the Marine Corps had experienced life at a variety of weights on my 6’1 frame (my lowest in boot camp was 169lbs and my highest in service was 255lbs). I knew that if I could continue to eat and put on weight, that I should be able to continuously get stronger over the years and begin to hit peak strength at the 10-year mark (around 34-35). 4 years later from my first meet I had grown into the 140kg weight class from 110kg and put 265kg on my total. This led to my first attempt at a 2k total at IPL World’s in 2017. There I tore my quad on my opening squat at 302.5kg and I spent the rest of 2018 rehabbing that quad and eventually hitting a 852.5kg total after working with Trevor Jaffe. Prior to today that had been my highest total as I dropped my deadlift on 2nd attempts at my following meet in 2019. So, I knew the next time I competed I wanted to have 2k in the pocket and not have any doubts about dropping a deadlift. On meet day I found myself in a fantastic place between confident and excited and really just go to focus on executing my lifts to the best of my ability. When I finally stepped up for my 2nd deadlift to seal the deal on 2k I knew it was there and held it at the top for a bit to really savor the feeling. I looked out on a sea of my friends and family wearing #Dave2k shirts and just had the greatest feeling of pride and accomplishment wash over me. I’ve been smiling ever since Saturday and really don’t plan to ever stop. I was worried that as soon as I hit it I’d be thinking about the next total but really I feel massive contentment and happiness hitting this goal and being able to appreciate all of the work, education, pain, and sacrifice of the last 8 years to finally realize this dream total. It feels like an enormous burden lifted off my body and that I feel free to revel in it. So my advice for younger lifters is to not sell yourself short but commit to realizing your competitive dreams and make that dream so high and difficult that when you finally hit it you can appreciate having finished the race and where you placed, and not be immediately overcome by feelings of more more more. 

\*\*Training\*\*

I came up with a 2-year linear progression and velocity regulated training plan that consisted of training 2 days a week (which had worked well besides the bar drops in my 2019 meet) that would have me deadlifting the first day and then squatting and benching the 2nd day. My previous meet prep had been successful with 2 days a week and I didn’t want to deviate from a plan I knew that I could stick to regardless of my doctoral schoolwork or family life schedule. I also knew that I would have to lift big PRs in the gym that I had never hit on the platform and needed a way to progress up to those loads safely over time. What I wanted to achieve was maximum momentum building of progressing either a set, a rep, or weight every week back-to-back for as long as possible without deloading. I started at very easy and doable weights which was 585 for squat and deadlift, and 405 for bench. For squat and deadlift I would progress from one top single followed by a back off variation (hi bar pause for squat and deficit or snatch grip for dl) to a top triple. Once I hit the weight for 3 reps I would add 20lbs and repeat the progression. If there were weeks where I couldn’t add a rep I would add a set. This got me to around the 655 mark on squat and the 675 mark on deadlift. For bench I started with my old progression of turning 405 for 5 sets of 1 into a 5x5 over 5 weeks, add 10lbs, and repeat until I couldn’t do 5 reps, then drop the rep target down to 3 reps and repeat. This prep I hit 475 for a triple, and 485 for doubles which were big PRs with a rep or two left in the tank still. 

Eventually I found I couldn’t add the reps that I wanted on squat and deadlift and moved to performing a top single followed by back offs. These singles started around the 655 mark for squat and deadlift, and ended at 722 for squat and deadlift at 3 weeks out. The way I built progression into these was if I didn’t add weight to the top single the following week I would add a rep or a set to the back off work. After a period of 3-6 weeks doing that I would eventually be able to progress up the top single. By the end of this meet prep I had 16 weeks squatting above 705 and over 12 weeks above 705 on deadlift, this greatly boosted my confidence that these numbers would be there on meet day and that I would be strong enough to hit my goal total. The only draw back on this training was the low volume and so I had to make sure I stayed on top of my accessories and did around 3 accessory movements (split squats, cable rows, 1 leg glute bridges, kb swings, amrap pushups, bottoms up kb press, and db bench being the main ones) on each training day for 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps. Weeks I skipped accessories eventually led to either stallouts or deloads but when I stayed on top of my accessories there was always a progression available on the following week. 

In regards to bar speed I knew that once I started grinding reps I had very little room to improve the following week. That’s why I started so light and gave myself the time to build up into the heavy poundages when it mattered (the last 20 weeks of my training cycle). By keeping the bar speed fast, I was rarely in a position where I couldn’t be fully recovered for the next training day. This high weekly recovery rate allowed me to continuously hit heavy loads without the need for any deloading or wasted training days. It also ensured I didn’t lift too heavy during my peak as I knew what certain weights would move at speed wise and let me pick very accurate testing loads at 3 weeks out. 

To compliment my training, I really began honing my visualization practice and mindfulness training. Each day I spent around 10-15 minutes both doing breath work and visualizing my final competition lifts along with going through dry runs of the lifts in the air without weight and visualizing how I wanted them to move on competition day. This let me get in thousands of repetitions of the movement pattern I wanted to replicate on the platform and prepared my mind greatly for the 2k goal. I credit this training with allowing me to improve each one of my platform lifts to where the 3rd attempt felt the best on both squat and deadlift and my 2nd deadlift was a sealed deal before even picking it up. I could feel where my body was off during the lift and knew exactly what to do to correct it in the moment and prevent it from happening on the following attempt. The work I did on sports psychology I feel really improved my ability to execute at the competition and gave me a ridiculous amount of skill practice over the years to draw upon for making in the moment corrections.

Finally, to compliment my high recovery training plan I finally got my nutrition dialed in to compliment my already insanely anal sleep schedule. For a long time, I tried to be strong despite my nutrition and finally following the examples of my lifters I began to cook the actual amount of protein I needed a day, talk to my wife and create an eating plan that would be separate from her and my son (we’re all much happier), and aim to have a consistent eating schedule that I could maintain while travelling (which I actually did and am super proud of). I’m really glad I gave up being stubborn here and just embraced the full process. In cases where I forgot to food prep or cook I made my wallet hurt and ordered food that hit what I needed for the day. Typically a few days of lazy ordering out was enough to snap me out of my lack of wanting to meal prep and I would be good for another couple weeks. Most days I would have 2 10 oz ny strips, 4-5 cups of rice, 3-5 eggs, 1 cup of shredded cheese, 8 oz of smoked sausage (or 6 strips of thick cut bacon), 2-3 50g METRX canned protein shakes, an Athletic Greens shake, and a giant bowl of honey bunches of oats and chocolate milk. My bodyweight stayed between 315 and 330 for the majority of prep. For sleep because I wake up at 4am for work I made sure to setup my coaching schedule at the gym to morning and an evening time block. So, when the morning ended at 9am I would come home and eat, sleep till 1230, eat when I woke up, and then had back to my 3pm coaching group. So, each day I was able to get at least above 7.5 hours. I really started to feel the momentum of sleep and nutrition at about 12 weeks out and it helped me to stay consistent during the most critical parts of my meet prep.

My best lifts of the prep for squat was a \[705x2\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuE0cXAizV/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuE0cXAizV/)) that I hit in July followed by a \[722 squat at 3 weeks out for my heaviest squat of the prep\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYX6lDDsPL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYX6lDDsPL/)) 

For bench at about 13 weeks out I had a grade 2 tear in my left pec I got on a 485 double. I normally squat first then bench, but wanted to hit a big bench that day without being fatigued for a squat. I went through my warmups too fast and wasn’t warm enough for the lift and felt it tear on the first rep and then more again on the 2nd. I rehabbed that back pretty fast using isometric pin presses and the duffalo bar and ensuring I spent every day putting the pec through ranges of motion it could handle. About 4 weeks later I hit a 470 on the duffalo and felt it was strong enough to start pushing again. This prep I hit a \[500lbs duffalo bench\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUiaDEcDzKe/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUiaDEcDzKe/)), another 485x2 for redemption, and my final heavy bench at 3 weeks out was 505 on a straight bar\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYc6Utjxqd/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYc6Utjxqd/)) where my butt came up and just a general shit show. I still felt relatively confident going into bench because I knew what improvements I could make if I took the time to warmup and setup correctly and not just lay down on the bench and press like a lazy shw. 

For deadlift this prep my biggest point of focus was getting used to kilo plates and getting as many 700+ pulls in as a I could where my grip was secure at the top. I hit a \[683 off a deficit\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUa\_Vi1Db4Y/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUa_Vi1Db4Y/)), a \[705x2 dl with kilos\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUIvrW-BhUf/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUIvrW-BhUf/)), and a heaviest pull of \[722 at 3 weeks out\]( [https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRA0w6DKi7/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRA0w6DKi7/)). 

\*\*Competition\*\*

Chris Bridgeford had originally told me about this competition at the US Open back in April, I was already planning on doing a meet in the November time frame so it ended up working great and I was pumped to be using a mono. I normally walkout my squats and was excited to really learn how to use a mono well with my setup. The week of the competition my wife and I drove down on Thursday afternoon 5.5 hours to Vancouver, WA and met up with my good friend and lifter Nathan Brandhorst and his gf Kayla who’s another one of my lifters. I had 3 lifters competing in this meet alongside me which made it an extra special day to see them all hit very big total PRs (Kayla a 45lb total pr, Dylan a 130lb total pr, Nathan 109lb pr and 2105 sleeve total). Weighed in Friday morning, ate food, hydrated like demons and did mobility work for the rest of the day. I had two lifters come in Friday afternoon and train at Generation Strength while another was doing weigh ins. So I went to coach them for that and hang out and move around some more. 

The crew at Generation Strength is really top notch and something else. The atmosphere they have created there is really a special thing and all of the lifters benefitted from the inaugural WRPF meet in Washington State. We really felt like the superstars that day and the meet was run well, on time, and with great equipment for the lifters to use. 

My plan for the meet was to secure my 2k total by my 2nd deadlift which means I would need a 340kg squat, and anything above a 232.5kg bench. 

\*\*Squat\*\* \[3/3 50lb pr at 749.5\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWBwwkIB3iv/)

Warmups went really well. I brought my tendo unit and was setting velocity prs on every warmup set. Missed the rerack in the mono at 172.5kg but ended up being fine. Last warmup at 285kg moved above a .5 m/s. I’m used to lifting on carpet which I can torque and root into really well. Lifting on rubber was something I knew I would need to be extra anal about with my setup and make sure that I was in the right place before unracking.   
 

Opener at 310kg- had my rack height set one notch too high so was really difficult to unrack at first. Finally got set in the right spot to pop it out but was a little more shakey than I wanted to be. Ended up being deep and fast  
 

2nd at 327.5kg- dropped the mono height down and had an easier time unracking. Bar felt like it rolled down on me a bit on the unrack and ended up fighting it down too much trying to stay balanced. Ended up forward and had to use my low back to save it. Since I knew what I did wrong and that I just needed to stop fighting the bar I made my planned jump to 340kg.  
 

3rd at 340kg- I knew I'd be fine if I just rode the lightning and didn't fight it down. Practiced my position and technique a few times with air squats before my attempt was called and was confident I could lock it in. Walked up to the platform and got set, realized I was a bit too far back and rest and scooted my feet forward. Unracked, stayed over my feet, hinged my hips a hair more and drove the knees forward hard coming down. Hit the hole and felt a tightness above my left knee but kept my midfoot pressure and powered out of the hole hard and fast. When I passed halfway, I knew it was there and immediately started to yell in happiness.

\*\*Bench\*\* \[3/3 and a 11lb bench pr\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWBxkvohrvs/)

Bench warmups went well and I was able to keep my butt down the whole time. Last warmup around 200kg felt really good if just a bit heavy. But I told myself that's OK cuz the sport is lifting heavy things  
 

1st attempt at 220kg- good handout and descent, probably one of my best 485 benches.   
 

2nd attempt at 232.5kg- this matches my bench pr and was what I knew I needed to make 2k even remotely possible. Setup a bit too far back and had to press more straight up than I like.   
 

3rd attempt at 237.5kg- this would tie Nate and put the pressure on him to hit a 3rd bench to beat me. Then I found out he passed and I needed it to tie him and set myself up for the 2k. Setup further down on the pad, got my legs set perfect. Had a perfect handout from one of my lifters who came, Robin, and hit my descent tempo perfect. Had to wait a hair after the press command to come up cuz I wasn't ready and then just slammed on the gas. Felt fantastic.

\*\*Deadlift\*\* \[2/3 33lb PR\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWByjhFBhsJ/) 

Warmups went fantastic. Every set felt better than the last and I was staying consistent with my teknik. Was really excited to hit the platform and secure that total.  
 

Dl opener at 310kg- I was a bit worried about my rooting cuz of the rubber platform and chalk and powder accumulation but just told myself to control what I can control. Smoke show and felt great. Gave me all the confidence in the world for my 2nd.   
 

2nd attempt at 330kg- I'd been visualizing this pull for months and I felt the most perfect combination of excitement and confidence walking up the platform. My good friend JP Price hooked me up with some classic Phil Collins Genesis and I looked out at the sea of #Dave2k shirts my friends were wearing and just knew it was gonna happen. Took my time getting my feet set, got my hands set well, hit my slack pull and stood up. Almost lost my balance at the top from how fast it was moving but stabilized and held on!! 2k total sealed and 8 years of powerlifting progress realized in an instant!  
 

3rd attempt at 340kg- This was my first time in a meet where I could actually pull something that I wanted to and test myself without trying to play catch up or just hold onto the bar. The setup felt good, bar came off the ground well, just didn't have the gas left in my legs to get the knees to lock once it got above. No drops tho!!

8/9 day with a 2000lb total and 121lb total PR at 325lbs. Good for 1st place in SHW and 2nd highest total of the meet and probably around 3rd for Best Lifter behind Nathan Brandhorst and Devon Porter. 

\*\*Plans going forward\*\*

I’ll probably do something like a real heavy bench daddy this week and see if I have enough strength left to go above my current pr at 715. The dl bar took a good bite out of my thumb so no pulling for a week or two. My left knee is sore as crap from squatting so will take a bit of time off there until the range of motion comes back. Mostly will just be some messing around and having fun for the rest of the year. 

Things I want to work on and improve for next time are adding in some sheiko pulls to my deadlift training before my top single to really seal in my Teknik with the kilo plates. For squat I’ll continue my normal training plan of a top single/double/triple and back off hi bar pause work after and will make use of my duffalo bar. For bench I’ll have lots of duffalo bar and bench daddy work. I really liked how my body felt paying attention to nutrition so I’ll most likely stay pretty consistent with that as well.

Now that the meet is over and done with my brain is freed up to finish my dissertation study. This has got me the most excited because it allows me to give back to this community that has given me so much over the years. I will be recruiting 10 male and 10 female intermediate powerlifters (dots between 300-399) for 12 weeks of free online coaching where we will be assessing the effects of coach and athlete communication scheduling on lifter mood, motivation, self-efficacy, and the coach-athlete relationship. More details on that recruiting process will be released soon and I’m very excited to be conducting first of its kind research that will go towards benefitting our sport for both the athletes and coaches. Again, I’d like to thank this community for everything I’ve learned here over the years, the friendships I’ve made, and the support that’s been provided here for me. None of this would be possible without the influence of the reddit community of strength athletes and all the knowledge shared here over the years. I sincerely hope that everyone’s big lifelong goals are realized through the lessons we learn and share in this community and the support we have for one another.","powerlifting, fitness"
"I will keep this short because this is my first Meet Report, and I didn't take notes during the event. 

My 12 yo daughter has been training with a coach for about 6 months. 
  
She had her first powerlifting meet last weekend.
 
She had 9 perfect lifts, set PA state records in all 3 lifts (record was previously vacant), and she won a gold medal (no other competitors in her division). 
 
She also met a bunch of other lady lifters, all who treated her so well. 
 
Was a very positive event for her and she is already asking to do another. 
 
I did not record all of her lifts, but her maxes were:
 
Squat: 195 lbs
 
Bench: 110 lbs
 
DL: 215 lbs
 
Total = 520 lbs

"Obviously not nearly as impressive as most meet reports here, but I wanted to share as this was my first ever meet. Roughly 8 months before this meet was the first time I had ever touched a barbell, and prior to that had no real strength training experience besides some rock climbing. I obviously have a long way to go, but happy with my first meet performance!

9/9 Successful Attempts
Squat: 125 kg, 135 kg, 140 kg
Benchpress: 85 kg, 90 kg, 95 kg
Deadlift: 160 kg, 172.5 kg, 180 kg
Total: 415 kg

I didn't really take note of which lifts got red lighted. The only ones I saw were one red light for each side judge on my 2nd and 3rd deadlift attempts.

I didn't go into this meet with many programming adjustments leading up to it or anything. My plan was to simply learn how to compete and I wanted to put up a 400 kg total. I simply cut volume and accessories a week out and focused more on training heavy singles. I did not cut weight at all, as I have been sitting around 72-73 kg comfortably and didn't think that was good idea to do for a first meet either.
Every attempt, with the exception of my 3rd deadlift attempt, was a weight I had done in the gym before. My 3rd squat and benchpress were just under my gym PRs. I didn't want to risk a lot as I had no idea how I would feel or perform on the platform. Happy I picked my attempts safely as that made me go 9/9, but I didn't expect such a surge of adrenaline on every lift. My 3rd deadlift was a ~5 kg PR and every lift felt easy compared to most of the heavy singles I'd done the previous week.
I went into this meet expecting to be super nervous on the platform and unsure what I was supposed to do. Upon arriving, the meet director and team were incredibly helpful and all the lifters were friendly and supportive. The environment was more relaxed than I expected and I had a fantastic experience. Definitely a community I want to be a part of and I look forward to my next meet!","powerlifting, fitness"
"My brother and sister-in-law are getting a gym membership soon and asked me to help them out with programming as neither of them have really lifted before. I'm suggesting for them to start with Greyskull LP for a few months but as we live in different cities, I want to give them resources for learning appropriate form. I'd appreciate if anyone could list any of their go-to/ favorite resources (videos, books, articles) for teaching beginners how to perform the main lifts (BP, OHP, Squat, DL) correctly.","powerlifting, fitness"

"**Background**

I started lifting casually around 2010 and switched to focusing more on powerlifting in 2015. This was  my third meet - in my first meet I totaled 350 kg, in my second meet I got cocky and bombed out on squats, and my third meet was canceled due to COVID. I hadn't competed since 2018 and in that time I moved to a new city, started working with a local coach, and took several months off from lifting due to COVID-related gym closures. This past spring I was really frustrated, having made minimal progress since 2018, and I was starting to feel like maybe my strength had just peaked. I switched to working with an online coach and  a month out from this meet finally hit some gym PRs at a mock meet my gym held to raise money for local organizations. Then two weeks out I strained my back doing paused deadlifts and skipped out on all of my peak week lifts. One week out I failed a 140 kg deadlift (20+ kg below my max). I considered dropping out of the meet but decided to just lower my expectations and put up a total. 

**Squat**

1st attempt - 115 kg/253 lbs - good lift. I bombed out of my last meet on squats for depth so I was super nervous for this, but it moved like an opener should and got 3 whites. 

2nd attempt - 122.5 kg/270 lbs - good lift. This moved fine, again 3 whites. 

3rd attempt - 130 kg/286 lbs - good lift. Decided to go for matching my gym PR and made it! I was thrilled to hit this in a meet and to make it through squats without receiving any reds. 

**Bench**

1st attempt - 70 kg/154 lbs - good lift. I should have asked for a liftoff, and the rack setting was a little high, but this moved fine.

2nd attempt - 75 kg/165 lbs - good lift. Got a liftoff this time and it helped.

3rd attempt - 80 kg/176 lbs - good lift. I'd only hit this touch-and-go before, so I was really happy to hit it here. 

**Deadlift**

1st attempt - 142.5 kg/314 lbs - good lift. I was nervous for this after failing 140 earlier in the week, but warmups moved well and so did this. 

2nd attempt - 155 kg/341 lbs - good lift. Again, pretty nervous, but this moved fine and was pain free. 

3rd attempt - 165 kg/363 lbs - good lift. Decided to go for matching my gym PR. Lost some tightness in my lats but completed the lift. 

Total: 375 kg at 60 kg, went 9/9, matched all my gym PRs.

**Summary**

I'm pretty pleased with how this meet turned out! Adding 25 kg to my total in 3 years isn't great progress, but it's something. All I can do is keep showing up in the gym and putting in the work. This meet was a good confidence boost and a good reminder of how supportive the powerlifting community is/how fun meets are.  I'm ready to keep building - I'd really like to squat 300+ lbs in a meet in 2022!

"So I posted this thread \~3 years ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/atnu7t/top\_powerlifters\_who\_disappeared/](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/atnu7t/top_powerlifters_who_disappeared/)) and it gained quite good traction so why not revisit?

It's a little depressing, but also cool to remember some of the big name lifters out there who only some years ago were all anyone was talking about like a Haack today and now have effectively disappeared.

Of course you can check out the last thread but to throw some names out there -  Derek Kendall, Pozdeev, Belyaev, Malanichev, Vince Urbank, Kade Weber, Jamie Lewis, George Leeman, Eric Spoto, Jeremy Hamilton and many more.

Also, partly why I thought to re-do this thread, RIP Chris Hickson who passed away recently.

I'll kick off - at one time Derek Kendall was an absolute monster and then he just sort of disappeared. Dude was squatting like 900, front squatting 800, pulling 8-900. Just massive numbers (I could be slightly misremembering).","powerlifting, fitness"
"This was my first meet. I started lifting 2 years ago with the goal of just seeing how strong I could get if I just showed up to the gym every day and did the work. My goal for the meet was just to do the meet and if the weight was moving I was hoping to break a 1100 pounds. 

Squat - I opened at 363 lbs. I knew I could hit this on a bad day. I’m glad I chose it because I toon a narrow stance at the monolift, got nervous, and just took the squat super narrow. Still got 3 white lights. And that set my mood for the day. I hit 374 lbs with three white lights for my second attempt. I got a personal best of 402 lbs for my final attempt with three white lights. 

Bench - I was nervous about the commands so I had been training with a 2-3 second pause. The judge was much kinder to me. I got my first two attempts of 242 lbs and 259 lbs easily. Then I tried 275 lbs and got stuck a couple inches off the chest. 

Deadlift - Deadlift was going great in training. I got all three of my lifts here at 418 lbs, 440 lbs, and 451.

I came in dead last in my weight class lol. But I’m so fired up and excited about this sport. I know I have a lot more capacity and can’t wait to see where my training takes me this year.

This program is one of the many programs translated from Boris Sheiko’s book. It endures 4 weeks, and it requires you to go 3 days each week.

It’s mainly for increasing SBD, hence why you do at least 2 compounds each day. There’s about 2 accessories each day such as Good Mornings and Flies; 3 accessories if you’re lucky

Program experience:

As someone who’s never attempted a program before hand, the volume was gruelling. 

My experience with the program was enjoyable, since I was able to gain somewhat a decent amount on SBD, but I don’t know whether that’s to me training properly for the first time or newbie gains. 

SBD experience:

I was only doing deadlift variations ( Rack pulls, Deadlifts to knees) once a week , but it still somehow improved my deadlift overall.T his claims to be a ‘beginner’ program, yet it doesn’t state a warning about hamstring cramps, so be wary for that. 

With squats, I was very pleased. The reason it took me so long to do some type of program was due to my ankle mobility on squats , which took quite a while too fix. Squatting 3 times a week was rough though ( 2 sets on 1 day during the week) was a shift and a half. But clearly the shift came with a good cheque, so like I said; PLEASED.

Bench was not intense whatsoever, so I’d recommend to anyone to put your bench on the program about 5-10lbs up. My bench did improve but the working sets didn’t not feel as demanding as the other ones.

During the 4 weeks, squats I failed , deadlift I failed , but not a single bench was failed, so I suggest increasing the bench 1RM

Diet and sleep:

Also, I wasn’t to state my sleep was about 5 hours and diet was very off, where most days I didn’t reach my protein intake, so you could expect greater results.","powerlifting, fitness"
"**PREP**  
This was my 5th meet, with the first being February 2018.  
Started this meet prep a week after a July 24th meet, and knew i wanted to use the 3 months to do strength/ ""re peak"" rather than try and fit a lot of volume in after having done a lot of that leading up to the first meet.  
I knew i needed to manage fatigue from the start to be able to push DL the way i wanted to.  
Two times per week squat w/ top single and 3X5 or 5X3, then repeating just the single day 2.  
I adapted the template from Gillinghams 12 week heavy/light bench program for this,  which waves the loading three times in 12 weeks, and i used just the heavy day 2X week in the manner described above.  
I left a few weeks just for singles practice at the end.  
For DL i did SSPT style singles only on a twice a week scheme, repeating the first few weeks twice each to fit the calendar and have last heavy pulls Wednesday the week before meet week.  
I use an inflated e1RM when i do all singles, so the repeated early weeks were useful to get some volume in before things got heavier.  
Bench programming remained unchanged.

**MEET**

A few weeks out i found out the meet would be an AM session.  
It was a 2 hour drive for me for 8 am weigh ins, so i started shifting my eating and sleeping patterns earlier, and that worked out fairly well.  
Got about 8 hours sleep Thursday night, and managed 3.5 the night before the meet.  
Weighed in at 91.5kg

**SQUAT**

ATTEMPT 1: 177.5kg/391.3lb  
Was pleased to move my opener up 2.5kg from last meet.  
Squat looked good, but i could feel i was on my toes some.  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 187.5kg/413.4lb  
This was my third in July, and the current state record for M3a\~93kg  
Little slowing mid ascent.   
Form held.  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 190kg/418.9lb  
192.5kg would have been an outright PR, but i had decided to stick to my script, as i had a specific total target which i will explan at the end.  
This moved better than either of my other attempts, with almost no discernible slowing.  
Funny how that goes.  
Three whites

**BENCH PRESS**

ATTEMPT 1: 107.5kg/237lb  
This was also 2.5kg up from my July opener  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 112.5kg/248lb  
This was my third in July  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 115kg/253.5lb  
Meet best, but not the 117.5kg i had hit well paused in training.  
I subsequently failed 117.5kg in training, and knocked all my meet attempts back based on that.  
I wanted a new meet best, and needed the kgs for my total target.  
It was the right call, as my left arm stalled for a moment on the press.  
No downward movement though.  
Three whites.  
117.5kg is the Masters 3/93kg state record, so 120kg is my target for next meet.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 205kg/451.9lb  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 220kg/485lb  
New state record by 5kg  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 222.5kg/490.5lb  
I had wanted my 227.5 kg for this meet, but had already decided not to attempt it.  
Right side lagged very slightly off the floor, but otherwise the lift looked way easier than it felt.  
Looking at it you might think 227.5 was there, but i'm not so sure.  
Three whites.

**RESULTS**  
27 white lights  
Meet best squat for new state record  
Meet best bench  
New all time PR deadlift for new state record  
New state record total with 527.5kg  
That total is #11 all years USAPL for M3a\~93kg Raw  
I would have needed 535kg for #10, and that was just too much risk with my bench being what it was, and a big unknown for a 227.5kg pull.  
What i did meet day was exactly what i had planned.  
Very pleased with the outcome.

**WHAT'S NEXT**  
I'm taking the week off, and resume training Saturday with my same bench program.  
The following Wednesday i start deadlift on a twice a week 3 week micro used in 9 week blocks.  
Planning on a new 5lb single PR every block as a submax pull.  
Plan on 3 blocks to end at 505lbs with a lot of volume backing that up for whenever the peak comes.  
I would most prefer a very late summer 2022 or even late fall 2022 meet this time around.  
I will be doing some sort of maintenance of squat for at least a few weeks to a month.  
Probably just a single twice a week until i feel out how the new deadlift program feels.

**Carrie Boudreau Big Pullooza Powerlifting Championships**

This meet was organised in honor of the memory of Carrie Boudreau, a multiple time world champion, world record holder, and (iirc) the first woman to deadlift 4 times bodyweight in competition.  
She was from here in Maine.   
There is much more to her story, but her friend and co competitor Shelby Downing has stared this annual meet so that more people can begin to become aware of who Carrie was, and her accomplishments in powerlifting, and in life.

"**PREP**

I took a 32 week break between my last competition in March and this one. I wanted to build a fair amount of muscle to hopefully have that translate to a bigger total, so my coach /u/agent21emh came up with a number of training blocks that included a lot of hypertrophy work that I believe paid off immensely when it came time to peak. Our main goal coming into this competition was a 635 kg/1400 lbs total, and we went through a ton of back and forth/discussion about how we would get there. He is a great coach and I'm lucky to work with him and call him a friend.

**MEET**

Used the water cut guide from /u/rawrylynch (https://sisyphusstrength.com/blog/2018/6/25/how-to-water-cut-like-a-pro) to manipulate my water/sodium levels to cut from 85.2kg/188 lbs, and ended up weighing in at 82.0kg/180.8 lbs. This was interesting to me because I had cut from a lower beginning bodyweight last competition, and weighed in heavier. I woke up at 82.3kg/181.5 lbs, and weigh in for my session was at 1:30 PM, so I was able to have 24 ounces of gatorade and some rice crispy treats before I weighed in, and still ended up very light. Next competition, I will begin my cut with a beginning bodyweight closer to 86.2kg/190 lbs.

**SQUAT** 

ATTEMPT 1: 210kg/463 lbs 

https://streamable.com/8wyoyp

This was my first competition after making the transition to low-bar squatting. Obviously it was uncomfortable at first, but thanks to the long break between competitions, my body was able to make the necessary adaptations and respond accordingly. The first squat for me is always the hardest and moves the worst. I was happy to get this on the board and move forward. Good lift

ATTEMPT 2: 220kg/485 lbs

https://streamable.com/psc4rh

This was a 2.5kg/6 lbs all time PR. Erik and I had spoken about attempt selection for this competition, and decided on taking a PR for my 2nd based on how my last heavy squat of 215kg/474 lbs during prep moved. This lift felt very easy and moved relatively well. This squat meant a lot to me, it was my first squat PR since July 2020, over 15 months ago. After a brief discussion, we decided to go with the heavier planned 3rd. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 227.5kg/501 lbs

https://streamable.com/ae5sfg

This is a 10kg all time PR (best coming in to the meet was 217.5kg/479 lbs). Can't really describe my mindset going in to this lift, but I was beyond focused for it. This is the most weight I've ever attempted, and honestly after seeing the video I may have had another 5kg. Our original plan for this attempt before the competition was a top end of222.5kg/ 492 lbs, but after discussion we decided to have this weight be the top end, and that ended up making all of the difference for my total. Feels kind of cool to break a big barrier of a 500 pound squat. Good lift.

**BENCH PRESS** 

ATTEMPT 1: 147.5kg/325 lbs

https://streamable.com/za4qri

Bench press had been moving and feeling incredibly well this prep. I was able to hit an all time PR in training during my last heavy session (with that being 157.5kg/347 lbs). The transition to low-bar squatting had caused me to suffer from some bicep pain during training, but it would almost always dissipate shortly after and not affect my strength too much. Good lift here

ATTEMPT 2: 155kg/342 lbs

https://streamable.com/5gpicu

I was hoping that this would move insane so I could convince Erik to let me take a moonshot at 165kg/363 lbs for my third attempt so I could achieve a 2x BW bench in comp, but sadly this actually felt kind of difficult so I didn't even bring it up and we stuck with our plan for the 3rd. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 160kg/353 lbs

https://streamable.com/pqs27i

2.5kg/6 lbs all time PR, and a 5kg/11 lbs competition PR. Honestly not a ton to say about this lift. Erik made the right call and this was probably the most I had on the day. Not quite 2x BW yet, but still cool to break a 350+ pound bench in competition and have a good contribution to my total. Good lift.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 232.5kg/513 lbs

https://streamable.com/pq2ey9

This was a weight that both Erik and I knew I could nail in my sleep, and it moved and felt pretty well. Good lift.

ATTEMPT 2: 245kg/545 lbs

https://streamable.com/fkhwh2

This was actually the largest jump I've ever taken in competition. Our plan ended up working out well, I was able to go 6/6 on my Squat and bench, PR both, and then secure the 635 kg/1400 lbs total on my 2nd deadlift, so that I could take whatever was there on the day for my 3rd. Felt very nice to break my 3rd big milestone of the day, this one being the most important to me. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 255kg/562 lbs

https://streamable.com/6ykrbv

In hindsight, I should've been more vocal about how I was feeling and dropped this to 252.5 kg/556 lbs. It would've been nice to PR all of my lifts and my total, but you live and you learn. While it's possible I have the strength to hit this weight when I'm fresh, my grip did not hold up and that's something I will havwe to work on moving forward. No lift, but my spirits were not broken as I had achieved the primary goal of the day already.

**RESULTS**

Was able to PR my squat, bench press, and total by 10kg/22 lbs, 5kg/11 lbs, and 15kg/33lbs respectively. There are some incredibly strong lifters in the northeast, and I did not go in to this competition expecting to win my division or even place. I ended up 7th in the 83kg division and was able to see some really strong individuals put on incredible performances, and I hope to be in their shoes one day. But I was able to hit my main goal of a 1400 pound total, and maybe had another 5kg on squat, and 5kg on deadlift, so I am very happy with that.
 

**WHAT'S NEXT**

This meet happened last weekend, I just took a week off and vacationed in Miami, but I will be back on program and diet tomorrow to continue building my total as best as I can. I am directing a competition on January 8th and then again in March, so I will probably look for a competition during summer 2022 to make sure I can keep my priorities straight.","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Prep/Background**

This was my 12th overall powerlifting meet with a BOMB and a bunch of tiny 100% RAW meets peppered throughout. For the past ~2 years I've lifted out of an incredible gym in Louisville, KY called Everyday Athletes, where I've been coached by the owner, Chance Cianciola. He typically has me running 3 week mesocycles, with one squat, one deadlift, and two bench days per week. Nothing flashy with his programming, but he does an excellent job of targeting my weak points, listening to my issues, and making things as fun as possible. The overall training cycle this go around overall went really smooth, despite dealing with pneumonia, a new job, a toddler, and pregnant wife. Easily the best I've felt leading into a meet ever

**Meet Day**

The meet was held at Fit4Life 24|7 in Frankfort, which is a *huge* gym with lots of cool stuff, and its really centrally located around a lot of restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores, which was super convenient. In the past I've done a godawful job of eating and taking care of myself on meet day, and it's shown with my piss poor deadlift performance last meet. I made a very conscious effort to eat, basically all day long. Lots of oatmeal, bagels, apples, Qdoba, pretzels, basically anything I know my body likes. I also scaled *way* back on the caffeine and stimulants. Very successful there. 

**SQUAT**

I like squatting, squatting is my favorite

1: Opened at 265kg/584.3lbs. Shit. Flew. GOOD LIFT

2: Jumped to 277.5kg/611.9lbs, which was about a 5lb PR. As soon as I unracked I got super excited because I just *knew* it was going to be a smokeshow. Unfortunately I got too excited and cut it high, which is a shame because it also flew. NO LIFT

3: I stayed at the same weight, 277kg/611.9lbs. This also went up with ease, depth was good. GOOD LIFT for a lifetime PR

Part of me wishes I would have went ahead and jumped despite the bad lift, but I played it safe. 

**BENCH**

My bench has exploded over the past year. I was stagnant at about 390lbs for *years* until I just... wasn't? I just kept plugging away and grinding and early last year I broke through that plateau, and it's been climbing steadily since. 

1: I opened at 185kg/407.9. Moved like an opener. GOOD LIFT

2: I made an aggressive jump to 192.5kg/424.5lbs. Not sure why, I just saw that number on the page and had a gut feeling, and I was right. It was slower, but it went all the way up. GOOD LIFT for a lifetime PR

I opted out of a third attempt on bench. I *might* have has 195kg/430lbs in me, but I also knew I didn't want to really really grind for 2.5kg so I laid down instead. 

**DEADLIFT**

1: Opened at 277.5kg/611.9 and like the others, went up like it should. GOOD LIFT

2: Jumped to 285kg/628.4lbs, and it went up fairly easy, but definitely some grind to it. GOOD LIFT for a meet/kilo plate PR

3: Last attempt was 295kg/650.5lbs. I was *super* hyped for this, but it just wasn't there. I got it to my knees and *might* have been able to muscle it up, but I started to get that sparkly tunnel in my brain so I called it a day. NO LIFT. 

**TOTAL** 

755kg/1664.8lbs for a 65lb total PR. Ended up winning the 125kg Open and Submaster and *just narrowly* lost out on Best Overall. Not awful for a natty 36 year old living in a swirl of chaos. Going to take the next 4-6 weeks of serious training, enjoy the holidays, then maybe consider preparing for USPA Drug Tested Nationals in Atlanta next year.","powerlifting, fitness"
"The outdoors is my passion, right alongside powerlifting; however, ever since I started powerlifting back in 2019 it seems like those favorite outdoor activities are becoming more difficult (it band pain, knee pain, low back pain, etc.)

Does anyone have experience balancing their love of powerlifting while also balancing their love of movement in the outdoors? Or is it a case of choosing one or the other? 

I’d appreciate any input. Thank you!","powerlifting, fitness"
"\[Hi all. I posted this in one of the daily threads and didn't get any responses, so I'm trying the main board. The rules were a bit dubious on where this post would belong. I apologize if this still belongs in the daily thread. I'm happy to take down the post to oblige the rules of the community.\]  


 

**Bottom line: Looking for some perspective on selecting my openers for my first PL meet.**

**Context:** Saw that there was a USPA meet in my hometown in mid-Dec. Got a wild hair on my ass and decide to register. It will be my first-ever meet. I'm about four weeks out from the meet. Not the ideal timeline to just find out about a meet, but whatever. I don't expect to be competitive. I have a bad combination of being too weak, fat, and young to actually be competitive. This is mostly just for the experience and challenge.

**Me:** 37 yo, male, \~240 lbs, 5'8"", diagnosed with low T (150 ng/dl, on low dose T now for about 3 months but haven't gotten updated blood, no AI)

**Training background:** Been doing SS off/on since Jan 2020. Started with all empty bars and progressed from there. Didn't really have a lifting background prior to this other than fooling around in the gym while deployed during my military time. I've progressed to the point where I'm now doing a modified SS Texas Method. Biggest deviation is that I do lift sumo instead of conventional due to recurring low-back issues (from poor conventional form most likely). If you're familiar with the TM, you'll notice my ""intensity"" weights and my ""volume"" weights.

**Current lifts:** (note, I've never approached a session in the gym with the goal of ""discovering"" my 1RM, 3RM, 5RM, so I don't know what my peak numbers could be. The below numbers are just where I am currently at in my progression. I have about one more week where I will likely be boosting each of these lifts about 5-10 lbs for multiple reps before I switch focus to mock meet prep and lifting with commands. All weights below are in lbs.

**Squats**

Intensity: 355x1x5, then 360x1x1 for fun

Volume: 310x5x5

**Bench**

Intensity: 265x(2,1,1,1)

Volume: 227.5x5x5

**Deadlift**

Intensity: 350x1x5 and 360x1x1 for fun

Volume: 306x3x5

**Meet Lifts:** Considering this is my first meet, I anticipate a lot of stage fright/performance anxiety. As such, I've decided to go with pretty conservative openers because, at this point, every successful lift is a Meet PR. I've never lifted with commands, but that will be my focus from Thanksgiving to the Dec 18 meet. I believe my form is pretty rock-solid as far as getting three whites goes. It strictly follows the SS form, so not an optimal PL competition form, but it will get me whites if I stick to what I'm familiar with.

*Squat opener:* 160 kg / 353 lbs

*Bench opener:* 110 kg / 243 lbs (I'm most nervous about my bench due to the pause at the bottom while waiting for the cue. I don't bounce, but I don't pause either.)

*Deadlift opener:* 160 kg / 353 lbs

Am I totally off base on anything? Do the openers seem like reasonable targets based on where I'm at? For my second and third attempts, I have three numbers preselected based on how the previous lift felt, ie a safe option, a strong option, and a stretch option. Pie in the sky, I'd love to have at least 6/9 successful lifts and break 1,000 lbs.","powerlifting, fitness"
