"Marathon is the reaper marathon in south carolina, july 17th. 

https://runsignup.com/Race/SC/Seneca/CarolinaReaper

I've been training by running long periods of time consecutively in the given time frame-- last week I ran 15 consecutive miles at like a 13:30 pace. But the catch with this race is that the 26.2 miles are broken into 2.6 mile chunks, and every runner has 45 minutes to complete a given chunk. **If you finish early, you can't start the next chunk, but you have to wait until the next chunk starts.**


My questions are:

a) should I train in the manner the race is being run? or if I can run x miles consecutively at a given pace is it safe to say I can run that same amount broken up even faster?

b) what should I do for these breaks besides hydrate? stretch? sit? jog? walk? I want to stay loose but also staying loose for 8 hours is a long time to be loose

c) any other thoughts?



e: janitor dm'd me, per their request my goal is just to finish",fitness
"I’m 21, male. My height is 6’1ish and weight goes between 184lb to 190lb( mostly stays at 186). I do not have the best diet, I eat some junk food sometimes and sugary stuff. My sleeping routine is messed up even tho I started sleeping early and get 7/8 hours of sleep. Done with the informations, I started lifting about less than 2 months ago,  my aim is always been strength, I don’t really care as now to be cut and lean (aesthetic), I’d rather be big and bulky with some strength. Here’s my progress in the 3 main compound exercises: my bench went from 115lb 1rm to 185 1rm as now, I set my goal to bench 225 1 rep max by the end of 2021. My squats went from 185 1x4 to 225 lb 1x5 and my deadlift went from 315 1rm to 1x5 and my 1rm is 365. So the question is how is my progress? I really want to have powerlifting numbers one day, bench 495, squat 600 and deadlift at least around 800. These are veryyyyy big numbers and professional powerlifters number and I KNOW IT WILL TAKE YEARS to even come close, but I’m fully committed to take this path in life. Do you guys think it will be possible for me? Do I have potential? Thank you",fitness
"Hello friends!

**Intro**:

Salutations from the bodyweight fitness and calisthenics community! I just wanted to make a post showing my 5 years of progress in fitness and how calisthenics and gymnastics changed my fitness journey in the past 2 years.

Since this is a general fitness discord, I'd thought it'd be cool focus and share some of the fun stuff and training that goes on with bodyweight fitness :)

**General Thoughts and Summary**:

So to keep a long story short, I started lifting in middle school (around 7th grade). At the time I didn't really know much about training and I wasn't consistent so I lifted weights on and off all the way through high school (2016 picture).

Once I got to college, I had easier access to a gym and got a bigger and stronger because of that (2019 picture). I trained with weights and focuses mainly on bodybuilding.

* The convenience of my college gym was really conducive to my progress.
* Having a base fitness background isn't need for bodyweight training but is helpful.

Then around the end of my junior year in college, I met some people that showed me calisthenics so I started training it the Summer of 2019 and fell in love with it. I incorporated it into my training and exercised a lot more frequently.

As time went on I started training on Gymnastics rings, now I'm the strongest and fittest I've ever been (2021 picture). The things I'm currently training are quite high level.

Here's just some general thoughts regarding that.

* Consistency is king, I became much stronger through calisthenics because I was training more regularly vs when I was purely lifting weights.
* Really enjoying my training made it much more effortless to exercise which helped with consistency.
* Bodyweight training can expose weak links and lagging areas. I developed more mobility and body control because calisthenics movements required more of that. This also helped me reduce injuries because I had to ensure my weakest links were strong.
* Turns out I'm very good at calisthenics and rings. My body type is quite ideal for that so I've been able to achieve some very high level skills

If you're someone that's tired/bored of their current training style, then maybe exploring other forms of training, such as bodyweight exercises, might be what you're looking for. Currently I do mainly calisthenics with weight lifting supplementary exercises.

My current goal is to achieve F skills on rings (Pretty much moves you only really see in the Olympics),  wish me luck :)

&#x200B;

**Training**:

* **Lifting Experience**:

So I pretty much did bro splits from middle school to most of college. I forget the exact splits I did but it probably wasn't anything smart of well thought out. I think it was something like: Biceps + Back, Triceps + Chest, Shoulder + Something Else, and Legs

Really most of my progress at this time was noob gains and that I was lifting regularly. I didn't have any strong or impressive numbers on my lifts but I could rep out pushups and pullups. I also dabbled in weighted pullups and dips.

I think the main thing was weightlifting gave me a good strength foundation for when I eventually swapped to calisthenics. My two main problems with weightlifting were that personally for me I could've been more consistent with it and that I was always tight and stiff because I purely lifted and that's pretty much it.

Then I made the jump to calisthenics.

&#x200B;

* **General Info on Calisthenics**:

Before I get more into the calisthenics part of my training, just wanted to provide some general info.

1. There's many different things that fall under the umbrella of bodyweight training, I focused mainly on calisthenics and ring strength training.
2. Calisthenics strength training is similar to powerlifting (weighted calisthenics is basically just powerlifting but with weighted pullup, muscle up, and dips) and weight training in terms of training principle but instead of lifting weights you use your body. We use **progressions** (easier versions of exercises) to progressively overload to ultimately achieve some move usually referred to as a **skill**.
3. It's not just HIIT or high pushups and pullups!
4. Because our entire bodies are used, you'll notice weak links when you're training. This is great because in the long run it can bring up lagging body parts and lead to more balance, coordination, and mobility (can't do a handstand if you don't have shoulder mobility). Good form is very important!
5. One thing to highlight is a lot of high level strength moves require straight arms (referred to as **straight arm strength** or SAS). Because of that, we also have to account for our tendons and joints because some moves can hit them quite hard. Tendons take longer to develop than muscle so it's wise to not try to progress too fast, you can risk injuring yourself.
6. Don't want to toot my own horn but don't take my progress as being indicative of everyone that trains calisthenics. The progress I've made is quite fast and I'm currently doing moves some people have dedicated years to achieving. I'm probably around the top 1-2% of people strength skill wise training calisthenics. But definitely try, it's an awesome time!
7. Sorry if some of the exercise names/terms aren't familiar to you! The clips I have linked should show what they look like. Here's a chart that does a pretty good job of listing exercises and their level of difficulty: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit?usp=sharing)
8. Skills difficulty rating. So the Gymnastics Code of points rates skills from A - K where A is the easiest and F is the hardest. For rings, the highest scoring moves are F. Right now I've achieved/working on C, D, E skills. For context an Iron Cross ([https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/39/fd/7939fd84b0e836f8d773f7c74288f69f.jpg)) is a B skill.

Hopefully this clears up some things and provides a bit of context. Definitely check out r/bodyweightfitness FAQ for more info, it's a useful resource!

Ok now to the calisthenics stuff!

* **Summer Before Senior Year**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=183](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=183)

Around June of 2019 is when I started. After doing research I decided I'd train for a front and back lever. I just YouTubed ""Front Lever"" tutorial and ""Back Lever"" tutorial and found a bunch of useful progressions and exercises which I incorporated into my lifting routine.

Essentially what I did was FL on pull and BL on push days. I trained PPLPP (or something like that I can't remember). The way I structured my workout was Static progressions in the beginning, then dynamics, then weights (which could be weighted calisthenics, bench, accessory workout etc.)

Overall, training was pretty straight forward and I got both moves before the end of the summer.

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 1**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=324](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=324)

Once the summer was over, I decided to continue my current training style. I focused on calisthenics with weights but now that I had FL and BL (with ok form. I also couldn't do it all the time) I decided I would work towards full planche.

So I pretty much continued in a similar training manner as I mentioned earlier and eventually got a full planche by the end of the semester (or about 4 months). Well, not really...Because my form was actually really bad and my elbows were bent so I wasn't actually doing a full planche. I didn't realize it at the time that I wasn't actually planching. Because I didn't know better I continued on thinking I was ready for harder moves.

I made a post regarding my planche mistake previously here if you want to take a look at that: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full\_planche\_vs\_fake\_plache\_do\_it\_right\_the\_first/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/k1069j/full_planche_vs_fake_plache_do_it_right_the_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

* **Senior Year Semester 2**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=456](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=456)

When my last semester of Senior year started I joined the gymnastics club and made some really cool friends. I also had access to a gymnastics gym too. This is where I fell in love with rings and realized I wanted to train towards advanced ring moves.

So I started working towards Iron Cross and full planche on rings. I used the straps on forearms method to train for cross, but honestly it was mostly a waste of time. The straps didn't really develop the proper straight arm strength for cross, so other than some initial shoulder development I didn't find it useful.

I was also making fake progress on planche too (I thought it was real progress at the time). I progress all the way from tuck to a full planche (bent arms so it doesn't count) on rings. I also started exploring planche pushups but again the form was terrible.

On the bright side, my weighted calisthenics was going well. I increased my one rep max weighted pull and chinup to 2 plates. I also could do dips with a plate and a half with good form. I could also do 2 plates but it wasn't parallels so I don't count it. Oh I also got one arm chinups so that was also pretty awesome too!

&#x200B;

* **Summer**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=621](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=621)

So my senior year was a cut a bit short because COVID started at this point. I went back home around April 2020. I luckily made the smart decision to buy a power rack and continue training in my backyard and house which really payed off.

Earlier I started noticing there were weird quirks with my planche but I was still convinced I had a full planche. I posted a form check on reddit and someone pointed out my arms were bent. I was sad about it for a little while but eventually came to terms with it.

Again, check out the planche or YT video for more details b/c I'm mostly repeating myself. But TLDR I started from scratch, got injured from planche training for a few weeks, recovered, trained it some more but correctly (eblows locked) and eventually got a full planche.

For other moves Iron Cross was still a grind, I had to go through a few iterations and setups on how to train it to replace the strap method. I eventually ended on using resistance bands but my form always felt off so I was in an awkward limbo with the move.

On the bright side, around this time I started dabbling in other moves to improve on. They include front lever rows, one arm front lever, RTO dips, impossible dips, and victorian cross. I will never achieve these moves.

It was around this time I also found out about ""Overcoming Gravity 2"". I think it's really good and useful book. Great reference point for training and it helped me start thinking of other training concepts that I eventually started incorporating later on.

&#x200B;

* **Fall and Winter**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=936](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=936)

Once it started getting too cold to train outside, I moved my stuff inside and continued training. I made a good amount of progress during this time. All the foundational work I improved on over the summer began paying dividends.

I could actually full planche for a few seconds so I started working towards harder variations like full planche pushups and planche press.

Iron Cross was still kicking my ass so no real update there.

I managed to get a few reps of FL rows with a false grip and some of the other moves I was dabbling with over the summer where also improving. The most noteworthy one is that my victorian cross form was shaping up well. I was using lighter bands.

Really the main thing that happened during this time is the gradual progress I was making with most things I was training and the fact I incorporating some simple periodization. I spent a more time refreshing my knowledge of training and periodization was one thing that really stuck out to me. Incorporating that helped me feel less tired and in danger of hurting myself in the long run vs what I used to do (i.e. not take deload weeks)

&#x200B;

* **Now**: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)

Ok at this point I got really strong. Training wise I had a good understanding of how my body worked and how I needed to structure my workouts that worked best for me. I also incorporated a bit more complex periodization (though it wasn't always consistent) where I would ramp up and build towards strength phases. Also, I bought a dream machine for cross training, it was pricey but I found it useful.

Here's some clips of some of the other things I've managed to achieve. A lot of this skills are quite advanced so I'm really proud of myself :)

* Full Planche, Full Planch Pushups, Full Planch on Rings, Full Planche Press to Handstand: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1050](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1050)
* Impossible Dips and 3 Plate Dip: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1135](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1135) (not bellow parallel so needs more work)
* Front Lever Rows and One Arm Front Lever: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1228](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1228)
* 3 Plate Chinup: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1254](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1254)
* Maltese: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1288](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1288)
* Victorian Cross: [https://youtu.be/0\_7z6VscypA?t=1272](https://youtu.be/0_7z6VscypA?t=1272) which was super sick, you rarely see this in the Olympics.
* and more

Still no iron cross...hate that move. The dream machine I bought has been much more helpful in training towards it bs bands though so that's nice. Slowly making progress on it now!

&#x200B;

* **Current Goals**:

I still love training calisthenics, my main life goal is to achieve F skills on rings eventually. Currently I'm focusing at the moment on getting Iron Cross, cleaning up my Maltese, Maltese Cross, and cleaning up my Victorian Cross

**Diet and Nutrition**:

* **General Info**:

I don't have much to say on my diet so this section is going to be brief. I'm in a lucky position where I've always been relatively skinny so I've never had to focus to much time on losing weight.

When I was in college, I was in a University that was ranked for having one of the best dinning services in the US. I always had access to healthy foods back then so my diet was varied and relatively clean with the occasional eating out. It was balanced as in I ate my fruits, veggies, grains, meats in most my meals. I couldn't tell you exactly what I ate because it was mostly intuitive. I don't count calories or anything.

Since college I've been living with my folks (moving out around April so that's exciting) and they cook every day. It's traditional Bengali dishes, so again food is generally clean and varied. I do however not eat as much veggies and fruits as I used back in college and need to fix that from a nutrition stand point. But over all I have an easy time maintaining a consistent weight. I also rarely drink alcohol.

* **Bulking and Cutting**: So I don't bulk or cut. I like slowly gaining weight over time. That's just me.
* **Supplementation**: I take creatine and protein powder that's it. I think most people do not ""need"" supplements, a good rule of thumb is to use supplements to enhance lagging parts of your diet. Actually requiring supplements is probably a conversation between you and your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\_7z6VscypA&t=1298s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_7z6VscypA&t=1298s)

This post is already pretty long now so I'll keep this section a bit short.

* Fitness has had a huge positive impact on my life! I'm so glad I started lifting weights in middle school :D. I hope everyone else also has an great fitness journey.
* Switching to calisthenics took my fitness journey to the next leve. I'm the strongest I've ever been because of it. This isn't because calisthenics is any better than other forms of training. I just have some much more fun training it which has helped me stay consistent and discplined.
* I've also met awesome people through it's really been a net positive in my life
* Be honest with yourself when you train, bad form can really waist your time or get you hurt.
* Hopefully this post was somewhat informative and peaks others interest into the wonderful world of bodyweight training (it's more than just calisthenics)

All the best,

"**INTRO**

About a year ago, I proposed an idea for a weight gaining training block that was effectively stringing together the most effective weight gaining blocks I had used in an ascending order of difficulty.  It went 5/3/1 BBB Beefcake, 5/3/1 Building the Monolith, Deep Water Beginner and Deep Water Intermediate, with deloads as appropriate.  It was a bit uncharacteristic of me, as I tend to only vouch for approaches I’ve personally used, and though I had run all these programs individually, I had never run them in this order as a training block.  I figured it would work well enough, but then my schedule opened up and I found myself with the opportunity to actually run the full 26 week program…and discovered it was even MORE effective than I could have possibly imagined.  What I intend to do here is document my experience in running the whole programming block, takeaways and lessons learned.

**THE PROTOCOL AND INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM REVIEW**

[For the full layout of all 26 weeks of programming, go here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/)

[For my review of Deep Water Intermediate on this protocol, go here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/oz5wbv/program_review_deep_water_intermediate_mythical/)

**RESULTS?**

It’s going to upset quite a few people that I never weighed myself for this weight gain program, but if you read through any of my program reviews you’ll most likely understand why: shift work makes my lifestyle pretty crazy.  Getting a pre-breakfast/post bowel movement weigh in was a luxury I simply couldn’t afford in most cases, which meant weigh ins that I COULD get would be wildly inconsistent with too many variables in play.  In full disclosure, I was concerned that the data would screw with my head and make me compromise my nutrition, so I just skipped the scale and focused on the mirror and the weights moved in the weightroom.  So with that, I’ve got some not great before and after photos of the whole process, and I ended up deadlifting 405lbs for 100 reps in 8 sets, which is something I’ve literally never done in my life before.  I am legitimately the strongest I’ve ever been while being significantly leaner than I ever was at previous strength levels.

[START OF PROGRAM](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/tnation/uploads/default/original/4X/b/3/1/b31dc938145e47f29754bac921f5927ef355de01.jpeg)

**THOUGHTS ON HOW THE PROGRAMS ALL FIT TOGETHER**

* These programs just feed incredibly well into each other.  Starting off with BBB Beefcake does a great job of getting you acclimatized to higher volume work if you’ve been staying low volume.  5x10 is an excellent wake up call, and the heavier percentages of Beefcake compared to traditional BBB absolutely push the trainee hard enough that they’re gonna need to eat big to recover.  I actually found the 5s progression on the main work to be one of the more challenging aspects of the program, specifically on the final weeks of the cycle, and often found myself dreading THAT part the most.  

* Going into Building the Monolith from BBB Beefcake, things transform a little.  BtM by itself seems like it’s really high volume, but when you run it after Beefcake it ACTUALLY feels more like an intensification block.  You’re lifting higher percentages for lower reps across multiple sets for most of your barbell work.  Suddenly, those 5s pro top sets you were doing in BBB Beefcake have become 3-5x5 sets.  It’s INTENSE.  I found it helpful to set my training max for BtM as the same lifts I used for the final cycle of BBB Beefcake (so repeating my previous TMs) vs advancing them between the two programs, as it meant I’d be ending week 3 doing 3-5x5 with a weight I had previously only managed 1 set with.  Again: that sort of foreboding presence puts the fear in you so that you NEED to eat to be able to succeed.  Meanwhile, the growing volume is in the assistance work, which will actually be a pretty nice break for you.  BBB can beat you up, as it’s a LOT of barbell work and fairly heavy, whereas now we’re doing dips, chins, pull aparts, etc.  Make the most of it.

* On the above, BtM is going to be the program that beats you down the most by TOTALLY owning your life, ASSUMING you are running it correctly.  Anyone that tells me it’s a 3 day program earns a special place on my list of ire.  BtM is a SIX day program.  You lift weights 3 days, and then you do CONDITIONING 3 days.  The conditioning is KEY.  If you do not do it, you are only doing half the program, and if you’re doing the full diet of a dozen eggs and 1.5lbs of ground beef a day, you’re going to get fat.  But if you do the conditioning, that diet will be enough to help you survive.  Every time I’ve run BtM, I’ve developed some sort of scheduling anxiety, because there is so little wiggle room with 6 day a week training.  Also, you really SHOULD get a prowler for this program.  Prowlers are just plain awesome in general, but they’re especially awesome for recovering from squat soreness, as they have no eccentric movement.  An Aidryne would be cool too, but I sold mine because I don’t care to have it for home workout equipment.  I think it’s a GREAT piece of cardio equipment, but I train in the VERY early AM, and an airdyne sounds like you’re mowing your lawn inside your house.

* Going from Monolith into Deep Water Beginner is, once again, a system shock, and I feel like that’s actually what makes this training block so effective.  These programs already work in isolation, but the whole way that periodization works is to basically introduce a stimulus to the body until it’s no longer effective and then to change the stimulus.  If we stay with the same method/approach for too long, we get stale.  So many folks “try” to do this, but are so afraid to venture away from their comfort zones that it’s just paying lip service.  “Instead of 5x5, I’ll do THREE sets of 5!”  Instead, we bounced from 5x10 to 5x5 to 10x10, and now the weight never changes but the rest times DO.  This is why you wanna make sure you’ve absolutely blasted the conditioning work up to this point, because if you didn’t, it will show and you will be hurting.  Your ability to recover between sets is crucial.  Also on that note, weeks 1 and 2 should NOT be a nutkick.  You should NOT be going into Deep Water on those weeks.  I saw a lot of people dork up this program by not feeling like these weeks were challenging enough and upping the weights.  Then they got to weeks 5 and 6 and couldn’t complete them.  You’re going to be resting HALF as long between sets when this is all done: weeks 1 and 2 SHOULD feel a little easy.

* I shouldn’t need to write this, but apparently I do: don’t skip out on the clean pulls on back day, don’t swap out the barbell rows, and do the shrugs with a barbell.  That entire day is prepping you for the intermediate program, wherein you will be doing 100 power cleans.  The clean pulls are teaching you how to get power from the starting position, the rows are about keeping a strong torso during the transition, and the shrug is for the final pull.  There is a method to the madness.  

* For picking weights on this program, I didn’t want to bother testing 1rms, nor did I want to use my training maxes.  Since I had done sets of 10 on BBB Beefcake, I figure I had a pretty good idea of what a challenging set of 10 would be, so I took the weights I used on the final week of BBB Beefcake, took 5-10lbs off of them, and used those for my Deep Water workout weights.  This proved REALLY effective.  I knew I could get 5x10 of these done with about 2-3 minutes of rest between sets, so, once again, I had the fear in me necessary to know I was gonna need to eat BIG if I wanted to get twice as many sets done with only 2 minutes of rest.

* Intermediate feeds logically from beginner because these programs were actually meant to be run like that, but it’s still cool how awesome Deep Water is set up.  I, once again, did no 1rm testing nor did I use any calculators.  At this point, my conditioning was so through the roof that I was stupidly “10 rep adapted”, and trying to run the Deep Water calculator in reverse was having it spit out insane 1rms (like a 750lb deadlift), so I employed some “Kentucky windage” and added 20-30lbs to everything and went from there.  

* Something that’s really cool when all of this is done: if you did it right, you end up moving for 10x10 MORE weight than what you were doing for 5x10 at the end of BBB Beefcake. That’s a GREAT feeling.

**HELPFUL MODIFICATIONS**

* For Beefcake, I ran it 3/5/1 vs 5/3/1, meaning that the middle week was the lightest week.  I like doing this because it gives you something like a mini deload before the heaviest week.  I also took to changing the challenge level without playing with the weights.  For dealifts, I’d do the 3s week with a powerlifting bar, the 5s week with an axle, and the 1s week with a deadlift bar.  The weights were all as prescribed, but challenge still shifted.  For the press, I would clean the first rep of each set on the 3s week, clean every rep on the 5s week, and take the weight out of the rack on the 1s week.  

* I ended up appreciating the effect of cleaning the weight from the floor for presses that I did it through all the other programs.  For BtM, once again I played around such that I clean only the first rep on the heaviest week.  For the 3s week, I’d clean every rep.  For the 5s week, I used a log and did viper presses.  This all creates a great metabolic demand on the body, which will compel you to eat more. 

* For the widowmakers on BtM, I ended up taking them until I couldn’t do any more reps, rather than stop at 20. I felt like this was better prep for Deep Water.

* Not a modification, but just a helpful tip: get decent straps for deadlifting.  You’ll want them for Deep Water.

**NUTRITION**

* When I threw together the training block, I included the associated nutritional recommendations by author.  For BBB Beefcake, I took the diet Jim included with the 3 month BBB challenge, as they’re honestly the same thing: Beefcake just takes that challenge and turns it into a 3 WEEK challenge, and runs it twice.  Monolith was the dozen eggs and 1.5lbs of ground beef, Deep Water was Deep Water.  As for what I PERSONALLY did, I ran what I deemed “Deep Mountain”, which was effectively the Deep Water diet BUT, if I deviated, it was a Mountain Dog approved deviation ala John Meadows (RIP John, you’ll be missed).  Ultimately all this boiled down to was adding some VERY dark chocolate to my diet (92-100%) and including a small amount of grassfed butter with my breakfast, along with focusing on ensuring my fat sources were organic and, if animal, came from an animal fed it’s natural diet.  I actually tried adding in some more diverse foods, to include wild blueberries, but found that they were upsetting my digestion.  I also had to stop eating walnuts for similar reasons.  I’m 35 now, and finding, as I get older, my body develops intolerances and sensitivities rather easily.  I still try to get diversity in my diet, but when you’re eating a TON of food ALL the time to support growth, you eventually have to settle on a “greatest hits” playlist of foods that DON’T cause issues.  One bad bit of digestion can really throw off the plan.

* Big takeaway is that the whole reason you are doing this is to gain weight.  The training is INSANELY difficult, and if you are too afraid to eat, you’ll get crushed.  I was able to prove to myself that you don’t need to eat junk to get there.  And, something kind of interesting: when you are absolutely stuffing yourself with GOOD food (don’t be coy and stupid: you know what good food is), you have no craving for junk.  My only craving was for NO food.  Missing meals sounded awesome.

**CONDITIONING**

* As stated, BtM has its own pre-defined conditioning.  BBB Beefcake just says to balance it against the supplemental work, and Deep Water has the active recovery day built in and that’s about it.  If it’s your first time running these programs, that should all be fine.  For myself, I wanted to really push the envelope and took it upon myself to do some form of conditioning every day (as in 7 days a week), and often multiple conditioning sessions in a day.  The intent was two fold here.  One: when I started this training block, I was the leanest I had ever been and got there with a diet that had me SIGNIFICANLTY slash my dietary fats, and I was concerned my hormones were suffering as a result.   I wanted to intake a LOT of dietary fats as a means of course correction, and doing so much conditioning was a way to ensure that all this energy I was taking in got put to good use.  The second reason was that I find conditioning work, when done correctly, has a tonic effect on the body and can promote recovery between workouts.  The first time I ran Deep Water, I would walk like a toy soldier 6 days out of every week because my legs were so sore.  In my experience, crossfit style barbell WODs and prowler pushing were both VERY helpful for recovery.  To get rid of quad soreness, I’d use WODs that were thruster focused.  For whole body soreness, things like Grace of WODs with some manner of floor to overhead were awesome.  I found burpees a good way to recover from deadlifts, as they didn’t place any load on the body but still required the whole body to move through space.

* I also included a front squat based conditioning workout that I kept the entire time I ran all the programs.  For the majority of the 26 week block it was the “Juarez Valley” workout, where I’d open with a high rep topset (something along the realm of 8-16 reps), do 5 burpees, then do 1 rep, 5 burpees, then 1 rep less than the highest rep of the topset (so if I opened with 8, this would be 7 reps), 5 burpees, 2 reps, etc, meet in the middle.  For the final few weeks of Deep Water Intermediate, I used something I deemed “Tower of Babel”, which operated in a similar manner.  For this one, you started with 1 rep, did the buprees, then 2 reps, burpees, 3 reps, etc, building to a point where you can’t do any more reps, and then you work BACKWARDS to 1.  Both are absolutely brutal.  I’d chase the workout with a belt squat stripset and just absolutely nuke my quads.  This was my “active recovery” workout on Deep Water, and replaced the airdyne workout for Building the Monolith.  For BBB Beefcake, it was done typically after the deadlift day.

* The real benefit of all this focus on conditioning shone through during Deep Water.  The very first time I ran that program, I had to legit lay on the floor between sets once I got to about the 6th or 7th set.  I was just EXHAUSTED.  This time around, it certainly wasn’t a FUN experience, but I never had to go to the floor.  I stayed standing during all of my rests.  I was draped over my reverse hyper, sure, but that’s about my standing resting position. And being able to recover so well between sets meant I absolutely crushed the workouts.

* All of that said: keep the goal the goal.  If your conditioning is taxing your recovery to the point you can’t succeed in training, back it off. If you cannot eat enough to recover from conditioning, back it off.

**WHAT IF I’M NOT READY?**

* Just by happenstance, I had run 2 cycles of 5/3/1 SVR II before this training block, and I think that was about the best thing I could have done.  SVR II has Widowmakers, BBB and Second Set Last 5x5 all built into it, which will give you a sampling of things to come over the next 6 months. A few cycles of it will do you good.

**CONCLUSION**

* 26 weeks is a LONG time to spend gaining weight, so make sure you have a clear schedule, a reliable source of steady nutrition, and a lot of fortitude.  If you are prepared, this could very well be the most effective training protocol you ever employ.  It was for me.",fitness
"I've been listening to the Huberman Lab podcast and in episode 19, he describes a study where cooling your palms in-between sets radically increased the number of reps a person can do (300% for dips!). 

The idea is that hyperthermia limits performance and cooling through the extremities prevents that.

Huberman claims that this methodology is being used by lots of sports teams and that they've been getting great results.

Frankly, this sounds way too good to be true. 

[There are a number of peer reviewed papers demonstrating the effect](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22076097/), however:

* They're from the original authors, who started a company to commercialize the technology
* The company was founded in 2000 and don't appear to have been able to bring anything to market in the last 20 years.
* I found a couple examples of replications that don't show anything like the effect size the original authors see, plus the results don't show a proper dose/response.

I'm tempted to try this myself to see if there's any validity to the claims (easy enough experiment and claimed gains are enormous). 

***Has anyone tried palm or extremity cooling themselves or know of any independent publications that either prove or debunk it?***",fitness

**Background Info**

I started lifting with my dad as a young kid. I am in my mid-thirties now. There were some extended breaks from training over the years, but I always maintained an active physical lifestyle playing sports, working construction, etc. 

You can find more detailed background information in my previous program writeups.

*(Links are to removeddit, give them time to load)*

So fast forward a bit, and we get to spring 2021. I just wrapped up *”Simple Jack’d”*, and decided to sign up for a meet. Now I had to decide how to train for it.

---

**Enter – DLED – Deadlift Every Day**

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.
I decided to start this program with a new approach, similar to *""Simple Jack’d""*, but with some rules.

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.   
2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.  
3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.  

If the week goes well and all the reps are completed, add 1 rep, or 1% to the daily minimum, and move onto week 2. Maintain the weekly 1 rep minimum at the same intensity unless I  set a new 1RM PR.

[**In the end, this is how my 50 days of programming looked.**](https://imgur.com/a/3rqWd7v)

* Week 1: 3 reps at 605 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 2: 3 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 3: 4 reps at 610 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 4: 4 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 675+ Every Week
* Week 5: 5 reps at 615 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 6: 5 reps at 635 Every Day, 1 at 690+ Every Week
* Week 7: 1 rep at 675 Every Day, 1RM Conventional and Sumo
* Day 50: 700 AMRAP

**DLED Accessories/Assistance**

I decided to pair my high frequency low volume deadlifting, with the polar opposite for accessory work. A basic, single muscle group per day, “Bro Split”. I would hit that single muscle group with high volume of a single lift, and then move on.

**Cardio**
I [ran 171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) over the course of these 50 days. An average of 3.4 miles per day. My longest run was 8 miles.

I strongly believe that a good base of cardiovascular fitness enables me to work harder, longer, and in the end, lift more weight.

**Training Log/Highlights**

My full deadlift training log for these 50 days can be found [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K5QE-2xhDuRMh3LIGg5N7aONbVOcy-VV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true) with videos of the top set each day hyperlinked in the log.

**Data / Summary**

Overall I hit 187 reps over 600lb in 50 days, for a total volume of 120,252 lb. That's makes the average day 3-4 reps at 640+

The lowest daily weight I hit was 605, the highest was 752 off the floor, and 815 off of wagon wheels with the top set estimating out to 889 on day 50 ([702x8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJztQowXHAr0G3hi-cGUUHlFwRxytpk0/view?usp=drivesdk))

Of those reps, 134 were hook grip, and 53 were strapped, 32 were conventional, and 155 were sumo.

**Using Variation to combat Fatigue**

If you look through the training log, or have followed any of my comments in the weightroom daily discussion threads, you’ll notice that I used a LOT of variation throughout the last 50 days.

These variations weren’t chosen entirely haphazardly. In fact, I put a lot of thought into what I was going to do each day/week ahead of time, and then paid close attention to how I felt to adjust along the way.

Here are a couple examples of how lift selection could facilitate recovery or increase stimulus without just adding/decreasing weight:

* When my [thumbs were hurting](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj) I would use straps
* If my hips felt good I would pull sumo
* If my lower back was feeling good, I would pull conventional
* If my lower back and hips were both feeling good I would go heavier, and hit more than my daily minimum intensity
* If my upper back felt strong and rested, but I didn’t want to overwork my lower back or hips, I would add bands or chains, increasing the intensity at the top of the lift, without increasing demands at the bottom
* When my positioning felt sloppy, I would add paused reps.

Every variation had a purpose, and was chosen to fit that day based on how I felt when I woke up, and in the hours leading up to my training.

---

**Diet, Sleep, Recovery**

My starting weight was 228 and my ending weight was 225, a net loss of 3lb

I tracked calories for a bit at the beginning of this 50 day period, but stopped about halfway through. At the time I was eating around 4,200 calories per day and maintaining. 

As for *what* I eat... it varies, but I'm a big fan of carbs. I aim for 180g+ of protein,  100g+ of fat, and then fill in the remaining with 600+g of carbs

I usually start the day with some sort of PB&J, my favorite is to [Toast a Blueberry Bagel, add Chunky Peanut Butter, Honey, Raspberry Jelly, Fruity Pebbles]() and maybe a banana. 

Mid day I usually eat out, because I work pretty far from home. My go-tos are burritos, sandwiches, pizza, all the good stuff people tell you to avoid if you are a serious lifter... I eat it.

Dinner is usually whatever my wife makes, it changes all the time due to kids, and I don't worry too much about it.

If I am hungry, I eat more.

If I'm tired, I eat more.

If I'm sore, I eat more.

If I am feeling achy or run down? I'll eat a bunch of gummy worms and drink a half gallon of OJ, then go for a run.

I don't take / never have taken steroids. Due to a pituitary tumor I have [multiple recent blood tests](https://imgur.com/a/o1xQk6F) showing my T levels, and offer my physique as further evidence.



I try to go to sleep before 10:00pm every night, and usually wake up around 5:00am

I do LISS cardio as often as possible, preferably in more frequent, shorter doses

*(I find that two 5ks are easier to recover from than a single 10k)*

**CNS fatigue and overtraining**

You see it all the time on internet forums. 
“You cant do X, you’ll overtrain”, or “Deadlifts are too taxing on the CNS to do more than a single set of 5 per week”

Obviously that’s ridiculous. 

Now, I am not going to say overtraining isn’t real, or that it doesn’t happen. It does. But it is just REALLY hard to get to that point if you are paying attention to the other variables. 

If deadlifting 600-750 for reps every day for weeks on end, while also running [171 miles](https://imgur.com/a/ZNkO9Po) doesn’t result in overtraining, you are probably going to be OK adding that 3rd set of curls to the end of your 5x5 LP

The key is to focus on what I mentioned above in diet/sleep/recovery. 

Eat, sleep, do your conditioning. 

**Pain and Injury**

I’ve dealt with many injuries over the years, from broken bones and torn muscles, to herniated discs, jambs, sprains, and dislocations…. and I had a few little bangs and tweaks over the last 50 days as well.

Going into this, I hadn’t pulled with a hook grip on a regular basis. Within the first week [I had bruising on both thumbs, a split in my thumb nail, and a tear on two fingers](https://imgur.com/a/YJl0kQj). It took some adjustment, but I learned how to fix my grip, and was able to train through the discomfort, to the point that I am now comfortable holding 750+lb without issue, and my thumbs are all healed up.

I also [smashed my toes](https://imgur.com/a/DesKPOx) one day, they bled a bit and bruised badly. I thought that my middle toe may have been broken, but a bit of tape holding it to the other toes, and some caution while running was enough to let me push through it. Although it is still hurting to this day.

Then, on day 46 I tweaked something in my lower back [pulling 700 beltless](https://imgur.com/a/Zg3NPrP). I actually felt a bit of a pop and immediately dropped to the ground. Everyone has heard of R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, elevation) but I refused to let a back injury sidetrack me again. 

I **immediately** started working at it. Instead of RICE I opted for **MEAT/METH**, Motion, Elevation, Analgesics, Treatment/Traction, and Heat. What this means, is that I didn’t just lay down. I started foam rolling, stretching, taking Ibuprofin, working the area with a lacrosse ball, heat packs, hot baths, hot showers, walking, and even some light jogging, etc.

On day 47 I woke up in the morning STIFF and SORE. I immediately attacked the issue again with the same ***Meth***ods. Later on I was able to [Deadlift 675 off wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/8f2RP2C), which reduced the ROM to the point of less discomfort, and got out for a nice run without too much pain.

On day 48 I was already feeling significantly better, but I was still stiff and sore. Once again, I employed the same methods and rehabbed my way through the pain until I could touch my toes with straight knees, and pick up my kids without holding my breath. Later that day I would [pull 765 pounds off of wagon wheels](https://imgur.com/a/cidrMI7) again. This time with even less discomfort than the day before.

On day 49 I woke up feeling like I was back to 80+%. But I took the time, and the medicine, and worked through the same drills and stretches. Later that day I would [pull 675 off the floor](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) for my first full ROM deadlift since the injury, and then go on to [pull 765, and 815](https://imgur.com/a/mlN6iqK) off the wagon wheels, ending with a nice big PR.

On day 50, I felt great, and finished with a big [702x8](https://imgur.com/a/F6ltIXw) deadlift AMRAP for a new all time PR on my estimated max… and did so completely pain free. 

I am still a bit tight and sore in the morning, but its improving every day, and I am diligent about working at it. Staying moving, working the area, taking basic meds like Ibuprofen, foam rolling, stretching, and even lifting all make a huge difference on healing faster.

**Conclusion**

This couldn’t have gone better. At the outset I had no idea I was about to put 40lb on my deadlift 1RM in only 50 days. 

[**Starting 1RM: 712 vs  Ending 1RM: 752**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lLbVGr8sXoPsYXhab3yQHSLJtWB6WRJD/view?usp=sharing)

And better yet, I learned a lot about myself, about training, about diet, and recovery, about pain and fatigue management, and more.

Probably not.

# Athletic history:

I had done sports pretty much my entire life, most notably fencing 4 days/12 hours per week from 2016-March 2018. I quit fencing and didn't do anything until November 2018 when I started messing around at my school gym.

# Training

I started going to the gym consistently at the start of 2019, though I didn't have a program. The starting lifting numbers are slightly inaccurate because I didn't max out lifts such as squats until much later. I remember failing a 115lbs bench very early in my training, and the 255lbs squat didn't come until around April or May of that year. My lifts at the end of this period were: 75kg/165 bench and 115/255 squat. I weighed 70kg/155 lbs.

At the start of summer, I switched to [reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) and made great gains. After 2 months, bench shot up to around 88kg/195 lbs and I gained some experience deadlifting. I weighed 72kg/155lbs. Because I was starting a new school year, I switched to [nSuns](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/nsuns-lp/) and really started going hard (2hrs+ sessions). During Late October, I maxed out again and hit a 95kg/210 lbs bench, 129/285 squat, and the heaviest I ever deadlifted was 137kg/300 lbs for 6.

After watching a [weightlifting video that got on my youtube recommended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfA8rAfHSI), I fell into the rabbit hole, watching [Clarence](https://www.youtube.com/user/clarence0), [Ashgabat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoj4DsAwJwg), and all types of weightlifting content. I decided to switch to weightlifting in November.

My weightlifting training has been pretty inconsistent: November 2019-February 2020, August 2020-October 2020, March 2021-today for a total of 12 out of 21 months. I also only train 3 days a week (my coach runs his gym as a passion project, so it's only open 3days/wk) which is significantly lower than nSuns or PPL. My weight also fluctuated a lot. I weighed 75kg/165lbs right before quarantine but dropped all the way to 70kg/155lbs by August 2020. I made it up to around 76/168 lbs in October but managed to keep my weight despite not training and I've been pretty stable at 82kg/180 lbs for a few months now.

Regardless of inconsistent training and weight, I made great squat PRs, hitting 145kg/321lbs in December 2019, 127kg/280 x 5 in October 2020, 143kg/315lbs x 5 in May 2021, and 162kg/357lbs for my first double bodyweight squat in June 2021. I had and have injuries in my wrist, so I've been unable to train the snatch for about 2 months, and I recently injured my shoulder so I wasn't able to do anything overhead for around 3 weeks.

I haven't benched for almost a year now and I haven't deadlifted anything above 130kg/286 lbs because I can only clean 118kg/260lbs.

# Diet

I don't have a very precise diet. I make sure to limit sugar heavily (only milk and water for the past 3-4 years, no candy, no ice cream, no sweet snacks like cookies/brownies) and roughly hit my calories/protein. However, more often than not I end up not eating enough. I usually eat 2 meals a day, sometimes only 1 because my sleep schedule is terrible. In college I hope to bulk up a lot because I'll have a much better diet.

For supplements, I never took anything until the start of July of this year, when I started taking creatine and vitamin D. I started drinking protein shakes but that's not really a supplement(?).

# Physique

Physique was never really one of my main goals but of course it's a nice bonus. Sucks that I couldn't get pictures of my legs before working out, but they were still pretty big regardless because of all the fencing (and soccer/track as well). I just wanted an opinion, do I really look like I'm 180 lbs? I always look at other people and think to myself like damn they're huge!, only for them to weigh less than me.

Some of my biggest inspirations are [apti aukadov](https://imgur.com/a/rDvicTd), [toshiki yamamoto](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k2zSsPxVCMs/maxresdefault.jpg), and [tian tao](https://www.thehandbook.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,height=300,fit=cover,q=85/https://files.thehandbook.com/uploads/2020/03/44378283-335510077244129-2228533361662492672-n.jpg)... Absolutely monstrous quads and a ripped, aesthetic upper body is a killer combination

# What's next?

I'm going to continue weightlifting for probably the rest of my life. I hope to squat 270kg and have a weightlifting total over 300kg one day. My current goal is a 200 kg squat by the time I'm 19 (next february) and to qualify for usaw junior nationals next year. In college I might do some bodybuilding and accessory training that I've been neglecting, and maybe even bench a little. I plan to bulk to 89kg and maybe far in the future 96kg (based on weight classes).

"I've seen a few posts about this but not too many answers. I'm a generally happy, calm person, not depressed but a bit prone to anxiety. I've noticed that over the last few years, exercise has gradually made me feel more anxious afterwards. Especially cardio (running or dance) or anything strenuous (like heavy weights), but even with more easy going workouts (yoga or a hike), I'll feel it. It seems to trigger an adrenaline or cortisol response, which lasts for a whiiiile. It makes sense to me, I think my body just assumes we're running from a tiger and it triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. My body feels stressed out after, for at least a few hours, if not the rest of the day, and I feel like my brain goes a bit fuzzy.

I feel fantastic when I'm exercising, just not so hot after, and it's really putting me off exercising at all. If I don't exercise, I feel happy and calm throughout the day. I try to make sure I'm eating a good diet, whole foods and enough calories. I don't eat sugar really, or take any stimulants. It doesn't seem to be common, but I see a few people on here share the same problem.

Things I've tried:  
Cooling down slowly  
Trying to not raise my heart rate too high  
Breathing exercises to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system afterwards

"Hi Reddit, it’s 10th day after I was tested with Covid (yeah, got it on New Year) with mild symptoms. I still have some coughing but otherwise feel much better.

Before it, I was training with different levels of effort for around 2 years and strictly followed bodyweight RR for last 2 months with good progression (from my point of view).

My question is when and how to resume working out. I think it may be an interesting discussion especially with this new variant as a lot of people either already went through this or will go soon. 

Some sources [1] tell that you need to wait at least 10-14 days after all symptoms are gone, but it sounds too harsh to me. Others [2,3] suggest for at least a week (also after all symptoms are gone). But again, minor coughing usually persist pretty long after Covid and I’m not sure if you should wait after it’s completely gone or a week after fever is gone is enough. 

I desperately want to resume these fun activities but afraid of making things worse to me. So, want to know if anyone has some experience/knowledge in returning to fitness after the illnesses. And what is the general rule of thumb of the community (I’m not seeking for a medical advice, just want to discuss with the people here their experience and issues in returning to fitness)

"[Side-by-side before and after pics](https://imgur.com/Uk6m5B0)

I am 27 years old and 6'4""

I bulked from [194](https://imgur.com/a/SLbtzhu) (skinny fat, regularly lifted for about a year) to [225](https://imgur.com/a/votJHjP) (fat) in 9 months. I was eating pretty “clean”, but just a lot of food. I sporadically tracked my calorie intake and I was eating close to 4,000 calories a day with 300g+ protein. I was gaining about 1-2lbs a week towards the end of the bulk. My training program was 7 days a week weight training (split: back and bicep, chest and tricep, legs, shoulders). Also, every other day 30-40 minutes MISS cardio (10 mile stationary bike, hill training mode). I was not logging my workouts but I was getting stronger and bigger (mostly fat). I decided to get serious with my diet and exercise routine and that’s when I noticed rapid progress. 

I began a cut and my goal was to get to sub-10% bodyfat in 4-6 months for beach vacations this summer. I used [this video]( https://youtu.be/yTiOH6ecktE) by Jeremy Ethier to as a guide for how to plan my diet. I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytN366VCGls) by Jeff Nippard as a guideline for how to eat. For the entire diet I was eating 220g+ protein and 20-30% calories from fat, the rest was carbs. I shot for 1-2lb fat loss per week and when I reached a plateau I either 1: Reduced my daily calorie intake by 50-100, usually from carbs. OR 2: Increased my daily activity level by adding a small amount of LISS cardio. I weighed and  cooked 95% of my food, and logged 100% of my food in MyFitnessPal. I weighed myself every morning and tracked my average weekly weight to see through daily fluctuations. I also stopped drinking alcohol completely during this cut. 

I began a 6 day PPL routine and began logging my workouts to track my progress and ensure I was progressively overloading my lifts. I designed my own programs that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/Z5JEoAh) and took deload weeks every 8-12 weeks and switched up the exercises afterwards. I was doing tons of volume in my routine, 20 sets per body part per week minimum. I would do 6-8 exercises per session and do the compounds first, doing 4 sets in the 8-10 rep range. Isolations came next with 3 sets in the 10-15 rep range. I would progressively overload by adding 1 or 2 reps each session until I reached the rep range ceiling. Then, up the weight and start at the bottom of the rep range. For example, a bench press one session would go Set 1: 185 x 10, Set 2: 185 x 10, Set 3: 185 x 9, Set 4: 185 x 9. The next session I would try for 4 sets of 10 with 185. After hitting that, I would increase the weight to 190 and try for 4 sets of 8. Rinse and repeat. I pushed myself and went close to failure on every set (8+ RPE), with ample rest between sets (3 minutes for compound, 2 minutes for isolation). I kept a timer going for the entire session to ensure the proper rest time and to make sure I was having enough time under tension. I aimed for at least 30 seconds TUT, but ideally 40 seconds per set. Because of this, my weight training takes about 1h 30m per day. I averaged about 50 minutes of LISS cardio every day (walking outside or incline treadmill) and began stretching 30-45 mins per day. I was also getting adequate rest, 7+ hours most nights. 

I got down to 181lbs carb depleted. 2 days later carb loaded I was 190lb and [this is me peaking with a pump](https://imgur.com/SbXwHCR). 3 weeks prior I was 10.7% body fat according to a DEXA scan, so I would estimate I am somewhere around 9% at my peak. 

I did not miss a single workout. I went on a couple diet breaks (1 full week about 4 months in and 1 weekend 5 months in). Other than that, I stuck to my diet and didn’t cheat. I had meals that were “dirty”, but I fit them in my macros. I used Greg Doucette’s cookbook for a lot of my meals. I learned from Jeff Nippard, Greg Doucette, Jeremy Ethier, Renaissance Periodization and a few others on YouTube how to diet, train, and supplement.  

All my lifts increased. I am dealing with a herniated disk and AC joint sprain, so I had to work around the big 3 (squat, deadlift, flat bench). But for reference I was able to go from 140lb to 270lb hack squat (for reps of 10) and on bench press I went from 185lb 4RM to 225lb in 4 months before my shoulder prevented me from going further. I have been adding 10lb per month on my incline DB bench since starting, going from 60lb to 85lb in 3 months. My waist is 4 inches smaller at the same body weight as a year ago.

If I could go back and change anything I would not have bulked up so heavy. I was chasing the number on the scale and wanted to get big. I didn’t use the mirror like I should have to gauge progress. A “dirty bulk” or “dreamers bulk” is not the way to go. It took me 6 MONTHS of strict dieting to strip away that fat. I probably lost a good amount of muscle in the process. Bulk up slow. Do body recomposition, or “gain-taining” if you are only 10-20lbs overweight. Find quality, evidence based sources of information online, like the YouTube channels I mentioned. Some things you just need to learn for yourself, but there’s a lot of advice that’s worth hearing.

Edit: for further context, [this](https://imgur.com/LVKNIY2) is where I was at 2 years ago at 170lb when I basically began attempting to lift regularly. My diet changed constantly and I was spinning my wheels up to the 194lb image above.",fitness
"Was doing wall sits and was just shocked how a max hold can smoke the quads harder than multiple reps of squats can. I started thinking about how doing negatives and static holds helped me achieve 10+ pull-ups when I previously couldn’t do a single rep.


How exactly do static exercises build muscle? I understand it’s time under tension. Old school ideology is high reps = muscle building, low reps = strength. I know that doesn’t exactly translate today, as strength builds muscle and endurance builds strength, but it still holds true to some extent.


So in theory, is a wall sit more akin to doing high rep leg press(or some other quad isolation). Or is it more like doing one max strength rep? Could someone technically do nothing but wall sits and build massive quads?

EDIT: lots of downvotes on this. I wasn’t suggesting this is as a substitution or even a thought about incorporating them into my workout. It was purely just a passing curiosity about the mechanism of action.",fitness
"Hey guys!

I came across a really interesting article and I am wondering if someone has done this type of training before, or what some people's thoughts are. 


To try to condense the article, it suggests using different weights to create uneven loads. It gives this example. ""When selecting your weights for off-balance weight training, start by making sure the heavier side has 5 to 10 pounds less than normal for unsupported movements (meaning not laying on the ground or on a bench). Then subtract another 5 to 10 pounds for the other side. For example, if your Walking Dumbbell Lunge is normally performed with 40-pound dumbbells in each hand, I’d start with a 30-pound dumbbell in one hand and a 20 or 25-pound dumbbell in the other hand. Then, and this is crucial, you want to make sure you perform an equal number of reps with the dumbbells swapped. So if you start with the heavier dumbbell in your right hand and the lighter dumbbell in your left hand, you need to ensure you’re performing an equal number of reps with the heavier dumbbell in your left hand and the lighter dumbbell in your right hand"". 

The justification for this type of training is that in the real world we dont deal with perfectly balanced weights, so training this way helps us in a more practical sense. It also discusses stabilizing muscles. 

Anyways, I'm interested in playing around with this type of training, but just wanted to see if someone has done this before and/or what are some people's thoughts.

"Hi guys,

Its been a while since my last post and I thought I'd just share where I am at with lifting and give an update now that I am 6-7 years into constently training (I think my last post was at 4 years into training for reference). 

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and after photo 01](https://i.imgur.com/4TrLyBH.jpg)

[Before and after photo showing legs lol 02](https://i.imgur.com/qKAbFPh.jpeg)

**WEIGHT:**

154lb (70KG) to 169lb (76.8KG) in the photos

169lb is me probably at my leanest. Usually if I am not dieting, I sit closer to 83kg/183lb. 

Timeframe is approximately 6+ years of progressive overload and eating at a surplus with a few cuts and breaks from weight training when I was travelling/busy with university. The last two years have been a bit rougher with less time in the gym and more time dedicated to other things. Progress has definitely slowed down and training volume has decreased but still a consistent part of my life. 

**LIFT PROGRESS SUMMARY**

Please note that most of these numbers were achieved at a higher bodyweight of around 183lb (83kg) to 193lb (88kg) and does not reflect my strength when cut down.

**Deadlift (Conventional):** 135lb (60kg) to 600lb (272.5kg)

**Deadlift (Sumo):** 135lb (60kg) to 645lb (292.5kg)

**Bench:** 88lb (40kg) to 353lb (160kg)

**OHP:** 45lb (20kg) to 243lb (110kg)

**Squat:** 135lb (60kg) to 474lb (215kg)

**PROGRAM**

As previously mentioned, training volume has dramatically decreased due to time constraints and life getting in the way now that I am older. I'd like to think that I am smarter with training these days and instead push each set a lot harder than I used to and make more use of it but I definitely still waste a lot of time fluffing around or chatting with friends at the gym. I am still running a Push Pull Leg Split although most weeks I will skip the second leg day for a extra rest day. I'd like to attribute this to the fact that squats have not felt great since having my ankle run over by a car when skating however I think I am just too lazy to work on the mobility etc needed to get my squat back up lol.

**Monday - Push 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x8-12 Flat Bench
* 4x8-12 Incline Dumbbell Bench
* 4x12-20 lateral raises
* 4x12-20 rear delt flies
* Tricep accessories vary

**Tuesday - Pull 01**

Example workout would be

* 10x10 body weight pull ups focusing on lats
* 4x8-12 single arm dumbbell rows
* 4x8-12 Lat pull down
* 4x8-12 chest supported row
* Bicep accessories vary

**Wednesday - Leg 01**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-8 squats
* 4x20 Walking Lunges
* 4x12 Leg Hamstring Curl
* 4x12 Leg Extension
* 4x12 Sissy Squats
* 4x12 Straight Leg/Romanian Deadlifts

**Thursday - Rest**

**Friday - Push 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x5-7 Overhead Press
* 4x12 Incline Barbell Press
* 4x12 Arnold/Shoulder press
* 4x12-20 Lateral Raises
* 4x12 Cable Flies Low to High and High to Low

**Saturday - Pull 02**

Example workout would be

* 4x4-8 Conventional Deadlifts
* 5x10 Pull ups (weighted)
* 4x8 Rowing movement
* 4x8 Lat pulldown
* Bicep accesories if there is time

**Sunday - Rest**

I still religiously do core every second day which consists of decline sit ups, dragon flags, hanging leg raises/windshield wipers.

As I mentioned, the last two years of training have not been ideal. Strength has not been a driving factor for training and I definitely could have made bigger improvements if I focused more. Unfortunately such is life and hobbies/passions cannot always be prioritized.

**COMEPETITION PREP**

Around July 2021, I decided that I needed some more motivation and that I was sick of going to the gym to just do the movements and make little to no progress. I approached my friend who competes in bodybuilding and decided that I would try my luck at a natural men's physique bodybuilding show set for mid November. 

Unfortunately one month into my competition prep my city went into Covid Lockdown and all gyms shut down (and are currently still closed). I was fortunate enough to act quickly and get a bunch of gym equipment to set up a home gym so my prep continued. However with covid spreading throughout the country, the shows looked less and less certain and the show I was intending to do has been postponed twice already. 

I decided that I would call off the competition prep three weeks ago as we are still in a lockdown and competition prep has been intruding on everyday life, work, and my relationship with my partner. 

See below photos for start of competition prep vs where I ended prep.

[Competition Prep Photos](https://i.imgur.com/clsIOMS.jpg)

**DIET**

Diet on competition prep vs everyday diet is very very different however I will list below what a typical day looked like on prep as it is a lot more structured. 

**Breakfast**

A mixture of Egg whites, Whole eggs, Protein Pancakes, Cereal, Milk, Toast, Peanut Butter, Protein Oats, and Fruit

**Lunch**

200g cooked chicken breast

200g Sweet Potato

150g steamed brocolli and beans

**Pre-Gym**

60-80g protein oats or something carby

**Dinner - Post Gym**

200g Rump Steak

400g Low Carb Potato

100g Steamed vege

Protein Shake

**Post Dinner**

200g Chicken breast

200g salad mix with balsamic vinegar dressing or something

Usually this adds up to about 2400-2600 calories depending on the day. 

When I wasn't on competition prep, things were a lot more flexible and I eat out a lot with my partner. I still meal prep weekly and make sure I eat about 60-70% of all my calories quite similar to the above competition prep diet. I generally eat between 3500-4000 calories to maintain a bodyweight of about 86kg/190lb. 

**END**

Thank you all for reading through all that lol and I also just want to thank this community for being so helpful when I first started lifting. I hope this post can help someone out there who is just starting/already into their journey. Feel free to send me a message or comment below with any questions and I will try my best to answer!

Now that I hopefully have earned a bit of your attention here is a rough breakdown of what you are getting into:

**Definitions and Concepts**: It’s not exciting but I want to start off by introducing my specific definitions for some terminology, as well as some overarching ideas that form the framework of what I am presenting. I hope that by covering this from the outset the whole post will make more sense and we can avoid silly arguments based on semantic differences and misunderstandings 

**Why you should pursue Strength Goals while Cutting**: This section will go into why I think that you should entertain the notion that cutting does not need to be a period of stagnation, and why you should be pushing for strength goals during this period rather than in periods of weight gain/bulking. 

**How to Structure Training under this Philosophy**: This section will cover some ideas on how to apply the ideas presented in the former section when building your long term training regimens. 

**A Detailed Look at my recent Cut**: Finally I will go into details on what I did on my most recent cut to give an example of the suggestions discussed in the previous section in action. 

Finally I want to add a note here before we start on who is an appropriate audience for this post. This information is ultimately aimed at more advanced lifters. This does not mean that I think the information contained is worthless for beginners or intermediates, but realize that some conditions and assumptions will not apply fully or at all to you. I encourage you to think about the ideas I present, either to pull select parts for your own use or just as something to stick in the back of your mind for when you are lifting at a higher level. This post is also aimed at general lifters who want the best of all worlds when it comes to strength, size, etc. If you are competing in a specific sport and what to dive fully into the aspects you compete in this might not fully apply to you. With that aside let’s start.
_____________________________________________________________________

**DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS**:

The first thing we need to get out of the way is what a cut is and what a bulk is in this context, and what the goals of each are.

 I am assuming here that a cut is a period of caloric deficit in which you are trying to maintain muscle mass while losing fat to a reasonable level. You are not trying to gain mass in any way while cutting, and you are not cutting to obscenely low body fat percentage. I won’t put a firm number on obscenely low but if you are trying to prep for bodybuilding competition or reach a similar level of leanness that is not a cut *in the context of this post*. 

I am assuming here that a bulk is a period of caloric surplus in which you are trying to build muscle mass. The amount of fat you do or do not gain is not really relevant, but I would expect you are gaining *some*. I want to reiterate that this is the only inherent goal of a bulk here, gaining mass, particularly muscle. No other goals that might be associated with bulks are relevant here. 


Next I want to distinguish the big difference between *gaining/building strength* and *demonstrating/showing strength*. In the simplest terms, building strength refers to developing your strength potential, and showing strength refers to demonstrating your strength potential. It is really easy to blend these together as they share the same name and are interconnected but I will try hard to distinguish them when writing this. 

When I refer to gaining strength, or strength potential, I am referring generally to the force production potential of your muscles and any other long term adaptations relevant to the lifts you care about. I encourage you to think of this as a static value, 100% of which would represent the most you could lift under ideal circumstances. 


When I refer to demonstrating strength I am referring generally to what you can actually lift on any given rep, once all the factors the influence that rep have been accounted for. Think of this as a percentile system based on your strength potential. On any given day you might be able to ‘show’ 84% of your potential. In this case if your potential was a 100lb lift you would be able to manage an 84lb lift *for that one specific rep*. 

Another important term along these lines is Strength Specificity, this is simply how well you can apply your muscles force production potential to perform a specific movement. Things like technical improvement, mental focus, etc improve your strength specificity in a given movement.  

_____________________________________________________________________

**WHY YOU SHOULD PERSUE STRENGTH GOALS WHILE CUTTING**

Now that the boring part is out of the way, let’s get into the meat of this post. The idea that I am presenting is that you should structure your training with the goal of reaching new strength related PRs while cutting, and not while bulking. To illustrate why I think training should be done this way I will present a few arguments/points. 

First off let’s look at what you need from your training during cuts and bulks to successfully reach the goal of the period, maintaining muscle mass and building muscle mass respectively: 

**The volume/overall stimulation needed to maintain muscle is much lower then it is to build new muscle.** This is a lesson I think a lot of new lifters, and some not so new lifters, need to learn and really internalize. Many people seem to have the notion that you need to fight *harder* to keep muscle when cutting than you do to gain muscle when bulking. This just is not accurate. To draw from personal experience I used to train similarly when cutting and bulking in terms of volume. This made cutting harder, and rather unpleasant. Then I ended up cutting through quarantine in the beginnings of my home gym, with only the basics (rack, power bar, bench, lightish DBs and pullup bar). The lack of options ended up with my cutting a good deal of the extra accessory work I would usually do when cutting, because frankly I did not like doing most of the movements I had access to. Well after 3 or so months I looked the best I had. No noticeable muscle loss despite chopping off a good deal of my volume from previous cuts.

**The fatigue levels you need when bulking are higher than what you need when cutting**. This is very closely tied to the previous point but the general idea is that you need to be maintaining a constant state of mild fatigue in order to grow. Continuing to push yourself despite incomplete recovery is what prompts the body to adapt, so that it can perform those actions without fatigue accumulation later. Now I want to be clear that I am suggesting you need a constant *mild* level of fatigue. You can absolutely over-do it and accumulate *too much* fatigue, this is not the goal and is also counterproductive. When cutting, you are not trying to promote adaptation of your muscles, so you do not need this steady level of fatigue. 

**The exercise selection needed when bulking is probably more expansive than when cutting**. Again, this ties closely into the last two ideas. In order to generate the stimulus that will create the fatigue in the muscles you want to grow you are probably going to want a wider spectrum of movements. You want to be able to keep pushing all your muscles to the proper limit, and not let weak links hold back stronger areas. This is why isolation work and variations are valuable and important to include in your bulking programming (I am purposely using the wishy washy words in this section, please don’t tell me how you really don’t need isolations in the comment section. I know, skin cats and whatever, I am speaking generally here). When cutting, you might not need as many of these isolations or variations as even when your main compounds are being limited by one muscle group you are still getting some stimulus to the stronger ones and that is probably enough. 

So now we know (or at least that I think) that bulking requires **higher volume, higher fatigue, and more varied exercise selection** and that cutting requires **lower volume, lower fatigue and less varied exercise selection**. Let’s take a look at what you need in your training to reach PR lifts (or at least to reach them more easily). 

To lift at your full potential and **display your strength** you generally want to include the following components: 

**Low Fatigue**: Fatigue, while very important in promoting hypertrophy (and strength *gain*) through adaptation, is not beneficial to demonstrating your potential. If your body is tired it is not performing at 100%. I think this is obvious, but will outright state it here both to be safe and because it’s a component of this argument. 

**Higher Frequency of the Lifts you care about**: This is another area where you could make a counter argument but generally speaking more time practicing a lift is going to improve your technique and increase your *specific strength* in that lift. This applies to all time frames. Years of constant practice will (or at least should) make you better at a lift, but a lot of practice in a short period really puts an extra honed edge on your technique for the duration (at least in my experience and the experiences of others I know).
Lower Overall Volume: this is mostly for the purpose of reducing fatigue, but I am stating it directly for the sake the argument. 


Now, if you are starting to see the picture I am trying to paint great, if not I will spell it out now. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals during a bulk are **directly opposed** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. The conditions needed to achieve your body composition goals when cutting are **permissive** to the conditions needed to promote PR lifts/display strength. To put it in other words, trying to program for PR lifts when bulking would impede your ability to develop muscles, but trying to program for PR lifts when cutting will not impede your ability to maintain it. 

It ultimately comes down to opportunity costs. Running PR programming when bulking would give you the very best results in terms of displaying strength, but would come at the cost of sacrificing muscle gain and ‘wasting’ your bulk. Running PR programming during a cut will give *slightly* (and I do mean this, I do not think you are sacrificing very much in the way of potential due to being in a caloric deficit) reduced results, but comes at no opportunity cost, as the PR programming meets the requirements for maintaining muscle mass. 

________________________________________________________________________

**HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR TRAINING**

Having covered the *why* of this kind of training, let’s take a general look at the *how*. 

If you want to summarize how you should be approaching training under this philosophy it should be like this: Bulking is for Building, Cutting is for Revealing. Your bulks should be structured with a focus on building muscle, building strength, and generally improving your potential. Cutting should be structured to focus on losing fat to reveal that muscle, and peaking your strength to reveal it in the form of PRs. 

**Bulking:** There are *a lot* of correct way to go about bulking. I am not going to go into too much detail about the how here. If you are a relatively advanced lifter you probably have a good idea of what kinds of programming you like and what is effective for you. If you aren’t then, like I said earlier, this post isn’t *really* for you but here are some programs to look into that I either have run and could support for this purpose or have heard enough good things about to safely suggest:

-nSuns 531LP/CAP3 

-531 Building the Monolith, BBB, or really any leader program (I think, I’m not really a scholar of 531)

-Deep Water Training (I should plug /u/MythicalStrength ‘s Mass Building program review where he ran a combination of 531/DW. Go read that if you want to know how to bulk good). 

-Average 2 Savage 2.0 or whatever it is called now. 

-John Meadows Stuff in general, more specifically Gamma Bomb. 

This is not an exhaustive list, go ask big and strong people what they ran to get big and strong. 

**Cutting:** This I will go into a bit more detail as it’s the part that is going to differ more from the norm than the bulking portion. Here you are going to want to choose or design programming that includes *lower volume* and *higher frequency* in whatever lifts you are trying to PR. I think the key here is you need to narrow in on, and pick one or two lifts that you want to try and grab PRs on. You can only have high frequency of so many things before you stop having low volume. I would suggest one or two lifts. If two, pick an upper and a lower. I would suggest really putting your focus during the cutting period on your compound lifts. You want to spread the stimulus around while conserving your energy so compounds are going to be very efficient for you. Keep your accessory work to a minimum. 

I am a big fan of two compound lifts a day, an upper and a lower, then accessories. If you choose something like this you would want to include maybe one pair of accessory movements after the main lifts, maybe 3-4 sets, that’s it. If you only want one compound a day you could have 3-4 accessory movements. But again, the goal here is to *maintain*. The extra work beyond that is mostly wasted on accessories, save it for putting more intensity into your focused main lifts. 

If you have a different method of peaking/honing strength feel free to use it obviously. I don’t have a very long list of programs that are suited for this but I could suggest looking at:

-[Simple Jack’d](https://reddit.com/r/SimpleJackd/comments/qj546t/previous_versions/), specifically the earlier versions with 1-2 focused lifts performed daily


-28 Free Program (Nuckols): using a 3 day plan for your chosen lift and one day of the others would probably get you pretty close to what you are aiming for. Make sure to customize the listed accessories a bit or you will end up with a lot of lower if you choose something like 3 Day Squat/1 Day Bench/1 Day Dead. 

**Cutting and Bulking Lengths:** 

I personally feel that this system works better with shorter, more frequent cycles, rather than the 6-9 months bulk/3 months cut before summer that is more common. I think that shorter periods are better *period* for more advanced lifters but that’s another topic. The reasoning for this is that while you can definitely grab PRs during a deficit, you are ultimately revealing strength potential you already have, not developing anything new. This means that once you peak up to that potential there really isn’t anywhere else to go. In my experience that is going to happen in the first 3-6 weeks. After that you can obviously keep cutting but you are losing out on the benefits of the system. By using shorter cuts and bulks you can have your body composition goals reached by the time you top out on your PRs and you can go right back on to building. 

If you are dead set on the longer cut and bulk periods I would suggest periodizing your cut. Pick a lift to focus on, get it up to PR, then back off on it and move on to focusing on another lift to get a PR on, repeat as needed until you are done with your cut. 

I should also mention that you should not be choosing the same lifts on back to back cut periods if you are using a shorter cycle approach. Say your bulks are 10-12 weeks. How much potential do you really think you built on a specific lift in that time period? The answer is not that much. Pick something you have not focused on in a while as it will have a bigger backlog of unrealized potential to tap into.

**How to Structure your Focused Lifts and When to PR:**

If you are trying to build up your own programming I am going to suggest what I use, and that is high frequency, up to every day, for your focused lift(s). What this is going to look like is probably 3-6 fairly easy days and 1-2 harder days per week.

 You want the easier days to be just that, easy, remember the goal is to *minimize fatigue* most of these days are just to accumulate technical practice to really fine tune your lifts. I recommend a ‘daily minimum* in terms of total reps and weight used and build up from that. I shamelessly stole this general idea from the Simple Jack’d programs. This means you might have a minimum of X reps at Y weight. You do this every session at least. If you aren’t feeling it during warm up its fine to just do this minimum and call it a day. Make it super easy and do it as X singles if you really want. Just get it done. If you *are* feeling it you can build up. Do X+5 reps at Y, or X reps at Y+20lbs, or X+3 reps at Y+15lbs, whatever. If you do build up things should still say pretty easy, if you are grinding reps you have gone too far. 

 You can plan for the harder days to be a specific day of the week or just take them when you feel like things are moving well. You can use a specific goal for the heavier days or just go in thinking “I’m going to see where I get to but I’m going to make sure it’s hard”. This system really is about self-regulation. If you suck at that maybe do something else. 

When it comes to deciding when you are going to PR you can plan it out or just go by feel. I mostly do the later. If you are moving your warmups and your first working set(s) super well and think it’s a good day to push then go for it. You could also go with using a planned ‘hard’ day as a PR day There are no wrong answers here. 

I will caution against a trap I constantly fall into and that’s rapid PR attempts. It’s easy to hit a PR that moved really well/better than expected and think you can totally do more the next day or the day after and grab another PR right away. You might, but really this is very counter-productive. PRs are very fatiguing, and every attempt, or failed attempt, is eating into your chances for another at some point in your cut. Unless you are at the end of your cut and just want to give it a shot because you are done after that either way give yourself a gap and a series of ‘easy’ days to shed fatigue and get yourself set up for another proper attempt. 

_______________________________________________________________________

**MY LAST CUT: AN EXAMPLE:**

My last cut lasted for ~5 weeks, I started in the 275lb range and ended in the 255lb range. Half of that is my regular water shift between deficit and surplus so I lost ~10lbs of actual mass. I cut on hard deficits because I do not find them very hard to maintain and they do not seem to hurt my progress. They allow me to get solid results in the short time-frames I allot for bulking. It’s also worth nothing that I am a giant (6’5”) with an enormous TDEE. I’m still consuming a lot of calories/nutrients when at a deep deficit. You might not have as much luck trying to copy the degree of this deficit if you are not large and highly active. I consume ~3500 calories when cutting and ~6000 when bulking. I have a rough overview of the specifics here:

>Here is my ~5.5-6k Bulking Diet (6'5"" ~265) 

>My 'core' diet which is all I eat while cutting is [here](https://imgur.com/a/3jhMs3z)

>That's ~3500 once you factor in sauces/condiments/all the other odds and ends I use for flavor. 

>When bulking I add the following: 

>2 servings of oats a day (300cal) 

>A snack mix consisting of Cheerios, dry fruits, and some nuts. I fill an old 2 gallon whey tub with it weekly and eat the entire thing over the course of the week. ~5.5k cal total, 790 cal a day. 

>A large jar of peanut butter a week, 6460/week, 920/day

>2 bags of popcorn chips and yogurt dip, 1700/week, 240/day. 

>Total/Day: 3500+ 300 + 790 + 920 + 240 = 5750/day plus whatever other odds and ends I might eat because I'm not restrictive about things like snacks at the office when bulking.

I actually underestimated the snack mix when I wrote that as I didnt have the bags at the time, its over 6000 total but you get the idea.

My cardio consists of a total of 6 miles walking with my dog daily and a 5000m row on my erg before dinner most nights. I do this when bulking and cutting. The 5k is not particularly high paced, I complete it with a 2:05-2:10/500m split average and watch TV while doing it. 

My training consisted of Log Press every day with a minimum of 205lb x 6. I went higher when I felt good and picked my PR attempts on the fly. I hit the higher rep PRs near the beginning of my cut and the low rep PRs at the end. I don’t have too much more to say about this it was almost entirely self-regulated and my goal for it was to improve my log press max and hit a bodyweight rep If I could, which I did do during the last week. I had a lot of success with this type of scheme for bench on my last cut, finally reaching 405lbs. I think I will keep using it for upper body lifts as long as it works. 

Two days a week I squatted low bar. These were just a few low rep sets at moderate intensity. My main goal for this lift was to get back into the habit (my last training block was entirely focused on front squats so I could hit my goal of 500lbs). I did not plan to PR on this lift but by the end things were moving so well I made the 545x3 PR when I decided to perform a single, hitting the double if it felt really good. After how well the second moved I decided to push for the 3rd and I think the 4th would have been a coin toss if I tried it. Based on that I felt pretty confident I could manage 605, which I did on the last week of the cut. I think that the fact I got two solid PRs despite no planning/specific training really speaks to how effective reducing your fatigue levels can be. 


Five days a week (the days I did not squat) I deadlifted. Deadlifts had the most structure of all my lifts. I decided to attempt a height progression training strategy in order to try and reach 585x20. I bought 12 .75” thick rubber paving tiles from a home improvement store. I stacked them up into 2 stacks of 6 (4.5”) to use as pulling blocks. Each week I pulled 5 reps of 585 from the blocks, and on the fifth day I pulled the set of 20. I then removed tiles from the stack each week, repeating the same day scheme at each height. The heights used were 6 tiles (4.5”), 5 tiles (3.75”), 3 tiles (2.25”) and no tiles (from the floor). I originally planned on a tile a week but I had a hard end time for this cut because I was flying out for a week to go to a wedding (I actually types this entire novel on the flights) and did not want to make the 585x20 from the floor attempt right before the trip in case it ended up tweaking something. I succeeded on every set and reached my goal of 585x20 from the floor in the 4th week. 

After this I stopped deadlifting. I was pushing for 600x20 all though my last bulk and never broke 15. 585x20 is roughly equivalent to 600x19 so it is still a huge jump. I actually really liked the height progression and will be using it in the future. I think it did a great job of letting me build up a lot of work at heavy weights while still keeping things in check fatigue wise. It also did wonders for building confidence in the lift. Knowing I *just* did the set of 20 last week from a slightly higher position made it very easy to hit the next one. It also taught me to grind even harder, I hit many reps that I probably would have called impossible before this block. 

My accessory work was preformed after the main work, and was very minimal. I used an Arms, Upper, Lower split for my accessory work, and had one day a week be a rest from accessory work. While I don’t think that the specific accessories are really at all relevant or helpful for me to list I will write out everything I remember because I assume someone will ask at some point. 

*Arms:* Double Single Handle Tricep Extensions/Bicep Curls, DB Incline seated curls, Dips, Cable Overhead Extensions and Rope/V bar push downs. I also did some Poundstone Curl sets and Poundstone Extension sets. 

*Upper:* Incline DB Hex press, Barbell bench press, SSB tricep/upper chest extension, Dips, Cable pulldowns, cable rows, SSB upper back row, Single arm ‘DB’ rows with a loaded kettleball handle, Trap Bar rows. 

*Legs:* Leg press, GHD curls, Calf raises

"I have never seen anybody except for obese people talk about walking as exercise on Reddit. I am curious for myself because I am obese (6'2 and 256) and I'm trying to walk an awful lot because I love it, but I don't do much else exercise.

I'm sure other forms of exercise are better for you (running would benefit you in cardio better, and lifting would benefit you in muscle tone better). But surely walking is much better than sitting on the couch.

What physical benefits does walking give you, and what distances are required to achieve any noticeable benefits?

And what are the differences, in terms of physical benefits, between different kinds of walking (pavement vs. rough, flat terrain vs. hiking up a mountain)?

"Hello /r/fitness. 

I just wanted to share my progress over the past two years. 

First up progress pic: [April of 2019 to July 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2OPpRvH.png)

Currently I am M/28/6'0""/184lbs. When I started this journey back in 2019 I was a super skinny fat 170lbs. 

I had always been the super skinny weak kid growing up. [Me at 24 vs 28](https://i.imgur.com/L0hKsjL.png) 

Early on in my training I think I maxed out my bench at around 95-100lbs. I had literally no strength or sports background, so it was literally starting from square one. 

My goal in posting this, is to maybe give some people hope that don't have a background in sports or strength training at all. I fucked up many times in this process, but everything was a learning experience and I feel like I am constantly getting better. It just takes time. 

Below are my lift progressions, all in pounds.

&nbsp;

| Lift       | Before      | After       |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| Bench      |          95|     275
| Squat  |    215|  [405](https://streamable.com/1eyay8) 
| Deadlift      |        225|   465


Unfortunately I don't have video of the other two from my mock powerlifting meet earlier this year.
&nbsp;

**So, what all did I do?**

Well the first I went to therapy for my depression in 2019. My therapist required me to hit the gym, and be active. I work as a software developer and love playing video games and whatnot, so my activity level was basically zero. I would eat like garbage and drink tons of soda. 

I started going to the gym and was running *Shortcut to Shred* by Jim Stoppani at the recommendation of a friend. I kind of had fuck-around-itis the entire time, never kept track of weights. But the important thing was I started building the habit. The gym I was going to didn't really have a decent barbell setup, so eventually I switched gyms and programs. I hadn't made a ton of progress at that time. 

I had no idea what I was doing with my diet, and while I made decent strength gains at the time, I didn't really make any visible aesthetic progress.

That's when I found out powerlifting existed and I fell in love with it/switched to a large gym with lots of oly lifting platforms. All I wanted to do was progress on the big 3, and progress I did. My lifts shot up(comparative to where I was) and I was finally able to get a 135lbs bench. It was a HUGE milestone for me. 

I trained exclusively with powerlifting programs for a while, got into the 1000lbs club and hit the milestones I wanted to. I got lucky and built a homegym literally 3 months before the pandemic hit, so I was set for that.

Most of my lifting was done in 3-5 rep range, and I was benching squatting and deadlifting 2-3x per week. Very little accessories.

But around the start of 2021 I realized I looked like DYEL. My arms were small, my shoulders much much larger than my biceps. I had too much bodyfat. You couldn't even see my muscles I had spent time building. Yeah I could bench 255-265 at the time, I could squat almost four plates, but it wasn't really visible.

[Look at this beefcake greek god](https://i.imgur.com/oQZbUUK.png)

So I got frustrated and phoned it in for a while. My diet fell off the rails and I just coasted through the little workouts I would do. 

Around 4 months ago I got back on the wagon, dialed in my diet and started slamming actual bodybuilding workouts. 

After years of doing PPL, 5/3/1, Hybrid Powerlifting, GCZL and other programs, I swapped to a fully bro split bodybuilding program. Which Reddit can't stand. But it really got me passionate about lifting again. The pumps were INSANE. 

&nbsp;

I am currently running Gamma Bomb by John Meadows and seeing great progress.
&nbsp;

The split is split up into five days:

Day 1: Back + abs + calves

Day 2: Chest + Shoulders

Day 3: Legs

Day 4: Arms + Abs + Calves

Day 5: This day is a dedicated pump day. In the first 6 weeks it is upper body pump day, and in the second 6 weeks it is a lower body day.

John Meadows loves cluster sets and drop sets, and the program increases in volume every week for 6 weeks until you deload. 

In week 1 you are doing anywhere from 18-25 sets in a workout, by week 6 the hardest week has up to 38 sets. It is BRUTAL, but if you love training to failure and a bro split, I cannot recommend the program enough. The other thing with Meadow's programs, they are never the same week to week. He keeps things really fresh and mixes up the exercises every week. This can be a little hard to gauge progress on sometimes, but since you are using Reps in Reserve and training to failure often, it is a plus for me. 

&nbsp;

 I am on a slight bulk of about 250 calories, currently eating around 2900 per day. I don't track my macros, but I religiously tracked for about a year, so I have decent expectations of portion sizes. 

A day of eating currently looks like:

Greek Yogurt + 4 eggs and some vegetables for breakfast.

Protein Shake.

Lunch - 40-60g of protein in a lean meat(usually chicken), along side a carb like rice or potatoes + some onions and peppers.

I eat a meal preworkout, usually a banana alongside my preworkout supplement for energy.

Another protein shake

And then for dinner I eat BIG. Me and my wife cook dinner together every night. It is usually fajitas, shrimp pasta, steaks, or anything else protein heavy and filling.

I have completely cut out soda, and milk(I used to drink 4-5 glasses a day), and I feel myself getting leaner and more vascular all the time. 

As far as how I got to my current macros, It has just been a lot of fine tuning over the past year. I would watch the scale religiously and adjust up or down, all while making sure I got enough protein. I try to eat 1.2g per lbs of bodyweight at all costs.

&nbsp;

The other big thing was I got my T checked around the start of this year. I went to an endo out of curiosity, and I ended up having sub 300 T levels. This is REALLY REALLY low, which my endo says explains my size/weight before and my depression and other symptoms I was having. I got on a mild T booster and got myself back up to a healthy level with my doctors help, and it has been a game changer as far as energy and mental health goes. 

What's next? I'm going to keep grinding and focus on aesthetics and bodybuilding. I hit a 4 plate squat, I am over caring about the numbers I put up. I just want to feel good and look good, and get over this body dysmorphia. 

I feel like my arms/chest/calves REALLY need some growth, so I will focus on that on the caloric surplus, and then probably try to cut down 10-15lbs.

I'll finish it off with a few more progress pics

"Hi Everybody!

Today I want to showcase a physical training app that is available for both [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boostcamp-training-programs/id1529354455) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmhealth.boostcamp&hl=en_US&gl=US).

[Boostcamp.](https://www.boostcamp.app/)

First, I’ll tell you why this app has impressed me. They’re one of two developers to have contacted me and asked me about my programs before releasing them on their app. Because I have published many free training programs, there are many free options out there for apps that include them. However, not all are created equally – which is why I am impressed with Boostcamp.

In chatting with the development team, I have helped them add a GZCLP progression to Boostcamp, which has notable lifters like Greg Nuckols and Jonnie Candito on the team.

Boostcamp has many programs available, including: nSuns 5/3/1, Nuckols’ Beginner Program, PHUL, Reddit PPL, and Candito’s 6 Week, and quite a few others.

I am stoked that GZCLP has been added to their app. Even more so that the app does a good job of adding flexibility and many options to personalized GZCLP to suit your needs.

This means that when you run GZCLP on Boostcamp you will be able to:

Determine your training days by days of the week. This is also displayed in a neat calendar view that shows what days you trained on, providing easy review of your own training history. (Currently 4-days per week is supported in the beta, a 3-day schedule is in the works.)

Units and weight rounding. Supports both Freedom Units and Kilograms and allows for rounding to the smallest weight plate available. So if you have access to 1.25 lbs. micro plates, then go for it.

Update weights and reps. Meaning if you’ve made a bigger increase in weight than called for, perhaps because last week you noticed it was too easy, you can make that change on the fly.

Same goes for your reps. Last set rep outs (+ sets) are accounted for. This is a major function of how GZCLP progresses, so to have this be straightforward and easily tracked is huge.

Additional exercises can be added. Say you want to do more pressing on Day 2, you can add that – or another variety – using a convenient drop-down list. This is for your T2 and T3 exercises.

After completing a week of workouts, the app populates the next week for you.

After a workout you can provide a rating and feedback, noting what went right, wrong, or otherwise.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Boostcamp also provides community support! There’s a chatroom for the individual program where you can help others also running the program and get help from those same people.

Additionally, should you want to support the program creator, such as yours truly (or perhaps Greg Nuckols, or Jonnie Candito), you can! I am thankful for every donation I get from you all via PayPal, which is linked in my blog, but that Boostcamp provides this option for those content creators is greatly appreciated. In my opinion, it is important simply for recognizing the work of those that created the training programs, who without the app would not be as good!

Please check out Boostcamp, especially if you’re running a 4-day version of GZCLP. I am sure it will help you streamline your progress and make easier the tracking of your training history.

Have a fantastic day,

Cody (GZCL)",fitness
"**Does anyone know much about these recommended DB-only programs and can give a quick overview of potential pitfalls between each one? Goals: fat loss. Also, how to assess if you're a beginner? I'm unsure if I should be looking at beginner only routines. Thanks in advance!**

**Concerns:**

\- Is 3 day total body workouts enough albeit seems recommended for true beginners? I can't tell if I'm a beginner since I have lifting experience and I run daily (lol). I haven't been on a regular lifting regimen in over a year but I do circuit style lifting and some interval runs with sprints mixed In.

\- Programs not adjusted for fat loss. I want to build muscle, but I need to lose fat first or else I'll be having muscle underneath the layer of fat.

\- Too much rest time in between working the same muscle group. Ie,  some PPL programs work the legs/glutes with 4 days of rest days in between, which seems to be a waste since 48 hours is deemed as optimal.

\- There is much more emphasis on upper body than lower

This program is what I'm most likely going to do. However, he said that this program isn't ideal for fat loss. I'm confused as to why and how to modify it?

    **Workout A**
    Split Squat 3x8 (each leg)
    Bench 3x8 (If you don’t have a bench do floor press)

    **Workout B**
    Walking Lunge 3x8 (each leg)
    Overhead Press 3x8
    Romanian Deadlift or Straight Leg Deadlift 3x8 (Use single leg version when you max out your weight)
    Lat Pulldowns or Pull/Chin ups (Once you reach 3x8 begin adding weight)

PPL version is a potential 2nd choice due to the different exercises. However, I'm not too sure about PPL split and back-to-back Push + Pull seems hard on the upper body. It does seem to be upper body heavy and not enough glute... and legs are worked out with 3 days of rest in between rather than 48 hours.

    **Push**

"#[Link to Article](http://www.lookgreatnaked.com/blog/what-is-the-best-method-of-cardio-for-fat-burning/)

In this blog post from Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, he summarizes a recent meta-analysis his team performed comparing HIIT and moderate intensity exercise on fat loss:

[Slow and Steady, or Hard and Fast? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Comparing Body Composition Changes between Interval Training and Moderate Intensity Continuous Training](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/11/155/htm)

He notes a previous meta-analysis came to a different conclusion but has since been retracted after several oddities were found.  (Which, as an aside, [seems to be a thing](https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/17/exercise-researcher-earns-more-retractions-as-investigations-mount/) plaguing Brazilian research lately.)  

The new paper is open source and worth a read, but Brad sums it up nicely by saying:

"Hello all,

I looked all over for a spreadsheet of a (free) program Paul Carter outlined some years ago but couldn't find one, so I made one! I'm not very good at google sheets/excel so if you have any tips feel free to let me know. I've included the article Paul wrote and the link to the google sheet that you can make a copy of to edit yourself.

I found the article's tips very helpful and having run the program through once a year ago I got my OHP up to 135. I'm going to run it again soon and try to get up to 175.

" [Reading the cardio thread that was recently posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/oftc49/calories_burned_vs_effort/), I noticed a bunch of myths and misconceptions related to cardio being continually regurgitated and upvoted. It was a painful read. So I decided to make this thread to dispel them.  And yes, I checked the Wiki and didn’t see any of these myths or misconceptions mentioned. And if they were, they must have been buried somewhere and read by no one given how frequently they were spewed and upvoted in the linked thread above. 

It’s a long read, so here’s a table of contents of the 5 myths and misconceptions (all of which were parroted and upvoted multiple times in the linked thread) that I will be addressing for those who don’t want to read through the whole thing:

1) HIIT burns more calories than steady state.

2) But muh efficiency!!!!

3) X cardio is better than Y cardio for fat loss!!!

4) Lifting weights burn more calories than cardio because it raises your metabolism!

5) You can’t outrun a bad diet. 

&#x200B;

**1) HIIT burns more calories than steady state.**

No, HIIT does not burn more calories than steady state cardio when done for the same amount of time, in fact, it’s the opposite, for the simple reason that in any given time you can cover a greater distance properly pacing yourself (ie. running at a steady state) than doing it HIIT style.  

“But I read a study”... You can easily make your own study with a sample size of 1:

Go to the gym, hop on a treadmill or a stationary bike, and go at a decent steady state pace for 30 minutes (and by decent pace, I mean actually try). How much distance did you cover? How many calories did the machine say you burned? 

Now, on another day, hop on the same piece of equipment and do the same 30 mins but HIIT style... How much distance did you cover? If you didn’t go at a bitch pace during your SS session, answer will be: much less. How many calories did the machine say you burned... Once again, the answer will be: much less. I’m not saying that the calorie counters on machines are completely accurate (they’re not), but if the machine says you burned 300 calories more on one day than another, then you probably burned more calories on that day than the other, perhaps not 300 more, but you probably burned more calories regardless. 

As mentioned, steady state cardio is more effective than HIIT for burning calories for the simple reason that you can cover MUCH more distance doing an exercise at a steady state than you can doing that same exercise HIIT style. If the opposite were the case, you would see all those 10+km runners at the Olympics sprinting/walking, sprinting/walking etc... They don’t do it, because that would be stupid. And no, it doesn’t matter that you “felt more tired” after doing 1.5K of interval sprints in 30 minutes than you did after a 5K jog in 30 minutes. At the end of the day, you covered more distance during the 5K jog in the same amount of time, and thus, you did more work and burned more calories. This is basic thermodynamics, and whatever study you find that says otherwise is flawed.

And no... EPOC (ie. the AFTERBURN!!111) from HIIT is negligible. You are not burning double the calories lying in bed browsing Reddit after your HIIT workout. Let’s not go there. 

&#x200B;

**2) BUT MUH EFFICIENCY!!!!**

Probably the most aggravating of the cardio myths and misconceptions, it’s not that it’s completely untrue, but the conclusions that people derive from it are not only wrong, but detrimental in the sense that it discourages people from doing cardio in fear of becoming “too efficient at it.” Do you really think that you can burn more calories than Lance Armstrong on a 2 hour bike ride because he’s “adapted to it” and you’re “inefficient”? Even though he can cover 20x the distance? But muh inefficiency!!!! 

There is a lot of debate about how efficient you can get depending on the exercise, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. It just means that you can cover the same distance with fewer calories and a lower RPE. So what can you do to get around this? You can simply increase your RPE back to where it was before. So your RPE and calories burned stay the same, but you cover more distance. HOORAY... You’re getting BETTER!

But even if you can get more efficient at an exercise, the vast majority of your progress is still going to come from physiological adaptation. What does this mean? It means that you can go faster, for longer, BURN MORE CALORIES and do all this with a lower RPE. It means that your 30mins/300 calorie run where you were dying at the end turns into a 30mins/500 calorie run where you barely broke a sweat. It means that waking up sore the next day turns into waking up and not feeling a thing even though you covered more distance in less time. 

Tour de France bike riders must be pretty damn efficient at bike riding considering they’re the elite of the elite... They’re so efficient that they must burn like 100 calories during a single ride amirite? Regardless of how efficient they are, they still consume [8,000 calories a day](https://www.outsideonline.com/2100086/day-food-tour-de-france) on average. Do you really think that they’d burn more calories on the stair stepper because they’re less efficient at it? Does that even make sense?

Now for a more scientific answer... Specializing in a specific type of cardio will increase the amount of [myoglobin and mitochondria in the muscles used in that exercise](https://www.issaonline.com/blog/index.cfm/2018/mitochondrial-adaptations-to-aerobic-training#:~:text=The%20overall%20density%20of%20mitochondria,in%20myoglobin%20in%20muscle%20tissue.). The jist of it is myoglobin stores oxygen in the muscles and sends it to the mitochondria in those same muscles which use that oxygen to produce energy (ie burn calories). The more of both you have in your muscles (and the bigger your mitochondria) , the more energy those muscles can produce and the more calories they can burn. 

Changing over to another cardio exercise that you’re less efficient at will mean that you will be using new muscles that are untrained, which will have fewer myoglobin and mitochondria, and thus will not be able to produce as much energy (ie. burn as many calories) as those muscles you use in the exercise that you’re “efficient” at. The end result isn’t that you’d be burning more calories.... Unless it’s a sprint, you’d be burning FEWER calories while getting MORE tired in the process. 

This is not to say that cardio exercises don’t transfer over from one to the other... They do. Cardio increases your heart’s ability to pump blood regardless of the exercise. So a trained cyclist will be better at running than someone who is untrained thanks to the higher cardiac output they’ve attained from cycling. They just won’t be as good at running as they are at cycling due to the aerobic capacity of the muscles not being as trained for that specific exercise. But no, this doesn’t mean they will burn more calories from running because they’re “not efficient at it.” In fact, it means the opposite. 

&#x200B;

**3) X cardio is better than Y cardio for fat loss.**

Calories in, calories out. It doesn’t matter which one burns more fat, it matters which one burns more CALORIES!!! 

To demonstrate this lets take an overly simplistic example... 

Exercise A burns 100% glycogen, 0% fat. 

Exercise B burns 0% glycogen, 100% fat. 

You eat after exercise A at maintenance.... Your glycogen stores are depleted. All the carbs you eat go towards replenishing your glycogen stores with none of it being stored as fat. 

You eat after exercise B at maintenance.... Your glycogen stores are full (since no glycogen was used during your workout). None of the carbs you eat go towards replenishing your glycogen stores since they’re already full. So what will your body do with those carbs? It will turn them all into fat. So after you’ve eaten the net effect between exercise A and exercise B when it comes to fat loss... Is zero. 

So whether a workout burns more glycogen or more fat, if your goal is fat loss, it doesn’t matter. If you want to lose fat, you need a calorie deficit, and to that end, the more effective cardio workout will be the one that burns more CALORIES. 

“But I’ll just do a bunch of cardio and not eat carbs... Problem solved”!!!! <--- Don’t do that, your body needs glycogen. You will feel like shit and your cardio gains will suffer, and cardio gains = burn more calories.  

&#x200B;

**4) Lifting weights burn more calories than cardio because it raises your metabolism.**

While lifting weights does raise your metabolism... [One pound of muscle burns 6 to 7 calories a day.](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-many-calories-does-muscle-really-burn-1231074) Sure, those calories can add up if you put on some serious muscle. But the amount of calories burned from muscle is still overstated. If you want to find a counter source that says this isn’t true, and that a pound of muscle burns 100 calories a minute... I don’t care, since I’m about to put the cardio vs. weight lifting for calorie burning debate to rest either way... 

Again...  There's a reason why Tour de France cyclists [consume 8000 calories a day](https://www.outsideonline.com/2100086/day-food-tour-de-france) on average yet are built like twigs. That's over 2500 calories more per day (the TDEE of an entire human) than what [Ronnie fucking Coleman ate in his prime.](https://fitnessvolt.com/ronnie-coleman-diet/)

I’m sorry, but nobody can claim that lifting weights burns more calories than cardio when these 140 pound Tour de France cyclists would view the bulking diets of the world’s top body builders as starvation diets. Yes, you can increase your RMR and TDEE from lifting weights and your body does use calories to repair muscle tissue, but even when taking that into account, when it comes to exercising for weight loss, SS cardio is still king and it’s not even close.  

**5) “You can’t outrun a bad diet.”**

I hate this saying because of how people interpret it... You can’t outrun a bad diet... So don’t run at all because it’s pointless. 

First of all, if you read above you would know by now that there are people who CERTAINLY CAN outrun a bad diet and then some, but that’s because they put in the work. You can’t... because you haven’t. But you can still get better. The more cardio you do, the better you get at it, the more calories you will burn from it, the more you can mitigate the detrimental impacts of a bad diet, the more calories you can consume on a good diet and the lower the impact cheat days will have. 

So if you do have a bad diet... You’d be putting yourself in a much better position at least TRYING to outrun it. And who knows, after you put enough work into it... Maybe you’ll be able to! (Disclaimer... I do promote having a bad diet... Put the fork down fatty! But do cardio too).

**In summary**

SS cardio is great... Should you do it? Absolutely!

But if you don’t want to, that’s fine too. But DON’T use these myths and misconceptions as self-justification for not doing it and certainly DON’T spread these myths and misconceptions to others. All that does is discourage others from bettering themselves and putting in the work that you’re not willing to do.

"I'm assuming everyone's primary reaction is going to be instantly to say buy a rack, barbell, weights instead, although the cost of that also adds up to about $2000-$4000 range. 

I'm specifically wondering if you think tonal can be used to build muscle since it's method of resistance is different from free weights and more similar to cables or resistance bands. 

The features seem pretty cool, specifically the chains and eccentric mode which apply add and reduce weight as during concentric and eccentric phases of the reps which I felt were better than free weights.

Personally, I doubt that it's worth the money since there are cheaper home gym alternatives but if tonal were to get cheaper in the next few years, do you think the level of convenience it provides may be worth the money?",fitness

"Hey all! For reference, I am a squash player. The length of the ""track"" is 10meters so every 10m i need to turn the sled around. So one ""round"" is 10m

I have been experimenting for 3 weeks with the sled push. Since I train legs 3x a week, that means a total of 9 sessions with it. Trying out different weights, distance and rest periods. My primary goal is to increase accelaration and my secondary goal is to increase leg endurance, espeicially for squash. My experience with it, I love it. It feels great and I think it is a decent exercise combining regular squats, box jumps and lunges. 

My problem is that Im not sure how to program this movement. I have thought it through and I think I can do 2 heavy days and one lighter day. The heavy days being two rounds of max effort, and the lighter days would be a bit longer perhaps 6-10rounds. The heavy days having the goal of increasing acceleration and the lighter day more of an endurance builder.  If you ask why I chose those distances, yes I pulled them out from my ass. 

So my question is, do  you program this on max distance covered in a x amount of time, or a predetermined distance fastest as possible? If you think the former, then for how many minutes if the goal is acceleration and for how many minutes for endurance? And if you think the latter, then how far should the distance on the heavy days and on the lighter days. 

Follow up questions, should i also include reverse sled pulls? Like instead of pushing, you go backwards.


Tl;dr: how to program sled push

Edit 2: After reading the comments I will adding the sled push to build leg endurance and not speed. I will be cheking the sprint subreddit for that",fitness
"Alright, I'm going to try to keep this as objective as possible, so bear with me. I'll put this in the beginning just to get it out of the way: 

[Start](http://imgur.com/a/gTJtyqL) / [3 Months](http://imgur.com/a/AdqKRNv) / [6 Months](http://imgur.com/a/BP3SrIG) 

Some older background: Luckily for myself, I've always been fairly athletic and played a bunch of sports growing up, including baseball, football, and basketball. I had never really considered my weight an issue, as I felt I was fairly muscular because I played sports. 

Some newer background: Right before this, I was drinking somewhere between 3-6 beers a day. I was also only eating maybe two meals a day. Pair that with a super fast metabolism, and you get overly underweight and a lose of strength. 

One day, I decided to buckle down, cut drinking cold turkey, eat more, and change for the better. 

I had some previous gym experience freshman year of college and some from a little bit before covid, so I felt somewhat comfortable trying to get back into the swing of things. I used some of what I knew previously, as well as looking thru the fitness wiki and this subreddit, to decide on what routine I'd get myself into. Ultimately, I decided to use the program listed in this post here: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). 

I decided on a PPL split only because that's what I used to do before, it's what I felt most comfortable with, and I couldn't figure out the difference between all the other splits with the information overload. I adapted some of it to fit some of the workouts I wanted to include, and it's changed over time. Listed below are what I started with (with weights) and what I'm currently at (with weights). One disclaimer: I did end up switching gyms, so some of the weights don't translate properly. I don't understand why at different gyms or between different equipment, some weight numbers mean different things on different machines, but it is what it is.

All x2, Every Other Day 

So yeah, there's that. I usually do this six days a week, barring any outside circumstances. 

As for my diet, that's a strange thing. I'm the type of person that is perfectly content with eating the same three meals, every day, with minimal effort in making all three. People make fun of me all the time, but it is what it is. The schedule of my job doesn't really allow me to cook dinner often either. I try and eat things that are cheap, high in protein, and high in calories. If I can get all three of those things, I'm happy with eating it. With that, my daily meal and snack list is the same. Same bowl of cereal for breakfast, same turkey sandwich for lunch, same frozen pasta bowls for dinner. Listed below in the link are screenshots of all three meals and a snack, as well as the nutritional content of what I get throughout the day. I know I probably eat too much protein and maybe sodium. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know. 

[Diet](http://imgur.com/a/Sg0sZc8) 

Other things to include:  
- In the past month and a half, I've started to use pre-workout. I personally use Pre-Jym.  
- In the past month or so, I've started to use creatine. 

Main things I've learned:  
- Form is most important (given).  
- Breathing control is second most important (basically, to me).  
- Eating more and better really did make a world of difference.  
- You can surprisingly go up in weight wayyyy quicker in the beginning than I thought. 

Things I'm working on:  
- Mainly incorporating deadlifts into my routine. Thinking about first exercise on my pull day before barbell rows. Would remove back raises.  
- Trying to focus on my chest. Always been the weakest part of my body. Not exactly sure how to be more dynamic and really hit it hard. 

Things holding me back:  
- From three to six months, I feel like I've had minimal visible change. I've increased in weight a decent bit in some areas. Am I plateauing? (hence use of pre-workout and creatine).  
- For the last few weeks to months, I've had progressively worse left golfer's elbow tendinitis. I've been working to reduce the root cause of it while increasing the stretching of my wrist/forearm area. I have been working thru it currently (although it's probably not recommended).  
- My right shoulder is weird. Overuse of throwing a baseball (possibly incorrectly) when I was younger has caused it. Kinda feels like it pops a lot. Kinda feels painful at times. Kinda seems like rotator cuff, but really not. I don't think it is. Who knows. 

But yeah, ultimately that's my progress, journey, and guide to where I'm at now. I'm open to suggestions on any aspect of what I've done so far, whether it be focus exercises or dietary changes, so please let me know! Thank you all very much.

Edit: Reddit is a very weird place man. I'm very jaded when it comes to this post now. I woke up this morning to a TON of people telling me I wasn't underweight and basically shitting on me. First off, my bad. I don't periodically check my BMI. I haven't done that since they make you do it in high school. Plus, what else am I exactly supposed to reference for being underweight? I don't ask other people for their weights and to see them with their shirts off. In my mind, I was underweight. For that, I guess I apologize for being wrong for something I didn't even know about. If I could edit the title, I would. I'm jaded because I've seen this sub help a lot of people, I've asked questions in it and looked for help, and I've seen people make some great progress too. I was surprised when I made a lot of progress, so I thought I'd share because I figured it could help others too. But a part of me wants to say screw it and delete the whole post altogether because people are getting mad over me not knowing I wasn't underweight. What's the point of trying to be positive when every comment is shitting on you for an uneditable title? I don't know what else to say.",fitness

"Hi all!

Just looking for a bit of advice really.

I’ve been off and on with gyms for the past few years and then when covid hit, really got back into going to the gym again, messy breakup, big focus on myself!

My new partner is really into CrossFit, so I thought I would give it a go, and fell in love aswell. My main concern about a standard gym was me not actually taking the time and effort to do any cardio, having asthma I was always scared too, but doing this has pushed me out of my comfort zone.

Anyway, the coaches have great WODs programmed in and do to Oly session on the weekends. But I really miss doing some good old strength training to go alongside it. I was doing a PPL at the time, but the CrossFit gym doesn’t have all the same equipment so I thought I would just focus mainly on the CrossFit and metcon. 

Now I want to get my strength back to similar/better level so I’ve been looking at strength programs again, but I don’t want to spend hours in the gym as each class with the warm up is roughly 45/60 mins. 

Can anyone help or may if had a similar situation in the past and what they did to have CF and a strength program side by side? I was looking at simple 5/3/1 but wasn’t too sure if it was enough.

Thanks all!

"I'm looking for advice, ideas or experiences about strength training with one hand. Due to an injury several years ago I had my main wrist flexor tendon sheath (FCR) released surgically 3 years ago and I'm basically left with a painful right hand that flares up badly with tight gripping or flexion under load (push ups are bad news). Prior to the injury and surgery several years ago I lifted weights regularly for many years and loved it. I felt it kept me health mentally and physically. Since the injury I've lost about 30 lbs of muscle, most of my clothes are baggy now and I just dearly miss exercising. I've accepted where I'm at with the hand and I want to move forward with this new limitation. I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to get back into strength training and am looking for any ideas at all; most/all of my old basic gym lifts are not doable anymore.

I have done some looking via Google and on this subreddit, but I haven't found anything very definitive.  Thus far I have been trying some body weight exercises (mostly one legged squats, unweighted lunges and core work), Pilates, some modified yoga/DPPY yoga (I made a roughly elbow height platform that I can rest my forearms on for downward dog etc). This has been better than nothing, but I really miss lifting weights (or body weight) and strength training. I realize I'm unlikely to put on large amount of muscle with one hand, but I'd really like to recover some of my lost muscle mass and/or get that great feeling you get after a hard workout. Has anyone done strength training one handed or know of anywhere that I might find more information? It doesn't have to be classic strength training. I'm very open to any type of exercise type or program, I just miss the feeling of being tired after a good workout. Getting stronger would be a huge bonus though.

Edit: Thank you for all of the input and motivation. Super helpful. I'm going to try some of this and get back in the gym and just experiment.

[Before and after pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/1qfkqUg) Too be honest these aren't the best pictures to represent this. I was never going for looking bigger, just being stronger. I never thought to take a proper before/after picture because of this. So, yeah this is as close as it's going to get! (And to be honest I think the front squat PR video gives you a decent idea of body size change!)

**The template I followed after 531 BBB (I call it 531 x 365, with actual credit of the title coming from** u/3pIcenTer\*\*):\*\*

531 has so many templates and I’m stubborn. So I made up my own. It’s very basic and anyone with a basic understanding of 531 programming should get the idea of it. Without going into it too much, 531 usually has 3 main sets followed by 5 supplemental sets. Not always, but that’s the pattern that most templates follow.

I wanted something that mimicked a cycle of volume, followed by a cycle of intensity, and worked up to a yearend total. (Approximately a year, a little less than that) So I present to you the 531 template that you can run for almost an entire year. Once it’s over, retest your maxes, enter a new TM (if it’s lower than the current, always use the lower number) and then repeat over and over until you die.

I call it 531 x 365. (Get it, because you can do it all year) I used a 90% TM, but if I were to repeat it I would probably use a 85%. Maybe even an 80%.

**How it works:**

Supplemental work changes every cycle, main work follows traditional 531 programming. Supplemental work is always based off of the increased TM. I chose to increase all of my TM’s by 5 pounds except for my OHP which I increased by 2.5 pounds a cycle.

**Cycle 1: Volume**

4 day split, OHP, Squat, Bench, Deads each having their own day. Preferably rest day after two days on, then 2 more days on, then 2 rest days. Works great as a Monday, Tuesday, off on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, off on the weekend schedule. Do what you have to do though.

Cycle 1 focuses on volume for the supplemental work. Do your 3 main sets and then your supplemental sets will look like this.

* 5 sets of 12 reps of 45% of your TM. Repeat this same weight for the entire cycle for your supplemental work.

**Cycle 2: Intensity**

Supplemental work done as:

* 5 sets of 6 of 75% of your TM

**Cycle 3: Volume**

* 5 sets of 11 at 50% of your TM

**Cycle 4: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 5 at 80% of your TM

**Cycle 5: Volume**

* 5 sets of 10 at 55% of your TM

**Cycle 6: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 4 at 85% of your TM

**Cycle 7: Volume**

* 5 sets of 9 at 60% of your TM

**Cycle 8: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 3 at 90% of your TM

**Cycle 9: Volume**

* 5 sets of 8 at 65% of your TM

**Cycle 10: Intensity**

* 5 sets of 2 at 95% of your TM

**Cycle 11: Volume**

* 5 sets of 7 at 70% of your TM

**Cycle 12: Test Maxes or Do TM test, adjust to the lower TM and start over from the beginning.**

By lower TM I mean the following:

You start with a TM of 200 on bench press. After 12 cycles your TM is now 260. When you test your maxes you find out that your actual max for bench is actually 260. Using the 90% TM means the new TM you would use is now 235.

In a different example, you started with a 200 pound TM on bench, but when you test your new max you actually bench 300. This would suggest that your new TM should be 270, but stick with the 260.

Stick with the lower number and you’ll have less chances of getting stuck. What do you do if you get stuck? Follow normal 531 protocol. I never stalled on this programming.

**Accessories:**

Do what 531 programming suggest or do your own thing. I did my own thing and had great success with it.

I reached my strongest point by doing the following for accessories.

1. Find a TM for your accessory just like you would a main lift. Either max out or find a top set of 3-5 where you couldn’t do more reps. Then take a 90% of that to get a TM.
2. Take your TM and take 70% of that and 50% of that.
3. Do 3 sets at 70% of your TM like this: 5, 5, 5+
4. Do 2 sets at 50% of your TM like this: 10, 10
5. Keep the same weight for the entire cycle and just try to beat your + set
6. If you could get all of the minimal reps on all 5 sets (at least 5 on the 3rd set) then increase the weight by the smallest amount possible. If it’s a machine that goes up by 2.5 pounds then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a bar that you can put 2.5’s on either side then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If it’s a machine that you can add 10 pounds to as the minimal number then that’s what you’ll increase it by. If you can’t complete the reps then either lower the weight or repeat the weight next cycle.

**My bench day accessories:**

* Row, lateral raises, close grip bench (giant superset thingy)

**OHP day:**

* Weighted dips, Chest flys/superset with reverse flys, rows

**Deadlift day:**

* Lat Pulldowns, shrugs, leg extensions superset with leg curls

**Squat day:**

* Split squats, weighted back extensions, lat pulldowns

Ab rollouts or hanging leg raises every day. If I had extra time I would do a facepull/tricep superset with the ropes or a curl/forearm curl superset.

Some kind of conditioning every workout and on most rest days.

My accessories often changed if I got bored or wanted to train for a specific event, but for the most part I would keep them the same so I could track progress. Sometimes I would do cleans with an axle bar or regular bar after a squat or deadlift workout. Sometimes I’d do incline bench press instead of close grip bench. Sometimes I would do leg press, hack squats, or smith machine squats instead of leg extensions or split squats on one of my lower body days.

**Conditioning:**

Usually done every day. I would often rest on the weekend and not do too much. Conditioning always changed based on the current needs. If I had nothing to prep for it was just sled pushes/pulls, jogging, sprinting, and bike.

If I was prepping for a comp it was usually comp specific. High volume lift representing the strongman event. Tire flips, vehicle pushing, sled pushing, power cleans, carrying stuff, etc…

**Other:**

Every other week or so I would skip my Wednesday rest day and take Friday off so I could train strongman events on Saturday.

**Diet:**

I usually ate quite a bit. Between 3,500 – 4,000 calories for the most part unless I was cutting weight. I often cut shortly after comps because I liked to drop 5-10 pounds and then bulk up into my next competition. Felt like I was stronger if I was gaining weight so I never went into a competition dropping body weight. It has worked pretty well. I’ve brought home some cool strongman trophies!

I just tried to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. I ate like every 3 hours because sometimes I would get caught up and not eat enough to go along with my training.

Supplements? Just some caffeine and creatine. Fish oil.  Mostly pizza.

**Findings:**

The first week of the new cycle was always a killer. Week 2 was much better and by week 3 the supplemental work felt like I was throwing it around. It wasn’t uncommon that I had to rest for the last set or two of the supplemental work on week 1. Maybe on OHP I would have to Push Press most of the last set. Deads turned into touch and go’s, etc…

Other than that I really liked it. I would almost get nervous/excited for a new cycle and I really liked knowing exactly what I was working towards for almost the entire year.

At first I was able to push the + sets early on. As the TM’s got heavier and heavier I was doing 5 pro’s more often. I think if I would have picked the lower TM this wouldn’t have been an issue and the next time I run this that’s the plan.

**Random notes:**

I love doing the supplemental work as a variation of the main work. The important thing is to use the appropriate TM for the different work. I don’t suggest basing it off of the TM of your main work.

For the most part I would pause my main bench sets, but do touch and go’s on the supplemental.

Trap bar the main deadlifts (if I was preparing for a car deadlift) and conventional deadlifting the supplemental.

Using front squats or SSB squats as the main work and doing the supplemental as back squats.

Using the log or axle every now and then on OHP, etc…

**What’s next?**

I’m going to challenge myself in the next weight class in strongman. I’m going to follow BBBeefcake, BTM, and deep water. The goal is to gain 20 pounds, then follow it up with 12 weeks of other programming while I cut 10 of those pounds back off. Repeat for another 20 pound gain and then another 10 pound cut. That will put me right around 225 body weight, a nice place to be when competing in the 231 weight class as I can go into comps gaining weight like I usually do. Maybe I get fluffy. Maybe I look buff. At the end of the day I don’t care too much as long as I get stronger.

"Hi everyone! I'm 23 and this year I've started competitive shooting in IPSC (for the US folks is like USPSA). The past year I've been focusing on loosing weight training with a personal trainer and doing mainly calisthenics, but now the cost of training for IPSC really took the budget I got and, because I'm not really a fit kind of person I was looking for something I could do at home. Do some of you train specifically for practical shooting? Do you have routines or something I can follow online, like videos or something? 
Basically a match consists (obviously) of shooting, so using a minimal grip strength, then there's a lot of sprinting, squatting while shooting in awkward positions, and sometimes ducking and moving through tunnels. So mainly is a lot of cardio work, the match are a some of stages that doesn't last more than 30/40 seconds at worst. 
The idea is to get faster and develop a good coordination in explosive movements. I don't really need to get a ton of muscles to manage recoil, contrary to what most people think, I just need to be more athletic. 
Sorry if is a dumb question but I really don't know much about, and tbh I just don't want to waste time and energy in some routine not useful or to get hurt with dumb exercises found randomly online. Any suggestions are welcomed!
P.s.: sorry for mistakes if there are, English is not my first language and thank anyone in advance!",fitness

"**Five Point Summary:**

-At a certain point fixating on and structuring your short/mid-term goals around a narrow group of lifts becomes detrimental, both mentally and in terms of progress. 

-Expanding the scope of the PRs you chase and track, in terms of new lifts, new variations, and new rep ranges, is a solution to this problem. 

-Improvements in new areas can later contribute to improvements in old areas. 

-When comparing your current lifts to lifts you've previously performed, consider the context of both sets. 

-A proposed application of these ideas into a loose training structure. 

**Introduction**: 

Yesterday I made [this comment with some disjointed ideas on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/ovbe70/controversial_training_myths/h7b4dkh/). I haven't been able to get the desire to expand, structure and otherwise clean up the ideas out of my head so here we are. This will be a short description of the need for, benefit of, and application of the ""anything can be a PR"" mindset. I will clarify here that this is not necessarily good advice for beginners. I won't say exactly where it starts to apply, because saying 'this is for intermediates and up' bases the recommendation on one of the most poorly and inconsistently defined classifications in lifting, but I feel like this kind of approach and mindset will probably push a beginner into a pattern of 'fuckarounditits' due to the fact that a beginner is probably not plateauing for the same reasons as a more experienced lifter. With that said let's jump in. 

**The Problem**: 

The problem I am hoping to address and offer a solution to is a fixation that many lifters have on a narrow selection of lifts when determining what represents a PR/goal. The most common collection of goals/relevant PRs to lifters is probably the Squat/Bench/Deadlift (SBD) 1 rep max (RM). They are ubiquitous lifts, anyone who is lifts knows about them and can probably appreciate them. Maximum single rep is also probably seen as the gold standard for 'strength' the majority of lifters, or at least the most significant minority. The most common goals I see in progress posts or comments establishing goals revolve around improving 1RM in lifts like these. I know that there are several other fairly common examples but I won't list them all here.  Now these are NOT bad goals, nor unimportant PRs. In fact they are great goals and exciting PRs as far as I am concerned. I care about, push for and track my 1RM in all of these lifts and more. The issue comes about when these are the ONLY goals you set/PRs you care about. 

Lifting offers diminishing returns, that's just the sad fact of it. Progress will always become progressively slower the better you get. Weekly increases in SBD 1RM become monthly increases, become yearly increases, become multi-year increases. A lifter will rapidly reach a point where the positive feedback of getting a new PR or meeting a goal becomes less and less frequent. This kills motivation. There is boatloads of research on the importance of regular positive feedback, small victories, and the like in the preservation of motivation and productivity. If you cut off the stream of achievement and results you slowly erode your motivation and damage your mindset. Beyond that even the most disciplined lifter who cares fuck all about motivation and will go to the gym and bust ass like some kind of forklift robot will still see reduced progress and results from continuously pounding their head against a wall when plateaued in an effort to reach a new level on the same lifts. Trying again and again with the same approach when it has not worked before is not determination, it's [insanity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itjmKlYjUak&ab_channel=PassandoStress)

**Broadening Your Horizons:**

The solution to this fixation and inevitable stagnation is change, and one way to create that change is to expand the scope of what is a PR and what goals you set. Lets look at an example of this:

-*Your initial goal/tracked PR*: Squat 1RM. 

-*The expanded list of potential goals/PRs you could* ***also*** *set and track*: Squat 10RM, Squat 20RM, Safety Squat Bar Squats, Front Squat, Buffalo bar, Giant Camber Bar, Spider Bar, Split Squat, Zercher, Paused Squat, Wide Stance, Narrow Stance, fucking LOG BACK SQUAT, for 1/5/10/15/20/25RM, for 5x5, 10x10, most in a minute, most in a single breath, best 1RM wearing a diving suit, whatever. 

The list is almost endless. You can pick ANYTING to be a goal and eventual PR. And it can be just as rewarding and valuable as your barbell back squat 1RM once you adopt the proper mindset. Chase any of the above for weeks or months, as long as you can while making consistent progress. But once you hit a plateau^1 just let it go, you do not need to keep grinding with minimal progress towards that same goal, there is a very long list of new goals to reach and new PRs to set. If you rotate enough variations of movement, rep range, bar, ect you can be making near weekly progress almost indefinitely instead of sitting on a plateau baking in the sun seeing very little return for your lifting investment. And when you eventually cycle back around to the same lifts, bars, rep ranges, ect you will have grown so much bigger and stronger in a general sense that you will be ready to see rapid progress again. 

^1 *I'm going to make a footnote here. A plateau is not a bad day, it's a prolonged period of stagnation. Please don't read this and start whipping around to different goals a programming every time you don't do strictly better than the last session. Give things *some* time and make sure your fundamentals are in order before you start calling things plateaus and jumping ship. This is very important for newer lifters as you almost certainly are 'plateauing' for reasons that are unrelated to the lift itself and will just carry over to any new goals you make. 
*
I am speaking from personal experience when I make these suggestions. I spent over a year gaining only 10lbs on my SBD 1RM total. Not per lift, that was on my entire total. After I hit my first big plateau I kept trying to beat those lifts, they were what I cared about. I trained harder, longer, and all I had to show for it was a 10lb jump to my squat and some various injuries. The programs that turned this around for me were Deep Water (Beginner and Intermediate) by Jon Anderson and Average to Savage 2.0 (A2S2) by Greg Nuckols. 

To give a brief description of each Deep Water (DW) has a progression based on 100 rep days in the big barbell compounds. Beginner uses 10x10s dropping the rest period every other week, and Intermediate takes those 100 reps and has you complete them in a progressively lower number of sets. A2S2 has you working on 10 different lifts (an upper body and a lower body lift each day in the 5-day version I use), progressing through a range of weights and rep ranges, with as many reps as possible (AMRAP) sets each day on the last set. 

I ran DW first, it came on the tail end of over a year of fruitlessly pushing a butchered version of 531 BBB. With this program the goal was not 1RM, it was 100 reps. That is massively different. The first week was awful, with 4 minutes rest between each set of 10. The next time was still awful, with 3 minutes between sets, but I completed it. And that was a PR. That was quantifiable progress that I could see and be proud of. This continued down to 2 minutes, and into intermediate where I ended up being able to complete all 100 reps in 7 sets (1 less than the last weeks required) with increased weight. That was huge progress in only 12 weeks, it was the first serious achievement I had felt since setting my last SBD 1RM over a year beforehand. In my mind I had done more in those 12 weeks than I had done in the previous ~70. 

Later on I did A2S2 and once again I got to experience regular, consistent progress in the 7 lifts that were not barbell Squat, Bench and Dead. Every week was a PR. I was developing muscles in ways I had not before because I was pushing new movements in new rep ranges. Every time I came back to a rep range I had done before, or a weight I had done before I knew what I had done the last time and was driven to beat it by *just a bit*. There were sets I would have probably called earlier but I was *so close* to that new PR that I powered through. 

This broadening of my views on what goals could be and what PRs were worth thinking about and tracking not only returned motivation and enjoyment to my workouts, but fed into progress in my initial goals. After that long plateau I have had regular progress on my SBD 1RM, adding 150lbs to my total in ~2 years after the ~1.5 years that gave only 10lbs. 

These days I am spending less and less time focusing on SBD 1RM, keeping my time and focus on new goals, which makes me bigger and stronger and enables me to get PRs when my focus comes back to S, B, or D 1RM. 

What it all boils down to is by changing your focus regularly you can maintain a steady stream of progress in the short term. This not only has the benefit of keeping your training mentally rewarding, but also forces you out of your 'comfort zone' by making you train your body in new ways, this builds your overall strength and size, and that will ultimately help with everything else.

**Thinking About Context**: 

Now the above is the idealized version of this mindset. The reality is that most people are not going to take such a flexible approach to training and goals. Most people will always have pet goals or specific movements/bars/rep ranges that they care about more. Everyone has a favorite child. And these favored lifts will probably stay in your training regularly, even if progress is slow.  I will fully admit that even I can't/won't fully jump into this philosophy. So when you refuse to give up on a lift for a while you need to keep context in mind when looking at your results in the short term. 

Imagine this scenario. You are at the tail end of program that heavily focuses on bench. The program has been tapering down and peaking you for a 1RM test in the final week. You hit a new PR on bench in that final week. You move on to a new program that's more focused on general hypertrophy, with heavier volume on arms (specifically triceps) and less dedicated bench work. Halfway through this program you have reason to try a bench 1RM and you absolutely shit the bed, losing 20lbs on what you can do for 1 rep. Did you get weaker, did you bench get worse, should you feel terrible about it? No, to all of the above, the *context* is just different. You went from an ideal scenario for bench 1RM (lots of bench focused training, a body that has been permitted to shed fatigue and peak) versus a shitty scenario for bench 1RM (not much bench practice, a more heavily fatigued body, particularly crucial muscles like the triceps). You cant expect to perform the same in both situations. 

Now imagine you keep training your bench in this program, and a similar program afterwards. Maybe 6 months later, if not more, you finally manage to tie your old 1RM PR. Did you just now finally catch up to where you were? Again, no, you got a lot stronger. You managed to get the same lift in a much less conducive environment. If you go forward, train with a dedicated focus on bench again and let your body peak you are going to smash your old PR, almost guaranteed.

Continuing on this train of thought, I want to propose that turning an old 1RM PR into a single you can hit regularly in any kind of training situation is a huge accomplishment in of itself. In fact I would say that this should be the number one goal for the lifts you can't quite drop from your training but have accepted need to move to the backburner. I do not feel like I have stagnated when a lift has not gone up, provided I have maintained it in a context that is not good for that lift. For example, just today I hit a single on bench equal to an old PR from the end of last year. This was lower than my current 1RM PR. At first my reaction was to be disappointed, but that is wrong. I am benching once a week (versus 3+ times like I was when I set the last two PRs), I beat the shit out of myself doing legs yesterday and have been training hard for hypertrophy in general for over a month now. I woke up this morning *very clearly* fatigued but I still managed to hit a rep, pretty easily, that only 8-9 months ago was  the best rep I had ever done. That is progress. 

**Eternal: A Training Framework that Embraces this Mentality**

I will start this section with a caveat that this will be a very loose idea of how a program that takes this idea to heart could look. Its not polished, its not tested, its just what I have come up with over the last day. I might come back and work with it more later but know that right now it's a *concept*.  But if it inspires you and you try something like it please let me know how it goes, I would love to hear about it. I think you could reasonably run this kind of training structure under any conditions and indefinitely (until you get bored of it or desire some more technical and focused training for specific goals anyways), hence the name. 

The Basic Structure:

-4-6 Days/wk

-2 Days PR Chasing Movements, 2 Days Anchor Movements, 0-2 Days Accessory Hypertrophy work


PR Chasing Movement Days:

Pick 2 movements (probably one upper body and one lower body movement, but you do you) that you will be focusing on to set a PR every week. These should be movements you are reasonably familiar with but have not trained hard recently. Your main set of these day will be the PR Chase set. This should start with a Rep/Weight scheme that is challenging but not maximal effort. Every week you will perform this same movement with the goal of setting a PR by either adding weight or reps. You should not try to blow your previous weeks set out of the water, add only 5-10lbs (or even less if it is a light movement) or 1-2 reps. You will stall eventually, the more solid weeks of progress you can get before that though the better. Before or after this PR set perform build up sets or back off sets, your preference. This should be 2-4 sets and should be relatively easy compared to the PR chase set. Drop weight and or reps compared to the PR chase set. I have not thought about this enough to give firm numbers so use your best judgement. If doing build up sets be sure to give enough rest before the PR chase set that you can give it a good effort. These sets are to be followed by your choice of accessory work. Ill give some rough ideas below. 

When you fail to set a PR you have the option of giving it one more week if you think there is a good reason you failed (life got in the way, minor injury, ect), or moving the movement to the Anchoring days and choosing a new PR chase movement. If you picked an upper and a lower like I suggested choose the same type of movement to replace this one. 

Anchor Movement Days: 

When starting the program you can just pick an upper and a lower (or whatever, again, you do you) movement that you have trained hard recently as you will not have any failed PR Chasing movements to use. On the anchor movement days we will focus on reinforcing the lift you just had a chain of PRs on. You will perform 3-4 sets with this movement, using a weight/reps that is just a bit easier than the PR, enough that preforming it 3-4 times with a good amount of rest is hard but doable. E.g. drop a 5RM to 3x3 or drop the weight by a bit less than 10% and perform 3x5. Again, use your best judgement on these sets and adjust accordingly to get 3-4 hard, but doable working sets. When a PR chase movement gets moved to the anchor movement day the old anchor movement gets dropped from the program. 

Again chose accessory work after these sets based on your preference. 

Accessory Hypertrophy Days:

These days are optional and you should pick a number of days according to your goals, recovery potential and time. For example, you should probably include one or both if bulking, but remove them when cutting. Likewise if you have a busy schedule you can probably ignore them, or if you know your recovery is shitty at the moment. I won't tell you exactly how to train these days but I think an upper focused day and a lower would make sense, though other splits could also be acceptable depending on your goals and how you are laying out your accessories on other days. 

Examples of Accessory splits:

-U/Lx2 on the PR/Anchor days, full body (or preferential focus) or U/L on the dedicated accessory day(s)

-PPLx2 Spread across the six days, with your two favorite/most focused days on the dedicated accessory days 

-Chest, Back, Arms, Shoulders/Legs 

-You get the idea. 

On the PR/Anchor days I would suggest keeping your accessory worked reigned in, with quality over quantity. 3 sets each of three movements with near max effort on the first two and maximal effort (potentially with intensity modifiers) on the last for example. You can treat work for small muscles or muscles that usually take high volume work (like abs, calves, side/rear delts, ect) as extras on top of this if you have time. 

For the dedicated accessory hypertrophy days feel free to indulge. 

In general I think you can take some leeway with your split choices in regards to the PR chase and Anchor movements. For example it it not the end of the work to work chest accessories the day before or after a PR chase day with a bench variant. This might be the only way to make a split fit your days working and it will not kill you to do so. 


**Conclusion**: 

I don't have much more to say. This is a mindset that I have been steadily embracing more and more and I think it has a lot to offer to many lifters who are starting to run into those longer plateaus around there focused lifts as they move past the beginner stages into more advanced territory. I wish I had had the realizations I have now had earlier, as it would have saved me some time and made some years of my training more productive. I'm sure I will read this over later today after I have let it sit out of mind for a while and make some small changes to improve how it reads but in the mean time feel free to ask for clarification or elaboration.",fitness

"I've decide to make this post because other transformation post(s) seem to be receiving very helpful information. Firstly I want to clarify that I wasn't clear and concise on lifting for 6 years straight.

&#x200B;

**Training phase:**

First two years I really tried focusing on form and dieting, but information wasn't readily available like it is today. But as of recently fitness has been exploding. I started with random weights and no goal in mind. I wasn't aware of how much volume and muscle growth was possible within a certain time frame. So literally just messed around for 1-2 years.

Third year was when I started taking things more seriously. This was where half of my current gains occurred. WATCHING informative videos, reading articles with scientific backing helped significantly. 100gram protein intake. Chicken every morning and beef at night. Also protein shakes occasionally. My training got more serious as well because things started to hurt less after my form was fixed. At this point I'm 115lb. I was mostly hitting around 3-4 sets and 6-8 reps with about 1 hour workout. Training got very difficult because I wasn't seeing much, so less motivation to work harder. But turns out it was my lack of food.

4th year was where I got into everything precisely. I went from 115lb to 130lb with the help of mass gainer and pb&j. Everyone says that mass gainer isn't helpful or its just loaded with sugar. But in the end, it helped me put on more than 10lb of muscle and serious mass ;). This was over a 1 year period. My training also got more intense. From one hour workouts to 2-3 hours. Shooting around 5-6sets, 6-15 reps, and 3 workouts per muscle group. Hitting every muscle group twice a week. The most mass and strength was gained the 4th year because everything was aligned. Dieting, training, and sleep. At one point, I trained so hard that I had erectile dysfunction and 24/7 fatigue. So i had to back off on the sets and go at a slower pace.

I have been having issues getting the right amount of calories and macros due to appetite, if diet was perfect I should weight much more. But I'm not sure, so I'd like to see what you guys have to say. I'm planning to do a natural physique in men's if I get my dieting right by next summer. But it could possibly be much longer than that.

My form is fine on most lifts. Just depth issues for squat due to hamstring/ankle mobility. I cannot go ATC due to tension loss past hip and knee alignment. Shoulders sometimes have extreme pain if I touch chest with bar on bench (yes form is perfect). My lifting forms/routine are based off of Jeff Nippard and Renaissance periodization youtube videos.

I've been trying to eat 5 times a day and protein intake has been 100grams. Caloric intake is 1500, I want to reach 8% by the end of summer. Workouts isn't as great in an attempt to cut down in bf. But it seems like I might be 120lb at 8%. At 2000-2500 I'd be gaining fat. So 1500 is the threshold for losing weight.

My current target is 160lb at 12%bf. Im assuming that at 160lb, my daily caloric intake should be 2500kcal. As i have a few friends who are at that bw with 2500kcal daily. But because of my current weight, 2500 would add a lot more fat than help with muscle gains. I've tried a increase of calories in a short time but it added lots of fat on. I got 160lb because that seems to be the near genetic muscular potential for my body composition based off this website. https://mennohenselmans.com/ffmi-calculator/",fitness

"Soooo I've recently restarted going to the gym after an extended rest period of about 4 years lol. I had to stop cause of wrist issues (wrist tendonitis + instability), even though that original period of weightlifting only lasted 3-4 months back when I was 17/18.

But it's been less than 2 months, and my joint issues are back - this time, with my shoulder, elbow and left knee joining the list of joints who protest me going to the gym. This is very aggravating, because I've been using quite low weights (upwards of 15/20 reps to reach anything even approaching close to failure) for generally 3 sets. I am also fairly certain that my form is good.

None of my joints **hurt** but they feel the strain, and I know that if I keep going, I'm just gonna make it worse.

So, much to my chagrin, I'm gonna take a 2 week break - no gym, no bodyweight exercise, trying to limit stress on joints from keyboard typing. Hopefully this'll help.

Then I'll start from scratch, on very low weight, as I did at the start of June, and work myself up again.

Which kinda raises the question which this entire point was leading up to:

If tendons + joints require such a loooong time to adjust to higher loads being placed on them, compared to muscles, which adjust quite quickly, how do you carry out progressive overload safely? In particular for beginner lifters, who's loads are going to increase enormously in a relatively short period of time.

Any advice/insight would be welcome!

EDIT: My program is :

Workout 1:

* Squat 10kgs
* Dumbbell Bench press (3 -> 4 -> 5kg in each hand)
* Lat pulldown: 18 -> 32kg
* Calf raise on machine:
* Dumbbell curl (where I supinate my wrist through the movement): 3 -> 4 -> 5kg in each hand

Workout 2:

* Deadlift: 20 Kg
* Standing dumbbell Shoulder Press ( 3 -> 4kg in each hand)
* Chest-supported T-Bar row: 18 Kg
* Leg extension: 
* Cable fly: 5.7kg in each hand
* Crunch (or another ab exercise)
* Tricep extension on cable (or another tricep exercise): 18kg

Workout 3:

* Dumbbell lunge: 7kg
* Dumbbell incline press: 3kg -> 4kg
* Reverse grip lat pulldown: 32kg
* Barbell hip thrust: 40kg
* Face Pull: 14kg
* Dumbbell lateral raise: 2kg -> 3kg

Generally I do 2 workouts a week on average. I started off at very light weight for all these movements (generally above 15 reps to even get close to failure). As I was tightening up my form and got more confident, I raised my weight, except for exercises which I viewed as risky, such as dumbbell presses, dumbbell shoulder presses (pretty much all exercises which fucked with my wrist in the past).

"**Tl;dr - For maximum success, create a hierarchy of goals and approach them with good vibes.**

[LINK TO EPISODE](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)

New! 1/3/21 - [Link to accompanying article](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/goal-setting/)

Tis the season for New Year's Resolutions (NYRs), and [the most recent Stronger by Science podcast](https://sbspod.com/episodes/goal-setting-and-behavior-change)  came through with evidence based tips on how to best set fitness goals.  And before you dismiss January 1 as insignificant or primed for failure, SBS shares that rates of success for NYRs aren't that bad.  Six months into the year 69% of people in one study were claiming success, and 55% were still claiming it after 12 months.  ^(19:50)  Additionally, the ""fresh start effect"" that the new year offers is real and able to be leveraged. ^(24:00)

So what does the science say about setting ourselves up for success with NYRs or any other goal?  Establish a hierarchy of goals that all support each other.  ^(30:50)

* Start with a **SUPERORDINATE** goal. Have a big, value- or identity-based goal as an anchor that will provide your ""why.""  It should explain why all your smaller goals matter and act as a motivating force.
* Next have **INTERMEDIATE** goals.  These will be a little less vague and give you a clear route to accomplishing your big goal while still allowing flexibility in the path you take to get there.
* Finally, have **SUBORDINATE** goals.  This is where your SMART goals live for all of you trembling in anticipation of seeing your favorite acronym.  Your subordinate goals set up what you're going to do, how you'll do it, and when it will get done.  These are the goals you interact with on a daily basis.  Because you've set your Intermediate and Superordinate goals, these can be adjusted as needed to find any of the many routes to success.

You've got your hierarchy.  What's next?  SBS reviews what the evidence says will help you meet those goals.

* Identify your specific obstacles, and set your intermediate and subordinate goals to target them.  ^(49:50)  Set an if/then plan for when you will implement behaviors that lead to your goals.  ^(1:23:53)
* Plan not only your actions but your coping when things go wrong.  Challenges will always arise, and you can think through how you'll address them ahead of time.  ^(1:29:20)
* Utilize approach goals instead of avoidant goals.  ""I will eat more vegetables"" instead ""I will not have candy.""  Approach goals are associated with positive emotions and greater well-being, and the evidence supports it's a more successful route to take.  ^(52:50)
* Pair a delayed gratification behavior with something enjoyable in the moment.  For example, listen to your favorite true crime podcast only while you're out for a walk.  This ""temptation bundling"" adds an incentive for your goal based behavior.  ^(1:25:30)
* Piggyback new habits onto ones already established.  ^(1:28:17) 
* Allow yourself flexibility both with diet ^(1:03:34) and other behaviors.  Having some ""slack with a cost"" leads to increased persistence. ^(1:18:00)

One common theme that ran through the goal setting and the achievement strategies was this - NO BAD VIBES.  Setting goals properly and with things you can control will help you succeed.  There is no need for shame or the idea that failure or setbacks are a personal failing. ^(51:30)  Good vibe approaches work.

"24 years male, 1,87m(6'1) went from 87,3kg(192,5 lbs) to 68,5kg(151lbs) in 6 months.

[Progress pic/TDEE estimate/Weight Loss Graph](https://imgur.com/a/i2K3eSO)

**Diet:**

Calories:

Setted the goal of losing 0,9% bodyweight per week, eated the calories that would cause this given the amount of exercise I was doing, check TDEE estimate to see calories and weight variation.

Macros:

Sticked to 2,2-2,8g/kg/day of protein cause of the satiety benefits instead of the 1,6-2,2 range.

For fats I stayed near 0,5g/kg/day and minimizing saturated fats, and the rest I completed with carbs and sometimes alcohol.

I weighted myself every morning right after waking up and using the bathroom, only supplements I took were creatine monohydrate and a big cup of coffe before workouts.

**Exercise:**

Routine:

I sticked with Push-Legs-Pull since I went to the gym 6 times a week. Chose my exercises based on the concept of SFR(stimulus to fatigue ratio) since those were my first 6 months in the gym the first 2 were more experimentation and seeing what worked best for me but from there I sticked with those:

PUSH:

1. CHEST PRESS
2. SHOULDER PRESS
3. INCLINE DUMBELL BENCH PRESS
4. MACHINE ASSISTED DIP
5. CABLE TRICEPS PUSHDOWN
6. HANGING LEG RAISES

LEGS:

1. LEG PRESS
2. DUMBELL STIFF LEG DEADLIFT
3. THIGH ABDUCTOR
4. SUMO SQUAT
5. LEG EXTENSION
6. CALF PRESS
7. AB CRUNCH MACHINE

PULL:

1. MACHINE ASSISTED PULL UP
2. SEATED MACHINE ROW
3. UPRIGHT ROW
4. BARBELL CURL
5. MACHINE BICEP CURL
6. TWISTING SIT UP

I did 2 Mesocycles with a deload in the middle of them (it's the green week on TDEE estimate) for sets and reps I started lightly at 2 sets each exercise and 3 Reps in reserve in first week of the meso and increased it to 5 sets each exercise and 0 Reps in reserve in the last week of the meso. At the first 3 days of the week I focused on progressing load and in the last 3 days of the week I focused progressing reps, that made me stay in the 8-12 rep range for the first 3 days and 10-20 rep range for the last 3 days.

This part was really auto regulated I didn't increase every exercise to 5 sets I just increased the volume enough to give me greats pumps, burn in high reps sets, tension in low rep sets and recovering fast enough to not be sore on the next day I trained that same muscle group and ofc started relatively light and made it unsustainably hard in the last week.

Alright, I imagine that all of the above are pretty usual things that most of folks probably do, now I also done two other things that I think helped me a lot!

First: I made use of 2 days Refeeds based on a study that saw greater muscle retention, I putted those on Thursday and Friday to get the beginning of high rep half of the week and since on Sunday I rested it made possible to increase volume while still being able to recover properly.

Second: Only cardio I did was taking steps, A LOT of steps. Steps are really inefficient from a time pov but when you factor the fatigue it generates its really small you can burn so much calories without hurting NEAT or training that is completely broken. I started by taking 10000 steps daily but ramped it up to 20000 steps near the end of the diet. You can check on TDEE that I was eating 2150kcal and still losing tons of weight in the end cause of the high volume training and high step count.

I read the following books to help me guide the methodology I used:

1. Art of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
2. Science of Lifting - Greg Nuckols
3. Fat Loss Forever - Layne Norton
4. The Pyramid of Muscle - Eric Helms
5. Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy - Brad Schoenfeld

Next on my list are the Renaissance Periodization books since Dr. Mike Israetel seems an amazing author.

Thanks for reading if you made it to here! My future plan now its to maintain and deload for the next 2 weeks and start a mass gaining phase at the rate of 0,5% bodyweight per week for 6 months while lifting heavy.",fitness
"Hello,

New to the sub. So, I apologize if this was brought up on here often. 

I exercise at a boutique fitness place that is quite intense. I usually burn around 800-1100 calories per hour class. I’ve been doing this for 4 months now and it’s starting to get me down.

I take 3 classes a week but I’m not recovering. I thought I was just I was just over doing it and decided to take a week off to recover. But when I returned I was just as fatigued as before. I have trouble getting out of bed. Walking up a flight of stairs is unbearable. 

I’m taking the correct vitamins and protein. I get 8-9 hours of sleep. I well hydrated. I even drink Pedialyte occasionally to make sure I have all my electrolytes.

Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Is this common?

Edit: I’m 280 lbs 6”4. Haven’t lost any weight since starting. But I believe I gained muscle mass",fitness

"**INTRO**

I remember the last time I ran Deep Water it effectively traumatized me.  I had a cut-off Punisher t-shirt I wore for every squat day on the program that I had to get rid of once it was all over because it was so saturated with fear sweat that it smelled like an open grave and NO amount of washing could get the smell out.  I walked like a toy soldier 6 days a week while I waited for the soreness to go away, I constantly had to field the question of “are you ok?”, my wife frequently found me on the floor in the garage with my head propped up on a furniture dolly to prevent me from drowning in my own sweat, I learned to take an excederin between sets 7 and 8 of the squat workout to chase away the inevitable exertion headache that ALWAYS happened (followed by a Rockstar right after the workout), and I remember “running out of time” on my lunch breaks, just eating as soon as the window opened and stopping when my break was over, HOPING I had put away enough food to recover from my previous workout and be able to train for the next one.  I also remember saying on multiple occasions that it was the most effective program I had run in 21 years, and that’s what I had to remind myself when I decided to take it on again.


And, of course, me being me, I couldn’t just do the same thing twice, so I’m going to start this review talking about all the stuff I did that was DIFFERENT from before, and how that worked out for me.


Without further ado…

**SIGNIFICANT DEVIANCE**


Since I’ve already run this program before, I allowed myself to play around and experiment.  BUT, along with that, my schedule forced me to deviate quite a bit as well.  Specifically, I had 2 one week interruptions within the 6 weeks of the program: one a visit to my in-laws, and one a work trip.  I STILL wanted the program to take around 6 weeks to complete, which meant I took on the task of running the program WITHOUT days off.  I’d run 5 days of week 1, then 5 days of week 2, then 5 days of week 3, etc.  I figured the 14 total days off would give me enough of a break to recover from that.  It shook out that my 1 week break occurred between week 2 and 3, and between week 5 and 6.  During those weeks off, I did a TON of conditioning work, using a weighted vest and a kettlebell while at my in-laws (to include a [100 burpee workout with an 80lb vest](https://youtu.be/fWcw1qbqKjs) and some other terrible WODs) and bodyweight and bands during my work trip (reference my recently posted “Hotel Room Conditioning Insanity” post, which included 2 different 500 burpee workouts among other variants).

On top of that, here are other ways I deviated.

•	I kept up my daily work.  Every day, I did 50 chins, 50 dips, 50 band pull aparts, 40 reverse hypers, 30 GHRs, 25 band pushdowns, 20 standing ab wheels, and 11 neck bridges in 4 different directions.  Exceptions being, if a movement was featured in a Deep Water workout, I wouldn’t do it as part of the daily work.

•	I continued doing conditioning daily, and frequently multiple times a day.  I rotated through a variety of Crossfit style WODs, to include Grace, Fran, Legion of Doom, Black and Blue, 30 thrusters for time w/135lbs, and just other nasty things with barbells, kettlebells, and burpees.  I’d include some running and weighted vest walks as well.  For the ACTUAL conditioning day of Deep Water, I’d do the Juarez Valley front squat workout.  I actually found that I recovered FASTER by forcing myself to do a lot of conditioning with an emphasis on squatting.


•	On that note, for the “technique work” on the Deep Water days, I took to including those 30 total reps into a WOD, done later in the day.  For squats, I was a fan of doing 10-5-15 of squats at 275, chins and dips, and then for deadlifts I’d do 12-9-6-3 of deadlifts, chins and dips, always trying to beat time.  It was a good way to kill 2 birds with one stone: get in the reps, practice technique, and get in conditioning.


•	I added significant work to the back day.  I did all the prescribed work, but also added a high rep set of axle shrugs against bands (starting at 75 and working up to 100 total reps), a set of kroc rows, and 50 band pull aparts.

•	  On press days, I stuck with my lateral raise dropset and Poundstone curls vs the prescribed sets and reps for lateral raises and curls.  I also tended to include band pull aparts between presses, as they made my shoulder feel better.

•	Instead of hyperextensions and sit ups, I would do a circuit of reverse hypers and standing ab wheel.

•	All presses done with an axle, taken from the floor and pressed away.

•	Benching and close grip was done with an axle: incline was done with dumbbells.

•	Lunges were done with a safety squat bar.

**NUTRITION**


I honestly stuck very close to what Jon prescribed.  Organic whenever possible, high quality nutrition sources.  Still went “Deep Mountain” in that, if I allowed myself variance, it was typically something John Meadows was ok with.  This meant a daily inclusion of some dark chocolate…and honestly that’s about it.  I tried including wild blueberries in my diet, but they were wrecking my guts, so I dropped them.  And honestly, I was eating so much food through this process I lost my appetite for “treats”.  In 2019, I was eating 4 quest bars a day, and now I was at the point where I’d eat one every 2-3 days.  I preferred tuna for a quick protein dose.  My wife and I’s favorite local pizza place has a keto crust pizza that is really top notch, but I found myself going for the bone in wings in the program.  I just wanted more food to recover and couldn’t find a reason to eat any junk.  After 12 weeks of BBB Beefcake and Building the Monolith, I think I was just getting burnt out from food and was becoming robotic about it.  That having been said, the program and all the conditioning drove my appetite to even crazier levels, and I was pretty much eating every half hour on shift at work.

**SNAPSHOT: DAY IN THE LIFE**

People seem to find this fascinating, so I’ll write it up.  I’m a shift worker, so this was a day I was coming off night shift, working from 2200-0600.

•	0630: Arrive home, eat 2 whole organic free range eggs, 1 egg white, 2.25oz of grassfed beef, grassfed butter, fat free cheese and half an avocado all on an “egglife” wrap smeared with organic no sugar added sunbutter as a breakfast burrito w/organic sour cream.  2 small Birch Bender keto pancakes with nuts n more spread and sugar free raspberry preserves.

•	0700-0815 Deep Water back workout Week 5 w/aforementioned adjustments

**RESULTS, OUTCOMES AND EXPERIENCES**

On the final day of the program, I set a front squat rep PR of 225 for 15, done first thing in the morning at 0330, with at least one more rep in the tank.  This was part of my Juarez Valley conditioning protocol, and done AFTER a week off from weights due to work travel.  In turn, this speaks to just how “on” this program got me, because I hit a 500 burpee workout on the day I traveled back from work to home and then got up at 0530 the next day and crushed the week 6 10x10 deadlift workout with 2:00 rests.  Lotta folks talk about feeling weaker after a deload/week off, but every time I go to the well I keep finding more and more.


I wrote about this in the nutrition section, but to repeat: I have been eating so much that I’m just plain sick of it.  The first time I ran the program, I was obeying the idea of “eat a lot of meat and fat”, but wasn’t abiding by “organic”, and I was eating a LOT of saturated (and trans) fats.  This time around, I slashed saturated and got them from quality sources and focused more on monos.  It’s meant eating so much all the time that there’s no room for junk.  In fact, one night, my wife asked me what I wanted for dinner and my answer was legitimately “Nothing”.  THAT was my “cheat meal”.  The first time I ran the program, I’d have a cheat meal each week the night before the lower body workouts, and typically it was Panda Express with a LOT of rice and orange chicken.  This time, I had zero craving for junk, and my “cheat meal” was typically chicken wings and 3 or 4 of my wife’s curly fries at the local restaurant we like.  [I also had a 2lb tomahawk ribeye](https://i.imgur.com/BvwE57w.jpg) to celebrate a few things all at once coming back from my work trip, which I ate off the bone caveman style and found myself STILL looking for more meat when I was done.



And despite all this eating, I put on no appreciable amount of bodyfat.  Again: still not weighing myself, but I have the after photos AND my powerlifting belt, which has STILL not moved a notch from when I started at 177lbs back in Oct.  I’ve had days where I was bloated and it felt snug, and days where it’s fit just right, but I’ve NEVER had a day where it simply wouldn’t latch, whereas typically I’m operating at LEAST one notch out from this point when I’m really chasing bodyweight and eating big.

* [After](https://i.imgur.com/uu7JvtW.jpg)

Once again: aggression and libido took an uptick while on the program.  Finding myself drawn to combat sports yet again, and though options are limited, just the fact I wanna fight again is a sign of all that.


Coming into the program with a solid conditioning base was huge.  I completely blew away my old squatting numbers on the program and never once had to lay down on the floor like I did the first time.  My breathing was able to get back to normal much quicker than before, as was my heart rate.  I’ll keep beating this drum: conditioning matters.  


I did notice my times on the Grace WOD got worse through the program, but I attribute that to how much more fatigue I was carrying compared to the 5/3/1 programs, which checks out.  Jim writes programs for athletes, with the understanding that the weights are just a part of what you’re doing, so it manages fatigue and has room to play as far as conditioning goes.  Deep Water is supposed to be all inclusive, so taking onto it like I did is gonna come with some consequences. 


**IMPRESSIONS ON HOW EVERYTHING HAS FIT TOGETHER**


When I originally came up with the 26 week protocol of BBB Beefcake-Building the Monolith-Deep Water, it was honestly a bit of a “so there!”: just something to throw out and shut someone up if they didn’t know how to eat and train.  But going through it, I’m really pretty pleased with how it all fits together.  BBB Beefcake lays down a GREAT foundation to kick-start the whole time off.  You get to practice a lot of reps and develop some solid conditioning with the time constraints, and you have plenty of opportunities to get in more conditioning.  Meanwhile, the weight is on the lighter side, so you aren’t thrashing your connective tissues or digging too deep into your CNS recovery well (yeah yeah, CNS boogieman: you know what I mean).


BtM comes along and it’s SUPPOSED to be “5/3/1 for Size”, and though it DOES do that, it’s really like an intensification block from BBB Beefcake.  You’re lifting heavier weights for fewer reps and getting in most of your hypertrophy work in the assistance stuff.  The 5s pro in BBB Beefcake meant only hitting heavy work for 1 REAL set, but BtM has you hitting 3-5 sets across: it’s INTENSE.  Meanwhile, widowmakers are building up some high rep squatting ability, and the conditioning element to it is teaching you how to recover from intense work.


Deep Water comes along and kicks you straight in the junk, BUT, all that work from 5/3/1 has you ready for it.  When I first ran Deep Water, I wasn’t really doing anything intense beforehand, coming off of strongman comp preparation vs real accumulation work, and it broke me down HARD.  But coming off BBB Beefcake I was already doing HALF the program on the regular (5x10 vs 10x10), while BtM gave me a bit of a break from that to focus on getting stronger but not so much that I lost my touch for high rep sets, and throughout all that time I had been driving my conditioning so far into the red that I was totally prepared.  I also had a fairly good idea what weight was challenging for me for a set of 10 from BBB Beefcake, so there wasn’t any real need for 1rm testing and minimal guesswork.  This went from just a wild guess to something VERY viable, and may become a regular-ish thing.


**NEXT?**


Deep Water intermediate, with more deviance. Since I still don’t really have a solid grasp of my 1rm, nor any intention to test it, I’m going to pick challenging weights to concur, and then smash myself with conditioning until something breaks. After that, I’m going to take a break from eating so much goddamn food. I’m contemplating some DoggCrapp style training, as I think single hard set work will be an excellent contrast to this super high volume stuff, and the variety of movements will be good to balance so much time spent doing the same thing.",fitness
"Some of the biggest names in fitness make it sound like face pulls and band pull aparts are absolutely necessary. ""Non-negotiable"" as Jeff Cavalier puts it. My question is why? The benefits of these exercises are clear. They promote muscular balance, shoulder health, and good posture by targeting the rear delts, rhomboids, and rotator cuff. Rows and reverse flyes also directly target these muscles though, so what is it that makes these exercises uniquely beneficial. I realize external rotation isn't possible with most row variations which is an important part of targeting the rotator cuff, but this is easily done with reverse flyes by using a supinated grip. What am I missing?",fitness

"*DISCLAIMER* I apologize in advance for my run-on sentences lmao.

Alright so before posting this I know there are going to be people that absolutely despise Mike Mentzer and his style of training, and people that completely support him and his ideas, but if possible I would appreciate if any responses to this could be kept objective for the simple fact that I am only here asking about the facts, and nothing more.

Anyways, I'm still currently in the process of reading and taking notes on his last published book ""High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way,"" and knowing that in the past about 20 years a lot more scientific research has been done, more experiments and such have been conducted, which naturally would potentially mean that some of his theories since have been indirectly or directly proven. I think that the idea of High-Intensity training is very productive in a time sense, and as it has a direct correlation with training with volume (that numerous studies have been conducted on since the book's publishing,) there has to be some kind of truth to taking weightlifting protocols of each side of the spectrum to get a specific desired end result. It makes sense that this type of training style has some if not a whole lot of legitimacy to how one could go about beginning to take one's physique to the next level, however due to his untimely passing, I nor anyone else could go to him to has him more specific questions on the how's and why's of certain principles he has in his HIT workout style. Again I do not want bias or opinion, but just facts/answers that anyone might have, or how I might find them.

So these are not coming from a place of doubt, rather genuine intent to understand why things are some of the ways he claims. Note: As I continue reading, I may continue to edit this and ask more questions that I myself cannot find the answers to.

* He frequently mentions the body's ""precious energy reserves,"" and that if too much time has been spent in the gym, the reserves would be depleted further and further as lack of proper recovery to the muscular stimulus due to over training, and/or too much time in the gym. My question is that what is that measure of ""energy reserve""? This theory makes sense on paper, however how would one 100% know the as he mentions ""precise"" threshold amount of time to which one needs to be in the gym for optimal muscle growth, and/or how would one know if that threshold has been surpassed to the point where muscular regression begins to occur? Additionally, if it begins to regress and the body will as a result need more time to recover, how would or could the amount of recovery time needed be found?
* What measurements have been taken or what studies have been done to show the not only optimal ""muscle recovery"" time, but the body's energy use recovery time from weight lifting sessions? For High-Intensity? For longer Volume workouts? 
* What effects in short term and long term would this high of intensity workouts have on the body's CNS (central nervous system)? Would adequate recovery time as he describes allow for it to completely recover as well, or would it undeniably cause it burnout?
* How much of HIS actual workouts that he himself did to attain the results he got naturally (assuming he was natural, and if you claim he is not, where can it be shown concretely that he isn't) go by the guidelines written in that book? Did he actually use that much time to recover, or were a bulk of his workouts done with slightly more volume and a bit less intensity, so that he could train a bit more than max 1-2 times a week?
* This goes hand in hand with the question above, but some have speculated that his findings and claims in that book were not representative of the actual volume of work he did to get his results, and that for a majority of the time he trained he actually worked out 3-4x a week. Hypothetically, if you were to take the workouts prescribed in the book with the same time and intensity, would it be effective to do those workouts 3-4x a week? Or are they actually so intense that you should only do one every 4-7 days like he says, because his training prior to these findings weren't quite as intense, which allowed him to workout more than once every 4-7 days?
* Would using progressive overload AND linear intensity increase in workouts and decrease in times be effective or be able to be carried out in a sort of cycle with similar or good results? 

Thank you to anyone with any kind of good or useful responses. I know it is a lot of questions I am asking, but as someone who likes to find the objective truth when it comes to implementing practices in my day to day life (especially ones I will be using that have a direct impact on my body,) I know that figuring these things out will help me be able to best piece together most effective tactics from various sources, thus allowing me to have a more effective approach to how I will be lifting, and eventually will help me be able to explore and understand even more than some that have gotten this far. I find the whole science behind bodybuilding extremely fascinating, with all the different combinations of workouts and adjustable stimuli able to be manipulated in order to achieve a specific desired effect. I know lots and LOTS of others are just as interested in this if not more than me, but if I could at all contribute to helping others and myself learn more than has already been learned, it'd be super dope. If you read this much of my spiel, hats off to you ahahahah.",fitness

"**Preface**: 

This post is going to present a series of ideas on how to approach ‘form’ as a concept in lifting and it’s application. These ideas represent the thoughts and opinions on the subject that I have built over almost a decade of lifting [heavy things](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWN6v-0gSv-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with [form](https://youtu.be/8E-iMybhQUo) that has been called [questionable](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CWvYzWQgGzL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), going so far as to even win a [World Championship]( https://www.instagram.com/reel/CW_MAuRJ0YT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) in lifting unusually and in an excessive manner. That said almost everything I am going to talk about here is theoretical/conceptual, and it is what *I* think. I am not presenting facts, nor am I suggesting that anything here should become a fact. The goal is to present a viewpoint that is outside of the common understanding of form, with the hopes that you, the reader, will refine your own views on the topic. If you are convinced and agree with everything I say great, if you agree with some and move your views to something in between cool, if you think about what I am saying here and reject all of it that is okay too. The only thing I want here is to make you think more deeply about something that most people just write off as a simple and obvious topic. 

 I know that many people feel strongly about the importance of form when lifting, so I ask you to please read what I am writing and give the ideas presented a fair shake before running to the comment section to tell me how wrong I am. I intend to write this in a manner that it can be understood and processed by anyone, I will not be including complex anatomical jargon or links to dense studies that most people are not equipped to work with, and I will do my best to explain every term I am using and explain any relevant background information. That said if I am unclear in anything please feel free to ask for clarification. 

Like I did in my last post, I am going to give a short breakdown of what I will be writing about then I will get into it. 

**What Form is, and how it differs from Technique**: The first section will define ‘Form’, its counterpart ‘Technique’, and explain the differences. This is an important distinction to make both in terms of the rest of the post, and in thinking about ‘Form’ in general. 

**Why there is no such thing as ‘Perfect Form’**: The second section will look at why there is no such thing as a universal form/technique, and why individual variables, training purpose, and other factors can all influence the form/technique used. 

**Form and Injury**: The third section will cover the relationship between form and injury risk, and present an argument for thinking about injury risk as a function of load, not form. 

**Practical DOs and DON’Ts**: The final section will tie the previous ideas together into some applicable DO’s and DON’Ts.

With that out of the way lets get into the meat of the post.
___________________________________________________________________________
**What is Form, and what is Technique?**: 

The very first thing we need to do to discuss form is define what it is and is not. Form, by formal, general definition, is ‘the *visible* shape or configuration of something’. This definition applies to form in the context of lifting as well. Form is the *visible appearance of a lift, as seen by an outside observer*. This seems obvious, but this definition is important when separating form from technique. 

Technique, conversely, encompasses everything you do, consciously or unconsciously, when executing a lift. Every action you take, whether you think about it or not, to move a weight from point A to point B is part of technique. Technique is what you should be pushing to refine and improve on. Improved technique is ultimate goal, not improved *form*. 

So how does technique differ from form? The distinction sits in the ‘visible’ part of the definition. **Form is the external, visual, manifestation of technique.** Now I am well aware that this *sounds* like a pedantic distinction without merit but I think that it is very important. You cannot see every part of technique. You cannot actually see the interplay between muscle groups or the activation of each individual fiber, you cannot see the thought processes that go into activating the these muscles, you cannot see resulting forces on the weight and every bone, muscle, and joint in the body. What you *can* see is the results of those things in the way they move the body and the weight, and that is ‘form’. With form you can only *approximate* what is going on in terms of technique. 

Form is one of the few tools available to look at someone’s technique as an outside observer, but it’s limitation’s must be understood and respected. You must understand that when reviewing form you are observing a portion of the *results* from a set of actions, and then you are extrapolating what actions must have occurred to create those results. Form can never give a perfect insight into someone’s technique. With enough viewpoints and the right experience to interpret them you can get a pretty solid understanding of the technique involved but it’s still ultimately an indirect assay and thus imperfect. 

It is even more difficult to work with form in most practical settings. Unless the lifter is wearing extremely tight clothing, or no clothing at all, visual information is going to be obscured by clothing hanging in the way. Unless you are walking in circles around the lifter, viewing multiple sets from every angle you are not getting a full 360-degree view of the lift. Online it is even worse, you are getting a single (usually questionable) angle with which to view the lift in the form of a video. Not only is there an inherent disconnect between visual form and physical technique, but you are often working with an incomplete visual. This makes the final approximation even worse. 

Before moving on I want to look at a practical example to really hammer the point in: 

Picture someone deadlifting, who has some back rounding under their loose gym shirt. You can see the ‘form’ (a back that is rounded to some degree) but what can you say about the technique? Are they a beginner who is struggling to maintain a braced position and is being bent over by the weight? Or are they more experienced, purposefully maintaining that torso position while fully braced in order to effectively start from a higher position? One form, two potential technical causes. One is ineffective and should probably be corrected if the lifter wants to move more weight, the other is fine. You can use other clues to help inform that decision: how much is the lifter pulling? Do they have a level of musculature that suggests they are experienced? Is the back static or actively rounding? With this context you can make a solid assumption about technique, but the form of ‘rounded back’ does not inherently tell you what their technique is, nor if it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 

__________________________________________________________________________
**The Problem with ‘Perfect Form’**:

I am going to start by outright saying that perfect form does not exist. It cannot be achieved, it should not be a goal, and you should never try to impose it on yourself or another lifter. There are multiple reasons why this is true, and I will break them down in this section. 

***Form is not a goal***: The first point ties into the something I mentioned in the last section, and that is that *technique* should be where your focus lies, not the resulting form. With some exceptions for when form dictates what a lift is, or it’s competitive standards, the way your lift looks does not matter in the slightest. Yes, a competition squat in powerlifting needs to include your hip crease dipping below your knee line, but how the rest of the lift looks Does Not Matter. Effective technique does generally result in a certain spectrum of visual forms but outliers exist and putting the effort into making a lift look a certain way is getting the technique-form relationship backwards. **You should be trying form changes to see if they improves your technique, not changing your technique to see if it makes your form look better. **. Form is one tool for communicating and implementing technical changes, but that is it, it is not something that you should change your technique for because it has inherent value. If form is not something that you are trying to directly achieve there can be no reason to try and ‘perfect’ it. One could argue that *technique* could be perfected, but I would disagree there too. 

***We are not made equal***: Human anatomy has a high degree of variance. We are not built equally so it stands to reason that we should not lift equally either. Telling a 6’5’’ lifter with long limbs to perform a squat in the exact same manner as a 5’2’’ lifter with very short limbs is ridiculous. Limb to torso proportions, femur to total leg proportion, muscle insertions and origins (where a muscle is attached to bone), joint angles, and uncountable other variables all impact the specifics of a lifters most effective squat technique. In addition to the anatomy one is born with past injuries, personal preference, equipment choice, and other non-anatomical variables will further impact the specifics of a lifter’s technique. No two people should be lifting the exact same way, so there cannot be a universal ‘perfect’ technique.  

***How you should perform a lift depends on your goals***: Because we are all different, there is no universally perfect technique for a given movement, but *even an individual does not have a singular, personal, perfect technique*. A lifter can use the same general movement pattern for multiple purposes, and what those purposes are is going to impact the technique used. A bench press performed to move the most weight possible is not going to be performed in the same way as a bench press performed focused on building up the chest, or a bench press performed to develop a certain aspect of the technical execution. Which of these is the ‘right’ technique, which is ‘perfect’? None of them are. I guess you could go further and say that each goal for each individual has its own ‘perfect technique’ but at a certain point you are really going past the concept of ‘perfect’ by providing a rationale to call anything perfect.

*We are not machines*: We are incapable of executing a lift in the exact same manner over and over again. Even if there was a ‘perfect’ we could not reliably achieve it. It would be a fruitless endeavor to chase it. Instead we should look at what is a good, or even acceptable, *range* for our lifts. Deviation from the ideal is fine, technique that is just shy of the best still works just fine. Taking this approach not only gives a much more reasonable standard for your reps, but acknowledges that you are imperfect, that you will be fatigued sometimes, that your mind will wander a bit on some sets, and that you will phone it in sometimes. All of that is completely fine provided you stay within the acceptable range for technical execution, and program with that range in mind. Perfect is the enemy of good enough, so choose good enough. Time spent working hard with technique that is good enough will build more strength, size and experience than spending that same time trying to calculate or reach your notion of perfection.
_________________________________________________________________________________
**Form and Injury**: 

I’m going to start this section with another bold statement: no technique, or form, is inherently more dangerous or more liable to injure you than any other. I know this flies in the face of a lot of common opinion on the topic I request that you stick with me for a second. Injury in lifting can, outside of freak accidents or other odd cases, generally be attributed to improper load management, not improper ‘form’.

 Load refers to how much you are lifting, for any given rep or over time. Load management is the process of choosing appropriate weights for your sets, both long and short term. Any movement, with any technique, has a threshold for how much you can effectively lift with it, and exceeding that threshold results in an increased risk of injury. This failure to manage load can be acute, loading up more than you can effectively move for a single rep, or chronic, performing too many reps at a given load over a period of time without allowing time for sufficient recovery. These two are not completely independent, you can be pushing your long term load management a bit too far and open yourself up to an acute event that would not have been as issue if you had been more rested for example. The threshold is also not static, as mentioned above you have a ‘range’ of technique and you have a corresponding range of load thresholds, depending on how on the ball you are for any given rep/set. 

Now how does this tie into technique and form? Technique, and the resulting form, that is generally considered to be ‘dangerous’ is just less effective, and thus has a lower load threshold. Lets go back to the example of a deadlift with back rounding, in this case born of an inability to properly brace the torso and not a conscious decision to get better positioning. This is something that is generally considered dangerous, with the implication that lifting like this will injure you. That’s false. It’s not an inherently dangerous movement pattern, its just ineffective and you cannot lift very much with it before you cross the load management threshold to increase injury risk. If you don’t believe that lets do a quick mental exercise. Could you safely deadlift a pool noodle with an unbraced back? How about a 1 inch steel pipe? An unloaded barbell? 135lbs? You had to have answered yes to at least the pool noodle question, and probably some of the others. You already accept that you can safely pick up a trivial weight with this ‘dangerous’ form, so you accept that the variable responsible for injury is the weight used, not the technique. Obviously you should try to use the more effective technique, so you can safely lift more weight, but you are not going to have an excessive risk of hurting yourself using *any* technique, provided you lift within your ability for that movement. 

Now why does this matter? Isn’t it just pedantry? No. Understanding the actual cause of injury in this situation teaches several important lessons that can and should impact your training decisions:

**You need to manage your load**: Even with the best technique you can muster you are still at risk of injury if you lift too much. Good technique and form will not protect you against injury if you are pushing excessive loads and volume. This is usually obvious from the acute standpoint, it is pretty intuitive that trying to lift a lot more than you are capable of is going to chance an injury. The problem of chronic load management is less obvious. You can lift sub-maximally, with solid technique, and still open yourself to injury if you are trying to hit too many hard sets a session/week/month/other time period. Your body gets fatigued with every rep and that lowers its performance. You can’t hit your 1RM over and over again, and you probably can’t go balls to the wall on your sets in some movement 3x a week for months on end. Good programs will manage this but a lot of lifters, even experienced individuals, will push themselves too hard. It’s very tempting to keep up momentum when you are setting back to back PRs for example, but that is not a sustainable trajectory, even with your best ‘form’.

**You are probably not going injure yourself just because your technique is lacking**: The second important thing to realize from this injury model is that *any* movement can be performed with reasonable expectation of safety if you manage your load properly. I see a lot of beginners that are paralyzed by a fear of progression with sub-optimal ‘form’. They believe that they will sustain a severe injury out of nowhere at some point if they do not correct how they lift. While freak incidents can occur, this is not a reasonable fear. Even if your technique is sub-par, if you gradually add weight in a responsible manner you can keep progressing even terrible and inefficient form safely. I believe that this is a good thing in most scenarios. You are going to be more likely to adapt your technique and discover more efficient movement patterns if you are pushing yourself. Your body does not ‘want’ to move the weight in an inefficient manner, if you keep making it lift weights it will slowly find a better way to do it. You will change some little thing on each set and eventually something will click and you will find the weight moving better. If you refuse to keep slowly progressing weight out of fear of your imperfect technique you will not experience this stimulus to adapt. 


**Most serious injuries do not come without warning signs**: Of the two kinds of load management error, chronic and acute, chronic is going to be much more prevalent if you are lifting even remotely responsibly. When you have a chronic load management issue you are not going to be feeling great then suddenly develop an injury. It is a gradual process that almost always comes with some warning signs. If you are lifting too much with your bent back deadlifts, to go back to the last example, you are unlikely to suddenly develop a major lower back injury, you will experience discomfort, additional strain while lifting, or some other precursor before the injury occurs. You can use these warning signs to take proper steps to manage the issue. Accepting that you have these warning signs should open up what you are willing to try. If you are unsure about a technical change, or if something needs to be changed, you can keep working with it if nothing feels off. 

That said, you cannot always see a large injury coming, there is some inherent risk in pushing yourself with any technique. You can’t always see mild or moderate injuries/pain coming, as they can be the warning sign that something bigger might be on the way. You also may not be able to directly assess what is causing your pain in every scenario, sometimes the cause is unclear or unintuitive. You should not be paralyzed by the fear or injury or let it hold you back, but be cognizant it can happen, and that it probably will if you push yourself hard for long enough. You need to strike a middle ground between excessive fear of injury and complete disregard. Despite this, lifting is still one of the safest form of physical exercise in terms of incidence of injury/time spent, so keep that in mind. 

**You can train anything**: Outside of accusations that certain ‘form’ is dangerous on common movement I see a lot of people fully writing off all kinds of movement patterns as inherently dangerous, such as behind the neck presses or pulls. They are not. You can train *anything* with a reasonable expectation of safety provided you start at an appropriate weight and build your way up at an acceptable rate. You might discover at a low weight that a movement does not agree with you, or you might not hit a wall and find that you can build up to heavy weights in these atypical movements. Either way it’s *safe* to explore these movements if you do it properly, because *the technique and form are not inherently dangerous*. Just remember that you have little idea of your threshold with a new movement or technique, so start with conservative loads. 

**If it works, it works**: The final point I want to make is particularly aimed at newer lifters that are watching advanced lifters with unusual execution. I see a lot of people with no appreciable experience telling people lifting very serious weights that they are doing it wrong and are going to injure themselves. This is extremely misguided, and arrogant in my opinion. If someone has cultivated their personal technique to the point where they can lift such an impressive amount of weight do you not think that they have worked out a technique that is compatible with their body? Do you think they accidently managed to lift a weight that less than 1% of lifters could manage by doing everything incorrectly? No, if it works for them it works for them. Their load threshold with that odd technique is high enough to manage the weight, and probably higher than their threshold for a more conventional technique. It probably won’t work well for most people, but it works fine for them. They are not going to hurt *themselves* just because you would hurt *yourself* using a comparable technique. You are different people, with different bodies. To expand this idea, if you find yourself effectively and comfortably moving weight with a technique that is unusual, and ineffective for most other people, don’t try to change it just because it is not normal. It’s working for you, keep exploring it until it does not work for you then change whatever is not working at that point. Don’t try to fix something that is already working.  
____________________________________________________________________________
**Putting it all Together, Do’s and Don’ts**: 

This last section is going to bring all the ideas covered in the previous sections into some actionable Do’s and Don’ts when it comes to using ‘form’ to influence your training decisions and the advice you give to others. 

***DO use form as a source of potential changes for your technique***: I want to start this section by stating that form *does* have a place in making technical changes to your lift. It is very hard, if not impossible, to describe how you should change your lifting technique without framing it as form change. ‘Bring your stance closer’, ‘Try to start with your hips higher’, ‘Break at the hips before the knees’, ‘Touch lower on your chest’ are all examples of form advice that can produce beneficial change in a lifters technique. The SUPER IMPORTANT CAVEAT to this advice is that it is not absolute, everyone is going to lift a little, or a lot, differently. 
Not all lifters will use the most common stances for their lifts, not all lifters should be touching a bench press down at the same spot. It is definetely worth it for newer lifters and those experiencing a plateau in progress to explore this kind of advice, provided it’s coming from an experienced source. But if it does not improve your lift after you have given yourself time to adapt to it you should ditch it. There are no universal truths when it comes to form, and advice is only good and ‘correct’ if it is helpful. 

***DON’T cram yourself into a box and chase an idealized ‘form’***: I’ve said it already, but I really want to stress that form is a *means to an end*, not a goal in of itself. The point of trying to produce a specific form is to cultivate better *technique*. Chasing a specific form, and changing your technique to reach that, is backwards and counterproductive. If a change makes a lift look nicer, but you lift less effectively, or with more discomfort, then it is a bad change. If you find yourself comfortably (or at least a comfortably as heavy lifting gets) lifting more weight with a technique that produces an unusual form then go with it. Looking pretty while lifting is not the goal, at least it is not the goal of strong people. 

***DO frame your form advice as a suggestion, and know when not to give it***: Form policing is a cancer in the lifting community, it really is. It just keeps spreading and it strangles out the healthy, strong viewpoints on technique. You cannot know everything about a person’s lift just from watching a video of it, or from watching it in person for that matter. For that reason you really should structure your advice as *suggestions*, not absolute rules. The goal is to get the trainee to try something differently in the hopes that they discover a technical change that helps them. It’s a tool for guidance. When you tell a new lifter that they MUST lift in a specific way you stifle that discovery and inhibit their ability to find the technique that works best for them. 
Form policing also presents as people giving unsolicited and ineffective advice to experienced lifters. Everyone has room to improve, and almost every experienced lifter realizes this and strives for it. But someone watching a video of their lift and parroting generic beginner form advice is not helping them. It’s not helping anyone. It’s arrogant and condescending.
I have tried to write this entire post in a non-combative and tone, I really do want people that might not be initially accepting of these ideas to at least give them a chance and have tried to avoid putting people on the defensive for that reason. But we are nearing the end and I need to indulge a little bit on this one point and say that if you are form policing you need to shut the fuck up. 

***DON’T cling to form standards past the beginners stage***: This is a bit of an expansion on the point about chasing idealized form above. The general form advice that is given to beginners absolutely has a place. A beginner has no technique on which to build and the only way to really create that initial technique is to present a general form that they should try to imitate. This helps them stumble through their first reps and sets in a relatively safe and moderately effective manner. But these generic beginner form guidelines are *training wheels*. They are an excellent tool for initial teaching but at some point you need to remove them and learn to ride the bike. No one has ever won a Tour De France with training wheels. Don’t cling to them too hard once you have that initial technique down and certainly don’t force them onto more experienced others.

"Hi All,

I have searched google high and low for an answer to this question so I hope you lovely people can help. I have recently gotten back into exercising and specifically weight lifting and want to finally fix a problem that has plagued me all my life. Basically i was born with most of my right hand missing, google crab hand on google images and the literal first image is basically my right hand. 

The crux of the issue is that my hand ended up smaller than my wrist (I go into more detail below). But in essence any time I pull anything of weight the adaptive aid I use now goes  flying. 

&#x200B;

This has meant I have had very limited gripping strength and no palm to speak of which makes gripping exercises incredibly hard e.g. anything with a lat machine. I have an aid from the company Active Hands which works decently for any pushing exercises (although due to the small wrist size i cant do barbells without causing a decent amount of pain. This is due to all the weight on a tiny wrist area) ,however as my wrist is larger than my hand and gets sweaty mid workout, anytime I attach weight to the aid and pull it invariably ends up flying away from my hand, sometime with hilarious consequences (literally went flying across the gym yesterday when I again attempted the lat machine).

As such any advice, recommendations for alternative products or alternative back exercises you all could recommend to get over obstacle I would very very much appreciate.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Deformed hand smaller than wrist, can't grip naturally and aid goes flying off hand when I pull. Need alternate option for doing any pulling e.g. back, tricep, etc... exercises.

"Hi everyone,  


It has been a couple of months that have been on a successful bodyweight training program (unfortunately it is impractical for me to go at the gym atm). However, as I wanted to experience different ways of training, I tried working out to failure on a couple of exercises and I noticed some weird pattern.

Just to give some numbers: on push-ups specifically, I tried to go for technical failure and I reached 31 push ups in a row before my arms would push me mid-way and would not be able to produce enough force anymore. I did the same thing on Squats & lunges with a 24kg (52 lbs) kettle bell and reached 26 for squats and 33 for lunges.

Here are the things I have noticed, and I wonder if ppl experienced the same:

1. When training to failure even taking 3-5 mn rest I would never be able to reproduce the same performance on the next set. I typically aim at 3 identical sets on each exercise, and when training to failure my performance would just massively degrade no matter what (I can easily lose 5-10 reps ). Most things I have read on the topic seem to assume that you chose a number of rep to failure and them you perform the 3 identical sets, but I find it absolutely impossible.
2. I really find the fatigue of working to failure to be out of proportion with the volume. For example I can perform 10 sets of 10 push ups with 1-1:30 mn of rest between sets for a total of 100 push ups and do that every other day with no problem. However doing even 3 sets of 25 push ups seem to greatly compromise my next performance and I often need more than one day of rest to recover.
3. Now, the funny thing is that, this pattern seems mostly to apply when I train for muscular endurance, by which in mean sets of 12+ reps. When it comes to pull-ups and dips where my sets are still under the 10 reps, I can train to failure without suffering from disproportionate fatigue. I was objectively getting stronger and being able to add a few reps/weight from week to week.

Have you noticed a similar pattern where training to failure for your muscular endurance seems to fatigue you disproportionately compared to training to failure for pure strength (heavier weight and low reps sets) ? I have read some scientific literature suggesting that training to failure was not necessarily the best (especially if you want some volume for hypertrophy), but I cannot remember seeing this muscular endurance/strength divide when it comes to the fatigue failure produces.",fitness
"I'm done bulking for now and want to add a lot of back, shoulder and trap accessories to my workout. I currently do a MWF workout that is 90 percent compounds with an accessory or two thrown on the end. I don't do much cardio (but I used to do a lot).   


What I'd like to do is add those accessories but not extra days. Will it be at least somewhat effective if I do one week of compounds like I do now, and alternate with a week of accessories? Something like Compounds: MWF Cardio: T, THU SAT; Accessories: MWF, Cardio T, THU, SAT; Repeat.

This is basically my current workout. I am going to drop the extra calories. It helped me put on like 20 pounds but the extra weight makes it harder to run, etc.  [https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/ex-hardgainer-workout-eating-plan.html](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/ex-hardgainer-workout-eating-plan.html)",fitness
"So running on a treadmill for 30 min really makes me exhausted and raises my heart rate and according to the calorie counter, I have burned around 350 calories or something during that time, but it really takes a lot of effort.

If I spend the same amount  of time on an elliptical or on a bike, I will be a lot less tired after 30 min but according to the calorie counter, I would have burned much more calories

I know that you really cant rely on the calories burned counter on cardio equipment like treadmills, ellipticals, rowing machines etc BUT those numbers must be calculated based on something. And its the same with different brands of equipment in other gyms. The exact amount of calories burned will differ a little, but ellipticals and bikes will still burn more calories but with much less effort.

This has really made me curious. Are these numbers completely wrong, or do some forms of cardio burn more calories than other forms even though performing it hardly makes you tired?",fitness
"Hey all!

I have some very limited experience in lifting; I have followed programs sporadically and worked with a trainer for a month here and there but I would say I'm effectively still a beginner.

The program I've just started is based on %ages of ORM. The trainer I was working with previously actually recommended it.

My question is when and how I should calculate ORM. I have a squat cage at home as well as an Olympic bar and dumbbells, but I don't have anyone to lift with and am kind of nervous to try maxing out myself. I also feel like until I have someone there for safety I won't go to max. I need to get ORM for most of the major Barbell/Dumbbell exercises. I'm also not sure if the dumbbells I have will go high enough for me to max out (30 per hand max).

My questions are:

1. Do I do it on a normal workout day? Should I do it on a rest day and count that as my accessory/cardio work?
2. Is there a safe way to do it alone with safety bars, etc? Or should I just schedule a time with a friend who can spot. Would it be better to get into an actual gym for this process?
3. How often should I try to update this/repeat the process? I'm sure over time its going to change.
4. How should I handle ORM for exercises that don't use weights (band, bodyweight like dips, etc)?
5. What are the other ways people determine workload? Seems like there are a lot of different ideas/programs out there. I think its not so tough to determine which exercises to do but how do you know when you've worked enough or too much?

In any case, I am going to be sticking with this program to completion before I start looking into 5.

"**Intro:**

A lot of the posts on this subreddit are about the most efficient/effective way to reach your goals and if you have the time/energy/dedication to do that I have the utmost respect for you. This post, however, is not like that. I have just reached my personal goal of achieving a 4 plate (180 kg) deadlift, 3 plate (140 kg) squat, 2 plate (100 kg) bench press and 1 plate (60 kg) strict shoulder press, all in all this has taken me eight years (two years of messing around + six years of more dedicated lifting), hence why the title of this post is ‘the scenic route’ and I am here to tell you that story.

**Background:**
I am British (hence the use of kgs, sorry ‘mericans) and in highschool I was the classic lanky emo kid, in terms of sporting background I did dance and swimming up until the age of around 14/15 and then didn’t really do anything sporty until starting to go to the gym at around 17 years old. From around age 17 to age 19 my going to the gym was very sporadic and intentionless so I have not included it in detail here. I  properly got into fitness at around age 19. I am currently in the final year of grad school at a top UK uni (think Oxbridge) and studying a subject which is an experimental science, as such I have not been able maintain much consistency in my lifting (I’ll go into more detail below).

**Before and After:**

As I will also explain below, I am not really involved in fitness for aesthetic reasons but I know you guys will want to see pics anyway, these are the best ones I had easy access to.

**Stats:**

**Before:** 2015, age 19, height 6’3’’ (190 cm) weight: ?? (I’d guess 60-65 kg)

Deadlift: Untrained

Squat: Untrained

Bench: ~60 kg for a shaky double

Shoulder Press: ~20 kg for reps

**After:** 2021, age 26, height: 6’3’’ weight: 82-86 kg

4/3/2/1 baby!! 

**Motivation:**

I lift solely for my mental health, in 2015 I was diagnosed with depression and in 2020 I was also diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, I take antidepressants but lifting has changed my life. Lifting is the thing which keeps my mental health in check but also the fact that I am able to make small goals which are achievable within weeks really helps when my day-to-day life is working towards a goal which is a long way in the distance (like a PhD). Obviously it is nice to make some aesthetic improvements too but this is not my personal goal.

**Training History:**

Pre-University
As mentioned above I sporadically attended the gym (perhaps once or twice a month) from ages 17 through 19 but looking back, I made little progress in this time 

Undergraduate

When I began going to the gym as an undergraduate, I spent perhaps the first two years doing various forms of bro-split (think chest and tris, back and bis etc.). This sort of thing gets a really bad rep on this site and while it is true that bro-splits are not a very efficient way of training they do have their benefits, namely:

* Getting used to being in a gym – gyms are very scary for newcomers especially lanky emo kids, just getting used to being in that space can take time
* Getting used to being under a bar – although at this time my only real barbell exercise was the bench press, just getting used to holding something heavy in your hands is really important
* Ease and simplicity – with a Bro-split there is no pre-planning no spreadsheets, no faff, you just go to the gym and if it hits your chest and your tris and there’s no queue you go for it

The next program I ran was PHUL, at this point in my training I became aware that ‘training programmes’ existed and pretty much found the first one I could and did that. I would say that PHUL is a good programme for bodybuilding style training but probably this was not the right time in my training to do it, nonetheless I found the following benefits:

* Getting used to a programme/logging workouts
* Lots of variety so not too boring
* Definitely made gains faster than a bro-split 

There was also the following negatives:

* Lonnngggg workouts, especially when working out with a training partner

* Now, as someone interested in powerlifting I would class there as being a lot of unnecessary 
accessory movements and not enough focus on the main lifts (but that is very personal).

This brings me to around the end of my undergraduate degree so at this point I am 22 years old and my stats are around:
Deadlift: 100 kg
Squat: 80-90 kg
Bench: 80 kg
Shoulder Press: ~40kg for reps.

Grad-School

While there are some people who are able to maintain consistency while at grad-school I am not one of those people. In my first couple of years of grad-school especially it was not uncommon for me to work in the lab for a minimum of 9 am-7.30 pm every day and then also work for at least some of Saturday. Also due to the nature of experiments I had to stay until past 10 pm maybe 3 or 4 nights a month. This amount of work sucks but this post is not to complain about the life of a PhD scientist it is to talk about fitness. I am also in a long-distance relationship so about one weekend in every three I am not in my university city to train.

My ethos for my training in grad school has been, when you can train, train. This means that some weeks I am able to go 4 times in a week, some weeks I am able to only go once, some weeks I cant go at all. I have also had periods of months off for a wrist injury (not gym related), when I spent some time at a University in Asia and the dreaded COVID lockdowns (although I tried to do some home workouts with minimal equipment during these). Despite these setbacks I have been able to consistently increase in strength over the past 4 years, albeit slowly.

Programmes in Grad-School:

GZCL 

For the first couple of years of grad school I ran a GZCL style programme, I chose a 4 day split but as explained above, I was not able to be consistent with my frequency so sometimes that 4 day split happened in a week and sometimes it happened in 3 weeks.
Benefits

* My first powerlifting programme – enjoyed making consistent strength gains

* Lots of spreadsheets out there to make programming easy

* Lots of variety in rep and weight ranges so you don’t get bored

* I first hit my 100 kg bench and 180 kg deadlift during this time 

Negatives

* Sometimes you can progress faster than the programme dictates which can either lead to you being frustrated or having to mess with your spreadsheets

* Workouts can sometimes be quite long

5/3/1

I ran 5/3/1 for around a year pre-COVID and it has been by far my favourite programme. I ran a 4-day variant but as sated above this didn’t always happen in one week. 
Benefits 

* Easy programming

* Quick workouts

* Quick gains

* I first hit my 60 kg shoulder press during this programme

Negatives

* Assistance work can be boring

Making it up

Post-COVID it has been really hard to have any consistency, in the UK we have had several lockdowns and I have also had to do some personal isolation periods for close contact etc. I am also in the final year of grad-school so my busy schedule has been even busier, as such for the last year or so I have just been making it up in the gym (which I’m sure on /r/fitness will cause people to bring out the flaming torches). My routine now is just 2 days on repeat, one day in the gym I squat and bench, the next day I can go to the gym I deadlift and shoulder press. If I have a long time that day I will do a lot of accessory movements, If I don’t have a long time I will do my main lifts and get out. With regards to weight/reps I base it on how I feel that day, some days are heavier with less reps some days are lighter with more reps

Benefits

* Extremely flexible schedule 

* Requires no planning

* Easy to workout with others

* Finally reached my 140 kg squat

Negatives

* Slower progress than a real programme

* Sometime requires more ‘on the spot’ thought about what you’re gonna do.

**Cardio**

The only cardio I do is cycling to and from the lab for a total of about 30 minutes each day, I feel this is enough to keep my heart healthy while not killing my gains.

**Equipment**

You absolutely don’t need a bag full of fancy equipment to make gains the few things I use are chalk – to grip stuff, a belt to help get a better brace, wrist wraps if my wrists are playing up and lifting shoes which are not necessary but are a nice treat as they are very comfortable/sturdy/stable to squat in. 

**Diet**

As stated above I do not workout for aesthetics I work out for my mental health, as such my diet ethos has been eat as healthy as I can, and aim for just over my tdee until my belly gets to a size I’m not happy with and then eat just under my tdee until the belly goes. In practice this means I eat around 3300 calories a day when eating above and when eating below I eat around 2500 (usually achieved by skipping breakfast). I have adjusted these goal posts slightly as I have got heavier over the years. Also for the last two years I have been vegetarian not much has changed but my shits are generally better. 

**My thoughts from my own experience**

I hope from this post I have made it clear that not every fitness journey has to take the most efficient route. Could I have achieved these goals in two years with proper training and diet? Yes, probably. Would that have fit in with my life? Absolutely not. I have a busy life and I am not willing to sacrifice other parts of it such as socialising, working or sleeping, as such, I have fit in working out where possible and I have learned not to beat myself up if I can only get to the gym one time in a week. Not every person has to reach their genetic maximum as quickly as possible, if you are going to the gym and feeling good then don’t worry, you are doing good. 

**Advice for new lifters**

* Do your research, find a programme you like the sound of that you think will help you reach your goals

* Don’t get to caught up in ‘what is the absolute best thing for me’ – going to the gym 100% of the time will be better than not going 

* Don’t listen to the people who say ‘you can always fit in lifting you’re just lazy’ sometimes you cant fit in lifting or sometimes going to that party or going to bed early is more important and that's okay.

* Don’t beat yourself up – okay you’ve missed the lift, or you’ve missed a week of training or you’re not getting where you want as fast as you want, don’t worry, not everyone works in the same way, you’ll get there.

I hope that the good folk of /r/fitness have enjoyed reading about my journey and own personal takeaways and I’m happy to discuss anything I’ve said below but please be kind and civil <3

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out. 

  

---

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

**Many of the readers here in r/fitness are firmly in this category. Learn how to lift, and then move on as soon as you can.**    
  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)**  Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many readers here are in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.",fitness

"I really struggled with where to ask this question so I'm hoping mods are okay with me asking here.

I'm looking for a wearable heart rate monitor that I can use to see whether I'm in an aerobic or anaerobic range and to track some HIIT workouts.

Ideally I would like to be able to download the info to my laptop and view the data but I don't want a device that requires registering an account and viewing the data through an app or website that is going to talk to the cloud like a FitBit does.

It's a little hard to find that information when viewing products. Anyone else fitness minded and also privacy concerned that has some recommendations ?

"#Link to Article - [THE SECRET IS PATIENCE](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-secret-is-patience.html)

Once again, /u/mythicalstrength has his finger on the pulse and puts words to some things I've been ruminating on as well.  

The tldr should be pretty obvious: big changes in this space take time and persistence, but our modern day lifestyles and the marketing gimmicks that hack into them don't set up the uninitiated to be prepared for this stark reality.  

To add something of my own to the conversation, this lack of patience also seems to rob people of the satisfaction of the short term results they have achieved:  

""I've lost 16lb in 3 months and I'm not at my goal weight, where am I going wrong?""   

""I've been lifting for a year and despite improving my lifts greatly, my quads don't look like this professional bodybuilder's, what am I missing?""  

These people have achieved very real and very important successes, but because they have been blinded by the 'instant results' hoopla, they've denied themselves the gratification of this particular instant.  

We're all gonna make it, gang.  It's just gonna take time, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate successes along the way, too.",fitness

"What are people's thoughts on using a heavier-than-recommended Bulgarian bag?

It's generally used as a strength-endurance-cardio tool that is centred around lower back and core strength in the transverse plane, along with grip and shoulder endurance.

Usually you see the bag used for 10-12 reps, switch exercise, another 10-12 reps, repeat, through several exercises without rest.

I see this as something akin to doing barbell complexes, which are great, but not necessarily conducive to pure strength/power, and more of a strength endurance thing bordering on cardio/HIIT.

So what if one were to use a bag heavier than that recommended, sticking within a range where 4-8 reps would be max effort, then taking a break, then repeating for another 3-4 sets? It's normally recommended than a reasonably athletic male should start with a 12kg bag, then move to a 17kg then 22kg eventually. But I'm thinking of a scenario where one would begin with a 22kg and move potentially to a 30kg.

I guess one could also slow down the movements somewhat, focusing less on the skill of the movement and more on strength/time under tension. Another parallel; heavy kettlebells where movements such as the overhead press are performed seated and with strict form.

This matter is interesting to me because I don't see it explored much anywhere, and it is an incredibly versatile piece of equipment, and I love the core stability benefits offered in that transverse plane which is something that isn't targeted by conventional weight lifting programmes.

Thanks.",fitness
"Starting weight: 125 lb

Ending weight: 130 lb

Height: 5'6""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Diet: This is something I still struggle with, specifically getting my micros in. For the first 6 months of working out, I was eating around 1800-2300 calories and went up to around 134lb. The next 6 months were more about focusing on my protein intake and it's averaged to around 1800. I try to make sure I'm eating something with meat or eggs in it everyday and I have at least 50g of protein in me even on a bad diet day.

I'm currently planning to cut down 8-10lb and am going with the following caloric plan: 1600 calories (173g carbs, 134g protein, 34g fat). 

I'm using myfitnesspal to track and assign my macros and diet. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Exercise: I'm following a PPL split. I used to do 3 leg days, 1 back/ bis and 1 chest/tris/shoulders when I started out, but had to forego this routine after it just led to my legs not recovering fast enough and also not seeing enough upper body progress. Upper body is still a weak point for me, specifically with bench and anything to do with triceps. My current PPL looks like the below:

Back/Biceps - 5x5 DL, 4x12 Bent Over Row, 4x12 Seated Cable Row, 3x10 Hammer Curls, 3x10 Zottman Curls, 1-3 sets of 21s

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - 5x5 OHP, 4x8 Bench, 3x12 Tricep Cable Pulldowns, 3x12 Overhead Dumbbell Extension

Legs (Quads/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x12 Leg Extension

Rest Day

Back/Biceps

Chest/Triceps/Shoulders - same routine, but 5x5 bench first and then 4x8 OHP

Legs(Hamstrings/Glutes) - 3x8 Squat, 3x12 Hip Thrusts, 3x10 Bulgarian Split Squat, 3x10 Back Hyperextension, 3x12 Seated Leg Curl

I used to mainly rely on squats to build my legs at the start, but I realized this was a bad idea back in June as it led to a lot of quad dominance and was a factor in my knee injury. Focusing on isolated leg work like BSS has really helped with my knee pain and also helped increase overall definition of my legs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Lifts:

Diddly: 155lb 1RM (Starting lift - 60 lb)

Squat: 105lb for 3x8 (could go higher I think, but I injured my knee which set back progress. Don't want another repeat of that) (Starting lift - just the bar)

OHP: Bar for 5x6 (Starting lift - 5 lb dumbbells)

Bench: 65lb for 5x5 (Starting lift - 7.5 lb dumbbell press)

"Hello! 

As mentioned, this is my first post here, so I’ll just jump right in to it and explain.

I (male, 20’s) do a lot of different activities (mostly running, cycling, skating on ice, crossfit. High intensity is Key), but recently i’ve lost interest in doing these kind of activities alone. In fact, I think its straight up boring just having to do these things by myself. I want to share my training experience with somebody, talk about the training session, and so on. 
Its just about having someone interested in the same kind of things as me. If i want to do a hike in the mountains, i usually have to prepare myself that its just going to be me.

I have a girlfriend, but she doesn’t want to be involved in these high intensity training sessions. With her, i usually just walk. I also have some friends that I ask if want to join me, but they never want to.

I’m not even an extreme kind of training guy, i’m just average and want to be in physical activity. When I first started training, i didn’t care about being alone. But Now i think about training as some kind of experience, rather than some kind of personal goal. 

I dont how to solve this. 

QUESTIONS: Do any of you struggle with the same?How do you manage to exercise alone? 

I’d love to have your take on this.",fitness
"So I'm a total beginner to fitness (especially weight lifting) and haven't even gone to a gym yet, but I'm thinking about my fitnessplan at the moment. I don't want to grow muscles on my upper body, but mostly on my legs and glutes. I would just like to train my back a little for a better posture, but I don't see any reason to train my arms. But then again I'm worried it would look weird if I have a visibly trained lower body but untouched arms. I would want to tighten the muscles in my arms at least but I heard tightening muscles is a myth and I also don't understand what you do differently when you want to tighten muscles in contrast to growing them. Especially if I have to be in a caloric surplus to grow muscles on my legs and glutes, then how can I simultaneously tighten them on different places and not grow them. It would only make sense to me to be in a caloric deficit if you want to tighten muscles. But I have no idea, so please correct me if I'm wrong....",fitness

"**Summary:** Poor sleep may make you gain fat and lose muscle mass. If you are on a diet, you may lose fat slower.

**Sleep deprivation slows fat loss and burns muscle instead**

>Two studies have looked at the effects of sleep restriction in an energy deficit on body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) in adults \[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951287/); [23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324)\].  In these studies, all participants lost body weight. However, the  sleep deprived participants lost more fat-free mass (i.e muscle and  water).  
>  
>""We found that sleep restriction resulted in less loss of fat but greater loss of lean mass (...)."" - Wang et al. 2018 ([23](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/5/zsy027/4846324))

**Sleep longer for faster fat loss**

>The current evidence suggests that increasing sleep duration and quality is  beneficial for losing body fat. This might be because you are less likely to overeat, the longer you sleep \[[43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/)\].  
Three studies have found that sleeping longer is associated with reduced fat mass ([54](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32141273/), [43](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854682/), [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31983513/#:~:text=No%20differences%20in%20cortisol%20or,treatment%20of%20obesity%20in%20adolescents.)) (...)

**Energy balance**

>Overall, sleep restriction makes you more passive, thus expending less energy  (...)  Some researchers have concluded that energy expenditure is not  the primary component linking sleep deprivation to excess body fat, and  is  rather influenced by increased hunger and calorie intake \[[29](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23102177/); [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018785/)\].

"Hello everyone,
just finished a routine I'm planning to use when I'll return to the gym on January, and I would love your feedback if you have the time to do so.

### Me

* 27 years old, male
* 168 cm / 5 ft 6 in
* 73 kg / 161 lbs (just gained 3 kg due to holidays and not going to the gym in the past month :|)

* 1x power rack

Common machines not listed as they are out of topic.

### Routine

The gym is very busy as it's not that big, so the access to standard equipment is not always available :(

I've chosen to:

* splitting the work into more days
* performing skill training at the beginning of the workout
* 3x days a week, On-Off, might do some cardio/skill on the weekend
* using deadlifts and barbell squats. Those will be performed first, as I prefer to do them well rested

#### Routine A

* Back Lever skill training
* Deadlift 3x5 120s
* Horizontal Row / Barbell Rows^1 3x10 90s
* Push Ups^3 3x12 90s
* Elevated Pike Push Ups 3x12 90s
* Leg/Knee^2 Raises 3x10 90s
* Side Plank 2x60s 90s
* 15-30 min cardio (low-mid intensity)

#### Routine B

* L-Sit skill training
* Barbell Squat 3x6 120s
* Assisted Pull Ups 3x5 120s
* Dips 3x10 90s
* Horizontal Row / Barbell Rows^1 3x10 90s
* One Arm Push Ups (progression) 3x4-5 120s
* Decline Sit Ups 3x10-15 90s
* Plank 3x60s 90s

^1 I'll try to do horizontal rows at the racks, otherwise I'll fallback to barbell rows.

^2 Will peform leg raises as much as I can, and then fallback to knee raises

^3 Will gradually substitute push ups with one arm push ups","bodybuilding, fitness"

"I’m looking for some advice on maintaining good cardio while having decent muscle mass. I obviously know it takes a lot more work to oxyginate muscle versus fat, so the more muscular you are, the harder cardio can be. 

I’m a 5’10 female and I am usually 170-180 (depending on what kind of working out I’m doing). I have a lean build, aside from my chest and hips. 

I have been training nothing but cardio for the last month and a half to prepare for a PT test. Through this, I have dropped a lot of muscle weight, but it seems no matter how much I run and how much weight I drop, it’s so hard for me to improve my run times. This has been a struggle for my entire life. I’m not sure if this is a common issue with other people or if I may have some kind of medical condition going on.

"Tl;Dr: Is there a specific way to call the side aspect of calisthenics done on the floor in a flowing manner, like GMB or Animal Flow?

I started my fitness journey several years ago as an overweight person. I always felt like bodyweight fitness was the way to go, but I sincerely couldn't pull anything in my sad condition. Instead, I passionately started powerlifting, then moved to kettlebells at the beginning of the pandemic. I am now so many pounds lighter (30kg/65lbs) and younger as a 40yo dad than I have ever been. Never really cared about hypertrophy anyway.

I have discovered Animal Flow several months ago, then moved to GMB that I absolutely love. Finishing GMB Elements at the moment. While still a beginner, I have good mobility and sufficient strength to progress rapidly and pull tricks I am humbly pretty proud of.

Therefore, I would like to explore this aspect of calisthenics further: flowing, crawling, having fun on the floor and moving from one pose to the next in an ""effortless"" manner. How should I search for new ideas on the interweb? Calisthenics as a keyword brings a lot of stuff with rings and implements that I am less interested in.

Also, I would be very grateful if you fine people could recommend YT channels and stuff around what I described.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello everyone, my stats are as follows (so that this post isn’t removed): M 177cm/5’9.5 and 77kg/170lbs. I’ve been lifting weights for several years (been following a structured routine for only the last 1.5 years). I can do bodyweight +150lbs dips so I have a good amount of pushing strength and one arm pushups are not a challenge for my triceps or pecs.

The discussion I want to start comes from the observation that whenever I do one-arm pushups, I feel intense doms in my obliques the next day. This is obviously because of the intense strain on the obliques to prevent the body from twisting and collapsing during the movement. I haven’t felt this much strain on my obliques for any other movement despite training obliques consistently through other exercises such as woodchoppers, windshield wipers, and side planks.

My main question is: does anyone have experience with performing one-arm pushups as an exercise to mainly train and induce hypertrophy in obliques? 

As a followup, is there a similar bodyweight exercise that stresses the obliques as much? Right now, the only ones that comes to my mind (apart from ridiculous moves like one arm front lever or planches) are the human flag or a twisted dragon flag","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I know you can do those in a smith rack but I don't have the space/money for it.

I remember you could buy these oversized 3-4ft tall pushup handles for doing dips which you could also use for doing reverse pushups (aka australian pullup or bodyweight row)

But is there any common name to refer to this equipment? I'm finding it a real pain to do searches on places I can order them online.

Vagely remember some guide on how you can make your own buying PVC pipe from a hardware store like Home Depot but can't find it again...

Also I'm over 250 so PVC would make me a bit nervous, I think I'd prefer metal even if that means it's heavier to cart around, just so I know it won't snap.

I used to have this setup where I had a steel bar I'd balance across some cinderblocks I had stacked up but this was very wobbly and unsafe so I ended up dismantling it. Looking for ""bars all the way"".","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Like many people, I've started a workout routine this year. I've taken one big lesson to heart: **The best fitness routine is the one you actually do.** So I've realized that I can do a five minute warmup workout first thing in the morning, and a 10-15 minute workout after work, and I've been sticking to it 5 days a week so far. It fits my schedule, I haven't burned myself out trying to do more than I can do.

My issue is rest and recovery. I'm trying to do strength workouts one day, alternate cardio the next. I don't like running, and it's too cold to jump rope, so I'm doing burpees and mountain climbers and such. But, since I'm not lifting weights, it's like I'm doing the same exercises every day.

Yes, I'm overthinking it. Yes, I know I'm talking about a 10 minute workout, not training like The Rock. Building good habits is more important right now than the minutiae of hypertrophy and triglycerides.

Basically, I want to know if I'm overtraining myself doing HIIT workouts that work the whole body, with one day focusing on building strength and the next focusing on speed.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello, i have a question. I train calisthenics for like year now, i was training with weights in the gym before. I dont train for skills, but for hypertrophy/strenght, so im progressing by adding weight. I follow PPL split and i personally like less exercises with higher volume (so 1 variation of vertical pull, 1 variation of horizontal etc.). Same for my push-day, i do 1x dips and 1x push-ups. The thing is, as i said i train mainly for hypertrophy, so with just dips and regular push-ups i will definitely grow good chest, but im just missing those incline benches from gym for upper chest ( i mean every muscle building program has incline pushing).

With calisthenics, for upper chest pushing, there are decline push-ups. Some people say its upper chest exercise like incline dumbell press for example, some say its harder variation of regular push-ups, some say they completely sucks because shoulders and triceps are heavily activated and you get almost simillar upper chest activation with regular push-ups.

I tried them and i feel like they are more ""compound"" and just less isolating than incline presses, but they are still target that upper chest little bit more than regular push-ups i guess. 

So my question is, do you think i can do dips+decline push-ups on PUSH day, could i do decline push-ups completely instead of regular ones, or the upper chest activation is not that big with decline a i will be better with sticking to regular push-ups ? What do you think ? Thanks","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I am stuck and at a loss of ideas on how to move forward.

I weigh about 180lbs. Using about +25% BW I can do 5x5 (Shoulder Width, Overhand) - tried going for 4x6 but got 5 and 4 on the last two sets. I recently hit 6x3 with the same weight using a Close grip. If I perform Underhand Close grip I can almost hit 3x8 with the same weight. I've also done 6x3/arm with the same weight using an ""Uneven"" grip. 
For max weight, I can do 3x2 using about +50% BW with an Underhand grip and hands a few inches apart.

It took me roughly a year to work up to this level with a twice a week training session.

BW wise, I can do 15 pullups in a set (Shoulder Width, Overhand grip) and 20 chinups in a set (Underhand, Close grip). I have experimented with many different types of assisted one arm chinups. Band/Towel assisted (off hand holding lower to the point where at the end of the pull I'm essentially pushing down with my off hand). Uneven (to the point where my off hand is above my pulling hand's elbow). I've tried holding the doorframe with my off hand at head and shoulder height level.

At one point I could jump to the top of the bar using an Underhand grip, let go and come down a few inches before pulling back up. Can't seem to do that now for some reason... I've also tried slow half and full one arm negatives using Underhand grip.

How can I move forward to actually get a one arm chinup???","bodybuilding, fitness"

I have a dumbell that goes up to 50lbs, backpack, and a doorway pull up bar that I also use as paralettes. I wanted to include weighted pushups using my dumbell and my backpack but after trying them out in my workout, the dumbell moves around when I get into the pushup position and I'm just worried it'll cause imbalances or injuries?

Especially cause I'm doing them with ""paralettes"" so more rom idk maybe I'm overthinking it but when the dumbell shifts a tiny bit during my pushup i feel like I'm doing it wrong.

"Hey everyone, I've been doing the RR for over a year and really enjoyed the progress I've made. Recently, I've noticed a slight pain in my right shoulder when doing certain exercises, so I backed off bodyweight to let it heal and replaced it with a routine of 30 mins of yoga in the morning and a swim at lunchtime most weekdays. On the weekend I'll do some yoga on one of the days. My shoulder has started to feel better from this. Additionally, I've found the routine much easier to maintain and other stressed areas of my body (hips and lower back) also feel much better.

I'd like to eventually reincorporate some bodyweight elements back into this routine as I don't really want to lose strength, but I'm not overly concerned with gaining loads of additional strength. The exercises I'd like to maintain are pull ups and pushups mostly. 

So I'm thinking I will either do a short routine to do after yoga on three of the days. I'd like to keep this routine to about 30 minutes. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to structure this exercise? As most of the routines on here are over an hour.

I'm thinking perhaps a really short split routine.

Day 1 - Push
Archer / planche - 3x8
Diamond - 3x8
Dips - 3x8
Decline - 3x8

Day 2 - Pull
Pull ups - 3x8
Bodyweight bicep curls - 3x8
Rows - 3x8
Isometric pull up holds - 3 sets

Day 3 - Shoulders
Handstand practice
Pikes - 3x8
Pseudo planche pushup - 3x8
Scapula push up - 3x8

I'm thinking of just including some squats and lunges in the rest periods and the yoga is decent core exercise for what I'm after.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"This year I hope to keep training strength consistently. As a realistic goal I'm going to hold myself to at least two workouts a week. I lead a really active lifestyle and have a weird work schedule so keeping a good workout schedule is difficult.

I've not been too interested in skills work until recently. I think it would be a good motivator to try to finally get some cool skills down that I've neglected. This year I want to achieve a consistent press handstand. My main obstacle here is going to hamstring flexibility. I've always struggled so much with my flexibility. If I don't consistently stretch I literally cannot touch my toes or hold my legs straight out in front of me, for instance in an L-Sit pull up (which is an exercise I love but always do with knees bent). So mini-goal is hamstring flexibility and mega-goal is press handstand. I don't quite have the shoulder strength but I love pushing and getting that part of the skill will be fun for me.

Next skill goal is a full front lever. I can tuck front lever for around 45 seconds at this point so I think with consistent training here I can achieve a solid few seconds of full front lever by the end of the year.

Finally I REALLY want to get a muscle up. I think I'm really close here. I can bang out deep ring dips and chest to bar pull ups with good form pretty well at this point. I've been trying to train the transition part of the muscle up but it's really a crux move still. I think I need to get a stronger false grip so I'm going to focus on that. I may also be looking to purchase weights for my dips and pull-ups. Anyone have recommendations for products? Should I get a vest or a belt with plates?

Anyway thanks for reading. What are your goals for 2022?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello, i need some clarification about a thing in pullups, i do the entire movement, and come back down and unlock my shoulder blades every time to do another one.

I saw that my friends (that can do a higher number of them than i do) dont seem do go fully down and extend their arms, instead they go down enough not to unlock their shoulder blades again each time.

They tell me that im doing the right movement, but in my fashion, i feel like im wasting my strength in constantly reopening by fully extending my arms.

Who is correct here? Should i learn to unlock them once in the 1st pullup and then keep them locked, or should i keep going full extension and unlocking them each time?

"Hi guys. Not related to bodyweight fitness specifically, but a question I've always wondered about.  
We all know that if you want to gain weight you need to eat more than you use and vice versa.  
But what is the difference between 2 people in these cases.  
Both people are 75 kg.   
Let's say one of them has a tdee of 2400 calories and exercises normally.  
The other one however is extremely active and has a tdee of 3500.  
Both eat enough to maintain.  


What is the difference between the two? One of them is doing a lot more exercise than the other. Would they have different body composition? Strength? Endurance?  


What if they were cutting or bulking?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello. I’m 19 male, 82kg at around 16-19% bodyfat. My english can sometimes suck because I’m not a native speaker, so sorry about that. I recently made a post here about why am I losing my pull up gains so fast whenever I’m not practicing them. There’s what that post was for short: If for some reason if I don’t do any pull ups in the span of 2-3 days I lose around 4 reps from my PR and it takes me a week of daily pull ups do regain my strength back. 


In order to maintain my PR I need to do at least 2 sets per day (usually till failure) and if I want to improve I do several sets a day. If I really go at it I would do 15 sets of different pull up variations in a single workout (3x10 chin ups; 3x10 normal pull ups; 3x10 wide pull ups; 3x10 neutral grip pull ups and 3x10 close grip pull ups). However, I got told in the comments I’m overtraining and doing myself more harm than good with this kind of training. 


I got told I should switch to weighted pull ups only with a weight with I can limit myself to 3 sets of 10 reps. I workout around 4-5 times per week at the gym and I usually do some cardio after each of my workouts. What I want tho, is to take it a step further with callisthenics and get into harder elements. Honestly I’ve been neglecting everything, but the pull ups. I just love doing pull ups, but again, I want to achieve things like the planche, front lever, human flag, one arm pull ups, etc one day. 


Here’s where I’m at now in terms of my callisthenics PR’s: 23 chin ups, 20 pull ups, 34kg x 3 weighted chin ups, 3 minutes and 20 seconds dead hang, 11 dips, 45 push ups, 4 minutes plank, 6 pistol squats, 2 decent form muscle ups (both hands over the bar at the same time), 11 bad form muscle ups (with my left hand over the bar first) and I can get myself in the front lever position, but I can’t hold it for more than a second or so. I can also do a lot of different variations of those exercises but I’m not gonna list everything. 


I have a pull up bar at home and somebody recommended me to get some rings, are they worth it? What other products like this I should get? How should I incorporate my bodyweight exercises into my workout routine? So far I’ve been just doing pull ups every day, push ups and plank whenever I remembered and I’ll sometimes randomly search for callisthenic workouts on YouTube and doing them. 


Should I add some bodyweight exercises into my gym workouts? Or should I just have bodyweight workouts all together? I’ve been adding arm wrestling exercises into my arms workouts too. So I’m now already doing 3 different kinds of workouts and I’m starting to get very lost on how to organise them. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"As a lot of us have no doubt seen there was a big drive on bracing inwards or exhaling completely whilst ab training to avoid ‘bread loaf abs’.

Personally I’ve found that if I spend a good amount of time fully expanding my belly or bracing outwards I actually have this great core activation, especially the obliques. 

I get why you need to exhale to get a great flexion and crunch of the rectus abdominis but could some of us need to train our abs in more of an extended position?

Exhale, flexion and crunch definitely trains the abs. 

But could an inhale and brace train the abs in a more functional way, especially for those with poor posture. 

Anecdotally, dedicated ab workouts with more flexion based exercises and that cinched aesthetic after makes me feel a lot less stable than bracing and non cinched ab workouts. 

Feel like I subconsciously tighten my stomach in everyday life which restricts my breathing. 

Spending half hour focusing on expansion and tensing my abs definitely helps my posture.

Those that subconsciously hold in their stomach are likely compensating for a weak overall core, IE weak glutes or hamstrings at the base of the core. Lower abs and stomach tightens inwards to compensate restricts the diaphragm from moving optimally therefore this laboured shallow and rapid chest breathing that many of us have.

"Hi guys, 

Longtime lurker here looking for some advice. 

I created this workout in May this year and I have been using it 3 times a week, occasionally missing the odd day. I feel that I’m now not progressing as much as I would like so I would love some information on how to switch things up and get more gains. 

Here is the workout- 

Workout 1
10x ring push-ups 
10x ring chest flys 
10x pull ups
10x pull up rows 
10x squats
20x calf lifts 
45 second plank 

Workout 2 
10x (wide/narrow) incline push-ups  
10x (ring)dips
20 second ring holds
10x chin ups/narrow grip
10x underhand rows
10x tricep dips 
45 second hip hinge 
12 x hanging leg raises

Back to day 1…

I do these workouts Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So I would alternate the workouts every other day. 

I have thought about making some of the moves harder such as archer push-ups, pistol squats etc. 

Any input on how to improve my gains would be a great help, many thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm 16 M and I am an active person doing workouts 5-6 a week using my body weight. I am 5'3 and weigh 128 which is a healthy weight. I'm here to ask about the protein intake I'm taking daily because recently I read an article (Forgot the title) that too much protein could harm my kidney. 4 per kilogram is about 228 grams of protein daily but I sometimes could go a little higher around 250. I am clean bulking; not eating crappy foods such as fast foods but I do eat lean meats and mostly dairy for my diet. My protein came from dairy mostly; 1 cup of cottage cheese at night, 2 cups of greek yogurt, and about 2/5 of low-fat milk, also some 6 pieces of Tyson's chicken breast strips which I cook in an oven. I don't know for sure if this protein intake can cause any harm to my body in the long term but I have only done this 2 weeks ago and have never seen any significant symptoms of any sickness but instead seen an improvement in my physique and have gotten stronger lifting weights and can perform more sets and reps than consuming less protein before. Is this okay if I gonna keep this journey forward or shall I just decrease my protein intake to reduce the ""might"" consequences in the future? Provide at least evidence of why protein high protein intake can harm kidneys. I will fully appreciate yall answers down below people.

"Hi, I tend to hurt my shoulders pretty easily when bouldering, especially on moves and holds that put the shoulder in an uncomfortable position. I have not managed to isolate which exact muscle is the problem, but I've noticed that moves that demand strength while being in heavy shoulder internal rotation, moves that force a ""chicken wing"" arm position as well as gastons often induce a sharp pain at the back of my shoulder (which sometimes resorbs itself quickly, and sometimes lasts for a few days). It feels like a muscular issue more than tendon or ligament related, so I suspect weakness in one or several muscles of the shoulder complex, but I'm unsure which.

Here are a few photos of positions that I reckon would probably cause me discomfort or pain:

I do calisthenics besides bouldering, and my upper body routine usually revolves around a few skills + the 4 basics (chin-ups or pull-ups, bodyweight rows, pushups or dips, pike push-ups). I consider my scapular stability to be pretty good in the context of calisthenics, and the only ""imbalance"" I have noticed is that I believe my overhead pressing strength (pike push-ups) to be slightly lacking compared to the other 3 movements. I do have a pretty solid handstand though, and good shoulder flexion ROM.

I have not done any dedicated rotator cuff training so far, but I think I may need to start doing some to prevent more shoulder pain and potentially serious injuries down the road. Any idea what specific muscle/movement pattern I need to reinforce, and some exercises to do so ? cc u/eshlow, as I know you have a lot of experience in this domain and in climbing","bodybuilding, fitness"
"**30(M), 5'8""**

This is a candid photo my friend clicked while I was talking with others after lunch: https://imgur.com/6O28gWN

I know my posture is fucked up. I face a myriad of issues. Starting from mild indigestion, easily getting tired after doing a few chores, searching for chairs in parties, etc. All these happened due to free internet and a large monitor which I purchased. Spending almost the entire day in front of the desk hunched over. 

I have noticed another thing with my lower body. When I sit in a chair, my legs tend to go outwards. Like keeping them straight takes real effort. I believe it is some form of manspreading. Is it because my inner leg muscles are weak too? Or are my leg muscles overworked because of my frail upper body, they have to bear the entire load?

How to fix this and be strong and fit? Like a normal moving human being. Is the RR sufficient or do I need to focus on something special? Mental barrier to starting something new is also a thing after having spent a sedentary lifestyle for so long (almost 5 to 6 years). 

Assessing from the photo can anyone identify what the problems are? Like which portion/muscle is tight, weak or whatever? I just want to know. How did it come to this? I am really shaken by this photo.

I (33, male, 60kg at 171) recently started working out again and I'm following the RR. I have worked out in the past and am not a complete beginner. My goal is to gain muscle and finally getting a physique I can be proud of.
So first of all thanks to this community for putting together all that information for people like me. It helps a lot.

I have a specific question regarding the pull up progression. I can do 4-5 regular pull ups on rings with proper form. However, I first began with negatives, since I don't see myself doing 3 sets of 5 regulars. When I do 3 sets of regulars, reps decrease over the sets and I end up with only 2 or 3 in the last set. 
Is that still better than sticking to negatives, or does that mean I'm just not ready for regular pull ups in my routine.
And adding to that, when would I change from negatives to regulars. 
And is there a progression for negatives in itself, since they can be quite differently challenging depending on how long you take to go down.

Many questions, thanks in advance.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello,

So I've been training for about a year now and definitely made good strength gains following the rr. I often find myself getting out of breath after a single set(say pullups I do somewhere between 9-11 reps a set). I find that I need to rest for a much longer time than ideal and often spend more time on my workouts then I'd like. 

To give you some numbers, I'll do a set of pullups, rest 3 mins do shrimp squats then I'll end up resting 5+ minutes before I do pullups again because I'm so out of breath. What are some good ways to build up work capacity so I stop getting so out of breath. Would being really strict with my rest times help? It would probably be a struggle and I'd imagine i put up lower numbers but overtime surely I'd adapt?

I was also thinking of maybe just throwing in a set of max rep bw squats at the end of each workout. My thinking is this would build up my work capacity as I'd be doing 50+ reps and I'd get some nice leg endurance too which is always good for hiking and sports.","bodybuilding, fitness"

I've always used the machines and not so much free weights for my lower body. I have been able to get my hands on resistance bands, booty bands, 2 3kg dumbbells and a stability ball. But I'm completely lost and don't know where to start with a routine that's not weight focussed.

- glute bridge
- hamstring curl (stability ball)
- backwards lunges
- step ups
- Bulgarian split squats (with dumbells)

"So I have recently just finished a workout program from a calisthenics athlete and was able to unlock the muscle up, frontlever, one arm push up(although form is questionable), one arm row and at least 5 secs free-standing handstand.

I'm now trying to train for the one arm pullup, full planche and handstand pushup and these are the workouts I do in a week.

Mon: 1×15m Handstand routine; 4×3-8r One arm negative pullups with bands; 4×3-8r tuck planche press

Tue: 1×15m Handstand routine; 4×3-8r Archer pullup; 4×3-8r tuck planche pushup (any exercise to replace this exercise would be much appreciated)

Wed: 4×3-8r Frontlever pulls; 4×3-8r Wall handstand pushup; 4×3-8r leg workout(probably squats, thinking of incorporating weight)

Fri: 1×15m Handstand Routine; Frontlever hold 4×5-10s; 4×10-15s Tuck planche hold

Sat: 4×8-15r One arm row; 4×3-8r One arm pushup; 4×3-8r leg workout(haven't decided on one yet but suggestions would be appreciated).

Is this a viable workout and if it is not, what should I change?

Thanks in advance for the advice

"When I do ab workouts, I have to stop based on pain and burning of my ab muscles, but not in the same way as other muscles.

For example, if I do push-ups to failure I literally cannot do the movement from pure muscle fatigue. My muscles just will not do the work and it's impossible to lift myself up, but not from a sensation of pain or burning. My muscles just will not do it.

But when I do ab exercises, I have to stop just from the sheer burning sensation, but seems like if I'd be able to push through that pain I'd be able to continue for longer. I also feel like I can't breathe well and have to take conscious deep breaths after I stop to relieve the pain in my abs before I can continue again.

Why is there such a big difference here in the experience of muscle fatigue, and is what I'm experiencing normal? Is it safe to try to try mental conditioning to push through that pain to try to prolong the exercise?

I don’t have any other door frames that would allow me to hang the bar from a greater height, and I can’t drill or mess with any walls to install cables/rings which is why I would like to hang them from my bar.

Does anyone know of any rings I should purchase and what the ideal length of the straps would be? I’d also prefer to not spend more than 30ish dollars as I’m a beginner and I don’t think it’s worthwhile to be spending a fortune on any equipment at this stage. Thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"28 M trying to learn the elbow lever. Every time I attempt my elbows slip out from under me. I have worked with hands right up against each other facing forward, back, to the sides and slightly pointed every direction. My waist is extremely small for my shoulders to the point people often think I’m built more than I actually am. Even just putting them in position when standing sucks as my arms squeeze against my pecs. 
I have done band dislocate stretches and eagle arms thinking it may be a flexibility thing to no avail. Leaning forward more has not helped either. Admittedly even after watching and reading all the tutorials I feel clueless as to what I’m doing but maybe that’s just because it’s supposed to be easy.

So while on YouTube today I stumbled upon this bodyweight variation of the leg extension exercise that looks quite clever. Frankly I'm kicking myself for never thinking this one up. Does anyone have experience using this exercise or similar ones for quad isolation during bodyweight leg exercises. I'm wondering if this is worthwhile to implement in my routine, or just something to use when I am in a hotel room with zero equipment. 

My biggest question is how to play with leverage and/or exercise bands resistance in a way that makes this exercise able to be progressed for those with intermediate to advanced leg strength.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello all.

According to calculators my (aproximately) maintenance calorie intake is about 2200kcal (175cm at 75kg).

I have a little bit of fat, I'd say I'm like the 16-19% percentage guy in this pic [https://imgur.com/a/2AUerzZ](https://imgur.com/a/2AUerzZ) maybe a little bit more but definitely not like the next guy.

So I tried to lose a bit of fat going down to 1800kcal, it worked for a bit. Then I dropped it to 1700 to keep losing the remaining fat but the fat stayed the same and I just lost muscle mass and strength, but not really that much weight, weird.

So after months of deficit I tried to gain muscle again because, well, I wanted to do cool calisthenic things and I couldn't advance if I was in deficit, right? So I pumped it to 2100-2200kcal daily, which is my maintenance, and zig-zagged it with two days of about 2500-2600 kcal for a surplus.

Well, nope, I thought the surplus was quite small (two days of +400 weekly would be like +115 daily) but I'm seeing myself gaining fat. Of course one explanation is my metabolism adapted to the lower intake, but even with that the surplus would be what, +200/300? I didn't start it too long ago (like 3 weeks ago max) and I already think my fat is more visible.

Any suggestions? Checked:  
\- Enough sleep.

\- Enough protein.

\- Low fries/sugar intake (but I'm weak, I'm not saying no to my chocolate bar as long as it's not more than 100-150kcal).

My training sessions are 3 days of recommended routine with 4 series instead of 3 for the three pairs.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi,

New to this, but I can manage maybe three push ups, before my left arm just gives. I specifically feel as if there is too much weight on my elbow and the muscle at the rear up my arm (shoulder->elbow) just isn't there. The other side feels strong. I'm not sure why but I think the following is an issue.

I have poor shoulder mobility, mainly from pinched nerve in my neck from bad posture. For example my right arm can stretch up vertically, while the left gets about 75% the way there, also turning my neck to the left, it just stops at a certain point. I know about chin tucks and mobility exercises but they honestly don't seem to help the push ups.

Can anyone help me get back and stay on track.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"A friend has asked me to give her son some tips on weights as he wants to put on some weight. They know he's still very young, so just want some very light tips.  They spoke about light dumbbells, etc

I've only used rings and bodyweight for the last 5 years and think they would be a far better piece of equipment to start with (less chance of injury).  He can learn pulls, rows, push ups... then build up to the more fancy stuff.  Plus I think weights will just end up sitting on his bedroom floor doing nothing.

But, can anyone give me advice or tips / point me in the right direction of any bodyweight guides for someone of his age?  I don't want to give him terrible advice that could potentially damage his growth.  Also, and I think what's most important, any advice on something fun for him and that he has more chance to stick with.

Any advice gratefully received.  Thank you (I think i'll get him rings as his Christmas present)","bodybuilding, fitness"

"So, I asked a friend of mine who does a lot of bodyweight, to give me a weekly schedule which can, in theory, make me stronger, faster, and more agile for parkour and similar activities including jumping high, sprinting short distances, etc. and he gave me this one:

**DAY 1:**  

Tri-Set One: Push Ups(3x20)- Jumping Lunges(3x20)- L-Sit Hold(3x30”)

Tri-Set Two:Dips(3×15)-Hanging Knee Raises(3×15)-Half Burpees(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Chin Ups(3×10)-Sit Ups(3×20)-Glute Bridges(3×10)

**DAY 2:**

Tri-Set One: Wide to Close Push Ups(3×20)-Wide to Close Squats(3×20)-Supermans(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Tricep Extensions(3×12)-Reverse Crunches(3x20)-Inch Worms(3×10)

Tri-Set Three: Pull Ups(3×10)-Toes to Bar(3×20)-Alternating Pistol Squats(3×10)

**DAY 3:**

Tri-Set One: Decline Push Ups(3×20)-Box Jumps(3×10)-Hollow Hold(3×30”)

Tri-Set Two: Plank to Push Ups(3×15)-Bicycle Crunches(3×30)-Flutter Kicks(3×50)

Tri-Set Three: Wide Grip Pull Ups(3×10)-Wall Climbs(3×20)-Plank Hold(3xFailure)

&#x200B;

Each one of these days is accompanied by a warm up run (I plan on running 20-30'). In between these, he said I could either do endurance cardio, mobility or martial arts and keep it 5-6 days a week.

I want to know your opinion as well. 

Is it good in terms of specificity, or just a generic program he gave me, to get rid of me (possible scenario!) ? 

What changes can I do to make it better for my goal?

"So, I tried ring holds a few weeks ago, and i ended up pinching one of my nerves under my armpits, which took a while to heal, and I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I think it happens on the dismount, but it could also be how I set up my rings. I'd like to continue using the rings because they are so versatile and they are generally fun to use. I tried to look on Google but no one had the same problem I had. I've been working out seriously for a year.

Dismount:

 - I basically dismount very fast, by quickly bending my arms and landing on my feet. this is where the pain comes when i had the pinched nerve

Setup:

 - Rings are set up in my bedroom doorway hung on my pull-up bar.
 - my doorway is about 4-5 inches wider than me (my shoulders specifically).

What I'm trying to ask is, how should i dismount from the rings and is how i set up my rings okay?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I want to have a routine that I can keep doing for the rest of my life. I'm 6'2"", 130 lb, and in my early 20s.

I have lots of free time these days, but I'll surely get busier in the future. This is why I don't like doing the recommended routine, and would instead prefer a split routine, where I'd be exercising up to half an hour a day.

I already take a walk (~1 hour) every day and go for a run (every 3 days or so). I'm thinking of working my upper body and core in a single day; legs, glutes, back, and shoulders the next day. I believe I can keep doing this with no rest days, so I can exercise all the body parts I listed about 3 times a week.

How does this routine sound? I'm worried running will make me too tired for legs exercise, but I can't see anything wrong with it otherwise. I can obviously switch the days of core and back/shoulders exercises.

Someone was kind enough to provide me with the routine below but it's mostly for upper body, so I can't stick with it.

3 sets with 60 seconds in between ever set and 120 seconds in between each round (notated by letters A-C) of A) 5x knee pushups, B1) 8x diamond incline pushups, B2) 8x wall pushups, C1) 10 second pushup hold (at the bottom of the pushup position), C2) 45 second plank, C3) 8x each side shoulder taps

"For example if Big Ramy got edged out this year by Brandon it’ll be like damn he was slightly off compared to last year but he looked good and Brandon deserved it but good for him and Brandon they battled good this year. But if he lost to Phil this year the amount of frustration for not being peeled like old times or happiness for edging out Phil if you hate phil would be way more intense. Kind of like if you hate or love Tom Brady or the cowboys.

So I’ve been trying to get back into fitness recently, and I’ve decided that starting on the 1st I will start working out every day and try to reach my “dream physique” by the end of May. I have a lot of resolutions I plan to keep throughout the new year, and so I’m really trying to keep my motivation up and make it to may with that goal in mind. My dream physique is an overall more defined and built muscles all around, as well as a six pack( if that’s possible lol). I got skinny forearms and calves that I’m really self conscious about, so I really want to bulk those up too. Last year I was really skinny, I weighed 80lbs and was a twig. I dirty bulked up to 150, and I worked out up until school started, which I then stopped and my physique that I gained was gone, as well as the ability to do normal workouts like push ups and pull ups. Now that I’m planning on starting to workout again, I need help finding a workout program that’ll get me to my goal by the end of may. I have 10,15,20,&25 lbs weights, a pull-up bar, a strong resistance and that I can use, along with multiple grip strengtheners. I know the first thing in getting fit is diet, so eating healthy and tracking my calories is something I already hav planned out, but I still need a workout plan. Rn I’m thinking of trying out Igor voitenkos plans, but I really need something that’ll help me reach my goals by the end of may. I like planning things out and knowing what workouts I’m gonna do in advance, bc it is overall easier for me to stick to something if I already have a plan.

During the first while I got pain in most places, shoulders, chest and triceps (maybe even lats). Obviously I expect that.

I refuse to believe after over 4 years of doing this exercise, that my triceps are still ""just weak"", surely there is something wrong right? Anyone else experience this, if so, how did you fix it?

"For those of you in the RR. What are your thoughts on bicep curls after the workout. I was watching a recent Fitness Faq video where daniel stated that strong and big biceps help to alleviate and strengthen the elbows. Which in turn should help reduce the risk of elbow injury and tendinitis.

Personally I do feel like the RR hits the biceps good enough. However I think I’m going to incorporate them after my RR workouts just because I enjoy being at the gym, and I want to see how the RR has affected my bicep strength.

"Hello guys,

I'm 47 and always trained on and off. Some periods with weights and some others bodyweight (and yes, a few years ago I did follow Foundation for more than a year). A little more than a year ago, I was consistently going to the gym, but with gyms opening and closing, I unexpectedly took up running.

I now run pretty much every day (maybe 26 out of 28 in a 4 weeks period) and I'm trying to make sure that I do at least 20 minutes of static stretching per day (I stopped doing it for a few months and I paid dearly in flexibility and I also got some pain in my heels, but now that I'm stretching regularly again things are improving, even though my range of motion is still way less than before starting running).

The result of all of this is that I haven't done strength training in a year. Also, because of bad eating habits, I'm probably 10kg heavier than I should be.

Long preamble to ask for suggestions on how to gradually get back in strength training at home.

I need something doable, because with 45m-1h running every day and stretching every day (and these two are my priorities), if I start a routine that is too demanding is not going to stick. Also, my running program is very varied (different speeds, sprints, intervals, etc...) so I'm not sure that I even need any additional leg work.

I'm looking at the minimalist routine as a good option. What do you guys think? And also, how many times per week and how many circuits would be best in my situation?

My goal are strength and health.

Thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"

Hey everyone. I lost a lost of weight in the past 2 years. I stuck to 1200 calories for a year and recently fell off the wagon, eating many desserts etc. A month ago I decided to start focussing on getting stronger to see change in my body because although I lost lots of weight, I felt fat. I suppose because I have never been toned in my life. While I loved being super slim, I realised I was just weak and felt fragile. I want to be strong now! I'd really appreciate if someone could help point me in the right direction in terms of calorie intake. Ive been eating around 1300-1500 calories daily. I work out about 5 days in the week. But by workout, I mean at home and it's barely as intense as what I've seen others do. I do 30mins brisk walking on the treadmill (varying between 5-7mph) and do about three 15 minute workouts beforehand that I just find on YouTube focussing on abs, arms and legs, but low impact because I do cardio on the treadmill. I was so proud of myself when I hit the week mark of working out because i powered through the DOMS for the first time in my life instead of giving into the pain and never trying again. Now I feel pain during a workout but rarely the day afterwards. I am 62kg (I think,  after eating im around 65kg) 5""9, female and my sedentary TDEE is around 1750 calories. These calculators have parts where you can say you're slightly active, but I really don't know if my workouts are even considered exercise that requires higher calorie intake. This is really new to me and I cant seem to make sense of it all.","bodybuilding, fitness"

So I have posts here a few types before and I was doing the BWF primer some time back (3-4 months).

Can someone let me know some kind of detailed plans as to how can I get into the shape of my dreams and achieve my ideal physique.

I can do:
-13 pull ups
- 15  dips with 20kg vest on
- about 25 push ups with 20kg vest on
My program:

PLAN A:

-dips 16kg 10x4 slow
-push ups 12kg 12x4 
-paused dips 8x4
-decline push ups 12x4
-rope pushdown with a band 4x (till failure)

PLAN B:

-pull ups 8x4
-pull up straight grip 12-15x4
-barbell curls 4x12 (2x12 with both hands then rest for 2 min)
-concentration curls with barbells 12x4

I go everything till failiure on the last two sets.
The first advice that I'am looking for is is my workout plan good?
And the second one is more ""wierd"". Like I said I've been training now for a year, I change exercises every 4 weeks to mix it abit. But since I've been training I've been training every day.

"I'm 15 years old, 5'11 and weigh 70kg. I had my weight loss journey a few months ago from 92 kg to 70 kg, but the thing is I didn't do any form of calisthenics at the time.

I started calisthenics a few times here and there did planks, push ups till I had a strain in my back and felt weirs coming back to doing reps again. 

At the moment I do 3 sets of 20 pushups, 15 sit ups and 15 leg raises, and recently I started doing lunges. I do shadow boxing too, why idk I kinda enjoy it. A few weeks ago I stopped doing planks, cause I seem to have lost the enjoyment with it. I'm planning on going on long walks again along with jogs for cardio.

"Hello Everyone,

This is probably a recurrent question here. Sorry for that...

I have been doing the recommended routine for 3months now, and I am almost at the final level of all the progressions. Thank you for the routine; it helps me get back in shape and feel better doing my everyday tasks.

So, I would like to get some suggestions on how to continue progressing. I am already using rings and weights, and I don't mind buying more equipment to do different exercises. My main goal is to increase my core strength and start seeing a better definition of my abs.

For reference, I am doing the recommended routine three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays); on Tuesdays, I am doing 1h15min of HIIT, and on Thursdays, a 15k run. Usually, Saturday and Sunday are rest days, but If I feel like it, I do a 50min body combat on Saturdays.

Thank you in advance for your help and tips.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Here's the bottom line.  2022 is near and let's all get stronger together.

With respect to Pavel Tsatsouline's grease the grove.  Atleast it's from him I first read the idea from.

According to him atleast 15 minutes rest in between sets.  Applying the concept of hiit you can spread the sets throughout the day provided you did the intensity which is 12s from the burpees and then one pull up as icing.

The benchmark to try this is the following

1. Able to do 4 reps of 1 pump burpee 2. 1 negative pull up. 

If you can't, do the walk challenge.  

It is simply do 10 minutes of walking before and after meals.  Meals are breakfast, lunch, dinner.  If you eat more in the day, then pace the walking to at most 1 hour a day.

The burpees as I meant it here is 1 pump. https://youtu.be/CcYzODpXa3w

Do this for 12 seconds as fast as you can in good form.  Upgradeex dissects this wonderfully.  Recommending his burpees form.

Then go straight to do 1-2+ chin up or pull up.  You mustn't go to failure. Leave something in the tank.

Then rest for as long as you need.  But do this 4-8 x within the day.

My suggestion is before and after each meal.  You can spend one minute total doing this or less.  So you end up with 6 sets easy.

For progression.  If you're able to do 12s worth of burpees easily and 1+ chin ups or pull ups for 8 sets spread in the day.  Increase the time frame.

Example.  8 sets today, failure not reached.  Make it 14 seconds. Then 1 plus chin ups.

Keep a journal.  Because it'll allow you to track how many burpees you did in the day and pulls.  So you can get the total at the end of the month.

How about nutrition?

Check your BMI choose the edge between ideal and over weight.  How much grams of protein you need to eat is that number in pounds.  I.e. for me I need to eat 134 grams of protein, which is 80% of the weight in pounds I'm trying to achieve.

How much calories?

You can use any calorie calculator.  But for me I use a simple try and err method based on the idea of my weight in pounds x 15.  Then after a week with my activity, if I increase or decrease weight.  I add or subtract calories.

Caveat.  If you find you feel the performance diminished within the day where you cant do it as intense.  Stop.  Next day awaits.

Also if you can't do a burpee or chinups or pull up.

Go for knee ups, push up, and inverted rows.

Try to do this for atleast 30 days.  But take rest if you feel you should.  And if you can't do it on a certain day because of work etc..it's fine.

But I do hope you take the challenge.  This could be the workout you'll be doing for the rest of your life. Or atleast be a good foundation.

Tldr

Circuit Variation

1 pump burpee and pull up

Squat thrust, push up and inverted row

Body weight squats, push up, inverted row

Knee raises and push ups

Sprints, push ups/dips/pikes, inverted rows/pull ups

Walking

You can also do your own circuit.  But remember, no going to failure.  Spread the sets in the day.  First sign of diminishing performance stop for the day.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I've recently been training weighted pullups, and I'm curious about what I should be doing. With normal pullups, I always start from a dead hang, explode up, hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang, then repeat. Ive had no issues doing them like this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups.

Now for weighted pullups, I want to train these for max strength so sub 5 reps. I was unsure as to how to do the rep. Of course I will start in a dead hang, but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load? Or would I be safer lowering until my arms are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. This is how I currently perform them. Of course I would like to go back into a dead hang and pull from there like I do with unweighted pullups, however my main concern is that over time will this damage my joints or the structures in my shoulders or elbows etc?

Any help/advice regarding this is much appreciated!!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi,

I've been practicing handstands for about a year - 4 days a week. The routine is quite simple - 8 minutes of practicing balance and form using walls and 2 minutes of practicing free-standing handstands. With all that said, I just can't seem to balance it constantly and can do it for 2-3 seconds on average (the strength part of a handstand isn't the problem). I think my form is decent and also, I know how to use my fingers for body repositioning. With heck of a lot videos watched on this subject and much more failed attempts of handstands, I've gotten really frustrated since my progress is non-existent.

So here I am asking you guys for any tip on how to balance a handstand that had helped you in your journey. Thanks in advance :)","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I do three types of workouts: strength, volume and intensity. Strength = very low reps, high rest, volume = medium reps, lots of sets through the day, and intensity = 1-hour HIIT/cardio.

After the first two I get the usual DOMS starting ~24 hours after the workout, which seems absolutely normal.

However, after intensity workouts I am experiencing a very different thing: moderate, but uncomfortable that seems to be located in muscle attachments (e.g. I did arms yesterday, and it is located just over the elbow both for the biceps and triceps, before the main muscle tissue). It begins much earlier (next day), and strengthens significantly when extending the muscle.

I just wanted to understand if that is normal, or if I take it too intensive.

Thank you in advance.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hey folks. I am just starting out in a bodyweight strength routine. My reasons for training are basically down to physical health, aesthetic purposes, and job functionality(want to go into law enforcement and getting into Kajukenbo and BJJ). Not get bulky, but have a lean build with decent strength.

That said, it has taken a while to get a solid routine going. Procrastination aside, part of it is that being autistic it is easy for me to overthink/analyze things. Like, in terms of whether to split muscle groups, full body or push/pull/legs, use weights at the gym or resistance bands. But at this juncture I just want to settle for bodyweight for simplicity, and also Iroh;)

The routine I'll be starting seems to be good for these purposes(may modify exercises/add reps as time goes on) and will do this 3 times a week with days of running inbetween (done in sets of 3, NOT circuit style):

10 Push Ups

12 Deadbugs

15 Squats

10 Doorway Curls

30 Second Plank

10 Narrow Push Ups

"First we saw with Dallas Mccarver, Dave Palumbo and his Rx crew , Jerry Ward and so on going with family history of heart disease causing his death at age 26, and not steriods. Palumbo didn't even mention the 55,000 ng/dl testosterone level.

You have well known bodybuilding channels  arguing against Luke Sandoe's  family post about it being heart disease and that it was definitely suicide. Outrageous. 

Now with Shawn Rhoden, there's this idea being pushed by bodybuilding media that it was the stress of - not- competing and that of the pending rape case that caused him to have a heart attack, and had he only be allowed to compete in the most heart - toxic sport of them all in his mid forties, he'd have been saved.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL7\_6PPvrg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNL7_6PPvrg)

You got Nick Tragilli talking about how careful and conservative Rhoden was with his drug use. As if we all couldnt see how he had shreds approaching that of Andreas Munzer in 2018, and as if he didn't almost bleed to death by a massive overdose of ibuprofen the year prior.

So instead of talking about the safety of athletes, what changes need to be made to prevent these hardworking bodybuilders from dropping like flies, thus saving lives, they're instead talking about what big meanies the IFBB are for not allowing a man with a pending rape case to compete. When the IFBB can do whatever they like with their own company. Rhoden wasn't owed a living by them and yet these commentators are acting like he was entitled to be on stage under the ""innocent until proven guilty"" standard, which they keep repeating - that applies to courts of law, not to businesses. And they know that.

For all their claims of being real and sharing the honest truth in bodybuilding, there's very little honesty here and its all to protect the sports image and the status quo of seeing incredibly big and ripped men and women on stage. So these tragedies will keep repeating.

"I'm trying to get my first proper pull up (never done one). I tried to improve my incline rows (as regression), trained for a month and doubled my max (now 22).  
I noticed while I still can't do a pull up from a dead hang, if my elbows are bent about 30 degrees I can complete the rest of the movement (door pullup bar is low so my feet can touch).

1. continuing with incline rows
2. doing pullup reps starting with my elbows bent about 30 degrees
3. buying some resistance bands and try to lift myself up from a dead hang

"Hi all,

I’ve done BWF in the past, specifically this sub’s RR. I’m a pretty avid cyclist and reasonably healthy but I recently went rock climbing and I was pretty embarrassed at how t-rexed I’ve gotten. 

I move a lot and I’ve always had trouble finding/making a good set of dip and pull up bars. I also find exercises on the floor kind of… gross. Enter: rings. 

I recently got some rings that I’m pretty excited about. I hooked them up to my hammock eye bolts and tried some angled rowing sort of exercises on them, and it felt really good. It really seems like I can do every exercise I need to with these things.

I know rings are generally considered harder than bars since they’re less constrained, but if I start off with angled exercises and supports, could I use my rings from the beginning? 

I kinda want to use them even for planks and push-ups and other ground exercises. Never liked the way the flat angle of ground push-ups puts pressure on my wrist. The ring grip seems much more natural (maybe it reminds me of a handlebar?). Again, if I started with angled ring push-ups or even knee push-ups, does anyone see any problem with this plan?

Essentially, my question is: if I swap in ring exercises everywhere I can in the RR and I like and can perform the workout I come up with, will I miss out on anything or potentially hurt myself?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I’ve been considering switching from traditional weight lifting to calisthenics. I’ve been lifting for about 10 years (27 yo, 6’4, 215) and have kind of fallen in love with the idea of how calisthenics allows you to really take control of your body and movements. 

I’ve done the RR before and didn’t really feel… challenged or like I was progressing I guess is the right word. Push-ups, dips, pull-ups are easy, until you obviously get into your more advanced variations but I didn’t understand how to keep progressing when I couldn’t get certain movements or how to incorporate skills into it. 

Any routines, tips, advice, schedules, professions etc will be helpful. Thank you.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I've been doing ring exercises for a while now. I recently adapted a workout plan I saw on youtube since I kinda did freestyle workouts beforehand. It's been a month since I adapted this new routine:

Sets x Reps

4 x failure | Ring pull-ups

4 x failure | Ring dips

4 x failure | Ring rows

4 x failure | Ring push-ups

4 x failure | Ring T and Ys

4 x failure | Ring bicep curls

4 x failure | Ring tricep extensions


3 minutes rest between each set
If I can't do 4-5 reps before I reach failure, I regress the movement 
(example: ring pull-ups -> band assisted ring pull-ups)

I definitely see improvement size-wise, but I feel like I can't increase my pull-up reps. This isn't the case for the other movements.

I definitely eat enough. I'm not bulking, but I make sure to eat near my maintenance calories and somewhat hit my macros. I'm not a pro and don't plan to be one, so I don't track each gram.

Currently, open rewards graininess and maturity too much over shape and lines, Quinton vs Joel is just a recent example. Because of these criteria, the bodybuilders that are winning are older, less shapely, and not in their prime anymore, by a large margin. For example:

"Hi all.

Been on a fitness journey the last two months and looking for some advice.My main goal at the moment is to lose weight. Currently skinny fat but have lost around 5kg in the past 8 weeks. While doing around 4 sessions of cardio a week and eating at a caloric deficit i have also been incorporating some bodyweightfitness to try and achieve body recomposition. Everyday i do either arms; back or abs (always a rest day after every group)I have a question about my current chest / arm workout. It is as follows:

12 x 3 Push-ups (elbow out)10 x 3 Push-ups (elbows inward)8 x 3 Diamond push-ups8 x 3 Bicep curl14 x 3 Lateral raisesI take a minute of rest between every set, 2 minutes between each exercise, try to focus on form and try to slow down each rep to 4 seconds to increase time under tension. I also go to failure on the last rep of every set for each exercise.

Over the course of the last two months i have made various changes to my workouts after watching calisthenics videos or general fitness videos. I'm wondering whether or not i am doing too many push-up variations in my current workout. My chest does burn like hell after the workout but wondering if i should stick to just one type of push-up and incorporate another exercise instead. If anyone has any thoughts that would be appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi, (14M, ~167cm, 56kg here) everyone
I will get straight to the point:
So, I would like to gain muscle quickly under a month, preferably around 20 pounds or more. 

I am not entirely sure if that's doable especially with bodyweight training. The only thing I have is a resistance band at home that I use for legs and biceps. Another thing you might want to know is about my diet. No, I do not have a planned diet from Dietarize or any other place. But I tend to eat Indian food. Please don't confuse it with fast foods! You might think what I eat is very oily and unhealthy but we use olive oil and not so much. I generally think it is healthy.
I also do not eat junk/fast food very often and when I do it is rarely.

So, back to the point: Is it possible for me to gain _20 lbs or more_ of muscle under a month, with bodyweight and a resistance band? (How can I do so?) And can puberty possibly speed up the process (I have heard you have increased testosterone in puberty and it is basically kinda like you are on steroids.)?

Something you might want to know: I have been training since February and I have seen major improvements to my physique as well as my strength plus mobility. So, I believe I already got my newbie gains...??

Sorry if this is a bad question but I would just like to gain weight quickly in the winter break as I do not want to be skinny-muscle, if you know what I mean.

Thanks a lot and please feel free to ask any question!

"Hey guys - I need some advice.   


I'm trying to work on building a functional and broad base of fitness. I've started running every day, but only about 2.5km for the first two weeks and will likely add 500m per fortnight until I reach around 6-7km a day. Along side this however, I'm finding that I finish my run in a park and I still have a bit of time and energy to fit in some resistance training. So;

I want to know if there is some sort of basic full body workout routine that I could repeat, perhaps Monday-Friday mornings after my run, that would give me a basic level of strength. At the moment i'm doing: 

1. Super set of pushups, Australian pullups, and squats - 3x set to 80% capacity (perhaps 12-15 reps each).
2. Super set of chin ups, hanging oblique raises, single leg kickbacks and incline tricep pushup - 2x sets at 70% capacity (perhaps 3-6 chin ups, 5 oblique raises and 10 kickbacks each side).
3. 2-3 minutes of core - V sits, hollow body holds, crunches etc.

I would really love some advice on things i could change or perhaps add to get a more rounded training program. Ideally I'd love to do the same or a similar workout every day along with a run. I travel a lot, and have a pretty varied schedule so I would love something I could just get up in the morning and smash out before my day starts.

I appreciate any advice that anyone can throw my way, or even if anyone could point me in the right direction on where to read more about this.

"Hi all, a while back I posted about a study we were doing investigating SARMs since there is little to no data on the effects, both positive and negative, on SARMs usage. Well, with your help, we were able to gather some interesting data from SARMs users. Below is a link to the actual paper, but I have also summarized some of the points.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-021-00465-0.pdf?origin=ppub](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-021-00465-0.pdf?origin=ppub)

General points:

\-More than 90% of users acquired SARMs from the internet without consulting a doctor before they started using them

\-More than 50% of users experienced side effects like mood swings, decreased testicular size and acne

\-90% of men reported increased muscle mass and were satisfied with their SARMs usage

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Despite having seemingly positive effects, more than 50% of SARMs users report significant adverse effects. Because of these reported adverse effects including decreased testicular size there may be concern that usage can effect male fertility.

For example, in Steven Low's book ""Overcoming gravity"", it is stated: ""The simplest method to maintain shoulder structural balance involves utilizing pull and push exercises, which will offset one another. This will allow you to maintain a healthy balance of strength and hypertrophy at the shoulder"".

But what are exactly the consequences of an imbalance, especially doing almost only pushing? Can it be a real issue or is it just a matter of preferences? Or maybe, this push/pull method is too simple and reality is more complex?

I think it is a common imbalance as pushing exercises are easier to put in place: they require no bars or equipment. It can be trained with the floor only.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I love doing single leg loaded squats on some sort of platform(so not exactly a pistol). It's currently my primary leg exercise, as gyms are closed here, and I can't powerlift.

Problem is, my left leg is super weak at balancing, so once I start loading close to my 1RM, I have a hard time keeping balance.

Another example, are single legged deadlifts. I can easily do them continuously on my right leg, but the left one struggles, and I have to readjust or rebalance with every rep. Most reps I can't even finish.

Interestingly, my left hip is far more flexible, when it comes to stretches like the figure four yoga position. My left hamstring is also more flexible. 

How can I develop this balancing strength in a single leg?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I searched the sub for any similar questions but couldn't find anything except possibly [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/r9yv5v/looking_for_workout_and_nutrition_tips_post_covid/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but my situation is different so I'm posting here. 

30F, 65KG, 172cm. I've been training a u/L split of the RR, pre-covid I was at 4x5 pull-ups, 4x5 p-bar dips, 3x10 decline parellette push-ups, 3x8 ring arc rows, 4x6 full pistols, 4x6 nordic eccentrics. I was working on grip strength and climbing 3-4x a month, cycling and doing yoga. 

For context, one of my friends has had long covid for the last 18 months. She was the one who got me into climbing, was quite fit and is just now slowly getting back to pre-covid levels due to the severe fatigue she experienced. I've looked into this and come across articles such as this from the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/well/move/exercise-covid-recovery-complications-clots-heart-lungs.html) and [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/if-youve-just-had-covid-exercise-might-not-be-good-for-you/) setting out the significant health risks of returning to exercise too quickly.  

Its been a month since I got covid, I was quite ill for two weeks and have had ongoing breathing issues, tiredness for the last two weeks. I've also had an inflammation in my foot (unrelated as its plantar fasciitis which I have not had before, but apparently exacerbated by covid) limiting my mobility but am working with a physio on this. I've been doing breathwork where possible and trying to walk as much as I can. I tried to do a light version of the RR the other day but just the warm-up left me really exhausted... 

Has anyone experienced anything similar post covid? Any advice on how to safely return to exercise and gradually build up to the same level as before? I'm concerned about over-stressing my system and developing long covid so any advice greatly appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I’m a 14 year old female, 165cm tall and I weigh around 60kg. I have never worked out my arms, even though I dabbled with cardio for a while and I felt motivated to start. I quickly realized that I can’t do one push-up, which wasn’t a big deal at first since this was expected. Though I can barley do one knee push-up either (which I had before), I’ve been working out with a focus on my arms for about two weeks now and I see no results. When I searched for advice, there were only answers from dudes, and they basically said to do just push-ups? 

My current workout is:
-5-10chair dips (though I experience quite a bit of pain in my shoulders)
-30sec to 1min hunters pose
-10 squats
-30 incline push-ups against a kitchen counter
-15-20 seconds push-up position
-5 half-push-ups
-10 half knee push-ups
-30 sec plank
-3 leg lifts
-10 sit-ups
And I repeat this most often twice, but sometimes three times. I work out every other day, sometimes two days in a row.
I finish it off with 15 minutes on a stationary bike, with the last 5 going all in.

"Its been a while since I posted in this subreddit. But over the last,4-6 months I’ve been recovering from an injury I sustained whilst playing football. After loads of rehab I’m back to being able to play competitively, although I’m probably at 70% match fitness. In the time I did not Calisthenics or any sort of resistance training. Now, since getting back to it and I’ve been doing the RR (Recommended Routine) for about 6 weeks, and I’ve progressed pretty quickly and I’m back to doing weighed pull ups and weighted dips. 

Over the time I was not training, I looked over my previous training and thought I’d change it up so I can learn to FL and Planche in 2022 - or at least get the FL by this time next year. I know the Planche is quite hard, so that may take 2 years at bare minimum. So I’m seeking some advice on programming and routine structure. I know Steve is planning to release an app sometime soon, but in the meantime I need some advice. My plan is to train towards my Calisthenic goals about 3x a week, with 1 or sessions of legs per week (depending on football ⚽️ training). So here is an outline of my plan after I do another two weeks of the RR.

Monday & Friday 

1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) 
2. FL and Planche Statics 
3. FL Rows + PPPUs
4. Pull Ups + Pike Push Ups

Wednesday:

1. Warm up and Mobility (15 mins) 
2. FL and Planche Statics 
3. FL Raises + Tuck L-sit to Tuck Planche 
4. Bicep Isolation  + Shoulder/Tricep Isolation

One idea is too alternate each week which workout I do once or twice in that week.In the example above, I do Wednesdays workout on Monday & Friday and take the former and do it on Wednesday. Changing it each week 

An alternative routine would be to have a Planche and FL day. 

Monday and Thursday:

1. Tuck Planche Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. Planche Lean (15 seconds) X4
3. Tuck L-Sit To Tuck Planche (5) X5
4. PPPUs (5) X5
5. Pike Push ups (6-10) X5

Tuesday and Friday: 

1. Tuck Front Lever Hold (5-10 seconds) X4 2. 2. Tuck Front Lever Raises (2-4) X4
3. FL Rows (1) X7
4. Pull Ups (5-8) X4
5. Hollow Body Hold (30sec) X4 and/or bicep isolation

Another alternative, instead of doing legs on a sperate days, is to throw in a maximum of 2 leg exercises at the end of each workout similar to how the RR has squats and RDLs. That way I can work on my Planche and FL training, whilst still making leg gains and leaving the other days to do more drill/technique based training for my soccer or focussing on improving my mobility (such as ankle mobility) which is terrible.

"I bought a pair of rings during summer and have been using it outside for the time being. But now that it's winter and we're in a lockdown. I wanted to try and hang my rings in my basement.


I have these ceiling joists exposed but wasn't too sure what tools would need to be used and how they would be used to hang them.

From my research, people say to run a bolt horizontally through the joists and then attach a carabiner which would hold the rings. I wasn't too sure if thats the best most secure way to do this. If it is, what type of bolts would I need to purchase?

&#x200B;

This is my first real post so, it might be too long and it might not make as much sense. 

I would like to share as much as possible of my experience. I hope this will help people that were where I was some months ago.

Today, I unlocked the full back lever (both grips) with 0 specific training, apart from a sporadic attempt from time to time.

I also unlocked a pretty clean straddle front lever but I will talk about that when I will get the full one.

I know the hold time are shorts, but the attempts happened after my weighted chin ups sets. I am pretty sure I can get a clean 5s+ or even 7s+ when rested.

&#x200B;

**What was my training like?**

I just focused on improving

\- weighted ring pull ups (current best: 30 kgs x 6)

\- weighted ring dips (full rom) (current best: 25 kg x 8)

&#x200B;

**How often did I train?**

\- I pretty much trained 1 per week or sometimes 2 times, 3 sets of each, trying to do more than the last time, RPE 10, 0 RIR and so on, sets of 3-6 reps of a given weight -> this has most of the time led to tendinitis and frequent need to deload

\- Nowadays I train 2 times per week with more reps in reserve and more volume, same movement patterns

&#x200B;

I do track my calories and got my nutrition and sleep (most of the time) on point.

&#x200B;

**Here are my current stats**

Male

Been seriously training for almost 1 year (first 2-3 months - gym as a result of the New Year Resolution, 1 month off, after that switched to basic calisthenics (due to lockdown) for 3 to 4 months, pretty sporadic, full of tendinitis and no plan at all, and, since then, weighted calisthenics with clear goals and structure in mind)

Before that I had one year in which I lost some weight (from 90 kgs) - first lockdowns for a time reference - playing basketball and I also did sporadic bodyweight training, 1 or 2 a week, random, no plan, trying to get my first pull up which ended up in me doing sets of 10 pretty quick. I was also able to do 20 dips at the end of this period (not the best form). 

Age: 17, almost 18

Height: a little bit over 190 cm (6 ft 3)

Weight: 79-81 KGs (175 lbs) - pretty low bodyfat, meaning that I have visible veins on my abs and on my legs

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am quite tall, long legs, and now, not the lightest. I am saying this as a way to highlight that I am not the best suited for statics, yet, I unlocked the backlever fairly easy.

To be realistic, I was always quite strong and have a tendency to gain mass and strength easy. For example, my first squat back to the gym days was 100 kgs x 1, first deadlift 120 kgs x 1 and the numbers always end up quickly, as my deadlift at the end of those 2 months was about 160 kgs - not tested but calculated (conventional) and 140 kgs - tested (sumo) and so on.

But, given the fact that I do not have the best leverages for statics,  I think that getting strong with the basics will unlock statics as a byproduct (at least front lever and back lever). 

It might not be as direct as specific work, but it clearly includes more benefits than specific work only.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"[Eagle loops](https://imgur.com/5DODID4)

Hi guys, so, in a typical day I walk past my pull up bar and do a few dead hangs. (Hoping to loosen tight lats). I heard about these loops and thought it would help strengthen my fingers? Perhaps have some carryover into climbing, maybe even some weird kind of conditioning?

Figured why not add the Eagle loops whilst hanging as a 2 in 1. 

Sounds like a good idea. What should I expect strength wise or carryover wise?

E.g, for my lat stretching, I'm walking past and doing a 1 minute (ish) dead hang, adding the straps whilst doing that would enable me to hang AND get some kind of finger conditioning.

Could I replace regular lunges with fencing lunges in my workout?

Would fencing lunges work the same things as regular lunges? I'm not thinking of performing the fencing lunges explosively like in actual fencing, instead I would perform them at the same pace as regular lunges.

I'm not even a fencer, this lunge just comes more naturally to me. My goal is strength and hypertrophy.

I don't know If it's possible to link videos, so just look it up how to do a fencing lunge.

"I want to change.

For context: 

Hello. I am a seventeen year old female high school student who has been overweight my entire life. I currently live in the normal suburban town area in the United States with my family including my mother, father, respected grandmothers, and brother. Becoming healthier has always been a want in my life. I want to attend the gym. I want to diet. I want to do what is best for my body. But in the current circumstances I’m in, everything just seems so unpromising and difficult to follow through with. I really don’t know what to do. 

Living with my family means adjusting to the diet plan of the house. My whole family is overweight, and do not seem to desire change in their lifestyles. The pantry is full of cookies and chips galore, healthy alternatives such as fruits and vegetables can rarely be seen, and the common dinner meal is usually a greasy, high calorie, take out dish, as everyone is too lazy to cook a decent home cooked meal. Although I want to provide the things to better my diet myself, the nearest grocery market is about an hour walk both ways, making it impossible for me to carry everything I buy back home. It doesn’t help that a huge snow storm came by making the roads and pavement walks icy. I don’t have a car or any other form of transportation to get me anywhere either. I would also like to attend a gym so I can get myself engaged in a motivational environment with people that obtain the same goal as me, to become healthier. However, the closest gym to my house is about a two hour walk one way. Especially with it being junior year, trying to balance school on top of that would be difficult and I would end up walking home alone in the evenings, which is quite scary to me. 

I try to do at home workouts, but I constantly face judgement from my family members. They laugh and make fun of me for dieting, and often approach me with a snarky tone for trying. I have lost the confidence to try anything in front of family, and just pray to get accepted into my dream university in an urban area where everything I wish to utilize can be easily accessible/obtainable for me.

"I see a lot of posts here talking about workouts.  My belief is that  workouts should really be your own, so you need to understand your body and work towards your goals.

 I workout on rings  roughly 4 times a week, aside from a complicated shoulder dislocation about 6 months ago, i  have done this for about 2 years. 

My workouts are flexible, paying attention to how my body feels to avoid injury and also keeping my goals in my mind. My goals are never on body appearance, but focus on calisthenics skills.

For these reasons I have a fluid workout program, which has the added important benefit of preventing boredom from repeating the same exercises over and over again. 

This workout  https://youtu.be/7SD041rb8Jg
 travels through foundational exercises such as the back lever, pelican curls and muscle up variations as we learn and condition towards the backwards roll or felge.  

The static exercises of the back lever and front lever straddle are advanced to a dynamic transition and the muscle up is upgraded to a forward felge or rolling muscle up.

(Sorry for the wall of text, I am a little afraid of violating rule 3)

After 2/3 months of practise I finally managed to ""really"" hold my first unsupported handstand! I actually felt like holding it, not just letting momentum keep me in balance for 1-2 seconds. Also, I am starting to feel my core, my glutes, my fingers and my arms contributing to the handstand. I feel a lot more controlled and my banana arch is going away. I am aware It's not much, but it's progress, and I wanted to share my little successes with the community!

90% of my training is on rings, and I already had the strength to hold a handstand before actually starting to specifically train it, so my focus was on the balance.

**Specifically,** I started with back-to-wall handstands without much progress. Once I learned how to safely get into and out of **stomach-to-wall** **handstands**, I started doing those and seeing my progress skyrocket. For me, it was very difficult to focus on so many different things at the same time: using my hands to keep myself from falling forwards, slightly bending my arms when falling backwards to get back into position, keeping my shoulders elevated, holding my core and glutes, trying to avoid the infamous banana back. Once these basics started becoming automatic, I could focus more and more on actually keeping the balance. Since balance was my issue, the important thing was getting as much balance-time as possible while training. Stomach to wall handstands really helped me with that, because they allowed me to spend most of my time actually feeling the balance rather than falling and getting back into position all the time.

Also an underrated exercise that I did a few times is the **forearm stand**. It helped me focus on my core and glutes.

Finally, it was immensely helpful to meet people and ask them to critique and correct me. We can only feel so much on our own, and video recordings help up to a certain point. Having other people give you live feedback and helping them in return is a great way to improve our own form, to learn to analyse someone else's form and notice details we would otherwise ignore, and to form bonds with other fellow athletes. This, I feel, is a really big point that many people gloss over in Calisthenics. The community, at least to me, is extremely important. When I train by myself, I put my headphones in and I am isolated, I focus on myself and on my movements, but I don't have that constant feedback I would when training with others. Also, I am in my own ""bubble"", doing my exercises my way, not seeing another person's way of training and their points of view. So if you usually train alone, maybe try to step out of your comfort zone a little and chat with that other person who is also doing cali near you whom you have been awkwardly avoiding for the past 30 minutes. Compare notes, exchange productive info (avoid getting distracted and wasting training time chatting about nonsense!)... It might help you both. Or not, and that's okay too, everyone has their own thing!

"**INTRODUCTION**

 I started 'lifting' way back in 2001. Back when information was less readily available so we had to rely on magazines of Flex and Men's Health.

Bodybuilding splits and anabolic windows were the order of the day however less information meant less time for overthinking and more time for throwing yourself into training.

Newbie gains were experienced and the idea that 'lifting' was for life was fully embraced.

This however led to dogmatic thinking and doubling down on my beliefs which meant that most other training modalities were brushed off or even worse, ignored.

Father time and maturity started seeping in which led to me questioning my training beliefs over time, desperate to find a style of training that would take me back to when my training was in it's infancy.

The ever increasing amount of information available was also causing training anxiety, reinforcing the idea that something better was out there and I wasn't doing it!

This led to program hopping and paralysis by analysis.

In 2019, my daughter was born. As any new dad can testify, this was a game changer in the old training regime however I was obsessed with the gym. 

Training was intrinsic with my identity. I devised a training regime that meant I was attending the gym at 4.30am, 6 times a week. I also started doing a John Meadows program called Gamma Bomb while on a 'cut' in the hope that I would finally achieve the physique of my dreams.

I started dropping weight. Everything was going well then one day I looked in the mirror....

I hadn't put on as much muscle as I thought I had.

In fact, I would wager that I looked awful, if you considered that I had been training consistently for TWENTY ODD YEARS.

All those years thinking I was laying down new tissue and creating 'slabs' of muscle.

When really, it was mostly bodyfat.

Grams of muscle and pounds of fat.

I'm convinced that FLEX Magazine had told me the opposite would happen!

**ENTER THE BURPEE**

This was a wake up call. I knew I was at a stage where I couldn't waste time. I was now in my 40s so any muscle building potential was diminishing. 

I also had my fitness to think about and staying alive in order to remain a presence in the life of my children for as long as possible.

I discovered the work of /u/mythicalstrength and noticed that he was including burpees in his workouts.

Burpees???

I was told that burpees were ‘pointless’ and only used as a ‘punishment exercise, usually by fitness instructors who wanted people to walk out their class feeling like they had been worked hard.

Thing is that I started doing them anyway and kinda enjoyed them.

**ENTER THE IRON WOLF**

My burgeoning interest in conditioning and burpees led me down a YouTube rabbit hole. That’s when I came across The Iron Wolf.

I was repping out 50 burpees 3 times a week so you can only imagine the massive red pill that I swallowed when I seen this guy repping out 1000.

I was hooked and I wanted a slice of this burpee fuelled pie.

I started watching his videos all days. I was in about them like a dog eating french fries.

Over the course of the next few weeks, ‘lifting’ started taking a back seat as I started throwing myself into the wolf’s routines.

Chin ups, dips, push ups, burpees all day, every day.

No time for ‘recovery’. This style of training could be done every day.

Why?

It was FUN, EXCITING AND DYNAMIC and it took me back to that kid who was knee deep in FLEX mags and throwing himself with aplomb in his local council gym.

The training fire was back.

High rep bodyweight circuits where I would consume insane amounts of volume was finally giving me the results I craved!

100 chin ups a day.
100+ burpees a day.
Air squats whenever I had the time.

I was training like a prisoner in a cell with nothing to lose.

Recovery was an afterthought because I felt ready to go every day.

Since then I have trained this way exclusively. I have kept away from the barbell and embraced bodyweight training to be the sole focus of my training time.

My training has lacked structure due to family duties however this has actually been a bonus because the random nature and not knowing what I’m doing until five minutes before the workout has been fun! 

Over the last few months I have set milestones in my bodyweight journey.

**MILESTONE 1**

300 Burpees - https://youtu.be/ub4eimfjawM

I did this workout on a whim. I had an itch to do high rep burpees and decided that 300 would be manageable.

My pacing was off and i felt like I had been rag dolled however the post workout feeling was one of elation and I knew that I was going somewhere with this training style.

**MILESTONE 2**

500 Burpees - https://youtu.be/B4oaMnEfAb8

This was when the doors of potential opened up to me.

Once again, I had yet to master a good pace however I knew that If I could bag 500 burpees then I could really go to town on the high reps.

**MILESTONE 3**

1000 Burpees - https://youtu.be/xu1SbTV1guc

This wasn’t as challenging as the 500, mainly because my pace had been tweaked however my fitness had increased exponentially and my confidence in my ability was stronger.

**MILESTONE 4**

500 Navy Seals - https://youtu.be/KstCoAsVlTQ

This was my most recent and was something that had eluded me for quite a while, mainly because navy seals are absolutely brutal. Probably the most painful exercise out there in my opinion.

What got me through it was a good pace and manageable volume. This was a big lesson I learned from the Iron Wolf. Managing volume by making the reps short but the rounds long, sometimes super long.

**RESULTS**

The most profound result for me was the one that had mattered most during my 20 years of fruitless training.

My physique - https://i.imgur.com/qZrOY2L.jpg

It had transformed before my very eyes.

Years of 'optimal training' and countless diet protocols.

Completely blown out the water by one of the most basic forms of training available to anyone, anywhere.

My fitness levels have been taken to unseen levels.

I can rep out 100 burpees in 4.46.

I can rep out 100 chin ups in about 13 minutes.

I just feel better overall. I move better and have way more energy. I also feel stronger. I put  this to the test recently by attempting some reps on the bench press. I managed 3 reps with 225lbs having not tried this lift in under a year. I had to go on a few 5/3/1 cycles to even get near those numbers when I was exclusively 'lifting'.

The massive pushing volume in the burpees had increased my strength.

**MESSAGE**

I implore everyone to try this training style. It had the most profound effect on me both mentally and physically.

It also helped my wallet as I didn't need access to a gym anymore

Please don't do what I did. Bog yourself down in the dogmatic thinking that 'lifting' is the only answer. I left years of gains on the table following this mentality.

Bodyweight training is natural and so rewarding. It is the essence of true strength. Mastering your body and movement. Not being 'gym strong'. Being 'real world strong'

"Hi everyone I'm a newbie to the group. Little about me. Im 29. Ive never had to exercise to not gain weight, and as such uve never really exercised. Besides hiking in the woods or skateboarding. All I'm really looking to accomplish is to stay as lean as possible while also being in good shape. I know its not a real person but this is the body I'm hoping to achieve  https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God . So any tips would be greatly appreciated.

"Hey all, so I've been doing the RR and variations of it for a few months now, with reasonable success. However, I'm still pretty behind on my push-up capacity.

For example, I'm at nearly-horizontal rows for inverted rows and can easily do much more than my initial limit, and I've definitely progressed on exercises like deadbugs and ring ab rollouts/planks. But for push-ups, I'm still at incline push-ups, I've barely even managed to lower the incline, and I can still only barely manage the amount that I started at, 3x8 reps... my arms just begin to give out.

What can I do to improve/increase my push-up capacity? Are there any exercises, stretches, etc. that I can do at home? (Right now I have access to a gym -- and I try to do a bench-press, squats, barbell rows, and deadlifts there at least 2-3 times a week -- but gyms are closing and I'm not sure how safe it'll be to go for the next month, so I'm preparing to do as much of the RR as I can at home.)

Thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"

"So, as background, my workout routine is basically the same as RR, but I added three sets of chin-ups and headstand push-ups rather than replacing pull-ups and ring push-ups because I didn't want to neglect any muscle groups. This has worked pretty well for me, since the added chin-ups have done a lot to improve my pull-ups while improving my biceps a bit more than pull-ups by themselves.

Now, I'm close to doing 8 pull/chin-ups, and I'm thinking about how I'm going to do typewriters with my current set-up. I use rings and a door frame pull-up bar, which is great so far, but doesn't really give me enough room to do typewriters (I've tried, and while I can kind of move to the side either way, I definitely can't straighten my arm).

That said, ring typewriters might be possible, but not side to side. Would moving one arm forward, rather than to the side, provide the same benefits as standard ring typewriters? I can pull my legs up enough to provide enough strap length for the motion, I just don't know if it counts as a ""real"" typewriter pull-up, since I'm moving my assisting arm in a totally different direction.

And yes, I know, I could do weighted pull-ups instead, or else go to a playground or something, but the former doesn't work for me because budget, while the latter doesn't work for me right now because acute neuropathy makes my hands super sensitive to the Winter cold (and I also like to spread my workout throughout the morning so I can do work at the same time, so making 6 trips to the local playground would defeat the purpose of that when I can otherwise walk 1 foot to my closet).","bodybuilding, fitness"

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/muscle-pain-it-may-actually-be-your-fascia

Cited a reference for the source and my solution is stretching in addition to your exercise routine.

Here's the routine

1. Do your breath work, for me that's 8 breathes of wimhof.

2. Isometric warm up the muscle area. Like do static squats or push up or chin up.  (Ive always done stretching after exercise as cool down)

3. Then do the stretch and hold it for atleast 20 seconds.  You can work you way by progression by adding seconds to hold x position till 1-2 minutes.

Question can you stretch everyday?

Yes.  Just make sure to warm up the muscle. So you don't injure yourself.

Is bouncing ok?

No.  Because if you're not yet flexible, doing so may lessen your flexibility or injure yourself.

Is dynamic stretching ok?

Yes. But it's not what I promote because if you're new to stretching, you may hurt yourself.

Sample routine I do.

1. Wake up
2. Do the day's exercise (deload or workout)
3. Wimhof breaths 8 reps per stretch.
4. Cold shower
5. Breakfast work etc.

https://www.healthline.com/health/full-body-stretch

Reference for basic routine

Tldr.  Stretch after your work out.  You can stretch everyday.  Stretching is good for you.

"20 F, hello! i currently am in a little bit of a pickle. recently i have been prescribed adhd meds that have really been helping me daily with working and school and helping me stay on top of all the things i couldn’t take any control over because of my silly brain. unfortunately, this has caused me to lose some weight due to lack of appetite. at first i wasn’t complaining haha, my last medication cause me to binge eat and had me gain some weight and when i was losing that gained weight i felt like i was going back to my normal set weight, until yesterday i dropped lower than my normal weight. i was wrong to assume my weight would plateau out once it hit my usual weight which is around 130, (i am 5’5). yesterday i was 129.02 and today i am 128.02. i’ve been checking it often so i can make sure it wouldn’t drop below. I told my psychiatrist about this and she mentioned going back down to a lower dose but i’m already at such a low dose, and the previous dose  wasn’t helping as nearly as much as i wanted. i know muscle weighs more than fat, and idk if my goal would even be possible or makes sense. i just want a way to get at a higher weight without losing a lot of fat and looking too skinny. idk if i should change my diet, i don’t really eat super healthy to begin, and now im eating less because no appetite. i try to force myself to eat but it does become uncomfortable at times. i want to know if there’s excursuses i can do that can help me gain muscle mass, or if there’s things to eat that’ll help me in that direction as well. i have an appointment once a month and i just had my last one a few days ago. i want to be able to hopefully gain a few pounds before my next appointment, i’m just not wanting to do it in an unhealthy way with fatty foods. if there’s any way to go about doing this i’ll accept any tips. thank you !

edit: actually i decided i am more worried about the number than looks, so if anything makes me look visually more skinny it doesn’t really matter i just don’t want my weight going below 130 lbs. i am slim to begin with so i don’t think there would be much of a visual difference to begin","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello :D

I train boxing around 3 days a week.

On top of that, 2-3 days a week I do additional strength training at home.

My body type currently is skinny fat.

&#x200B;

My goals are:

1. increase my overall strength, especially for boxing purposes
2. get a nice body

&#x200B;

My strength training routine is very simple:

1. Push-ups. I do push-ups progressions, once I hit 12 pushups in a single set, I increase the difficulty.

I do all my sets until the failure, and I do about 9-10 sets per training day. Not in a single training session, but just through the whole day.

2. jumping squats. Meaning that I squat down and then jump into the air. Once I build more core muscles, I want to add raising the legs upwards, close to the chest, while jumping.

Currently, I do about 40-60 of these in 3-4 sets.

3. four core exercises:

a) crunches

b) heel taps

c) while lying, horizontal scissors (with legs)

d) while lying, moving both of my legs up and down at the same time.

I do 2 sets, 35 reps of each exercise in a single set.

&#x200B;

About once a week I also do plank tap (2 sets of 10 reps)

When I'll lose some weight, I'm going to add pull-ups to my routine.

&#x200B;

So, how does this routine sound to you?

I don't really want to increase the time I spend on the strength training too much, however, I could add 1 or 2 more exercises if that would be significantly beneficial. I'm also not sure if my selection of core exercises is good, especially the c) and d).

Any suggestions?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello, 

Just joined this community, and started the RR a couple of weeks ago! 

I am 5'8, 190 lbs (\~86kg) --> when I was lighter, I was easily able to do pushups and some pull-ups, but obvioiusly that isn't the case now. Even though I'm overweight, I'm having a good time and progressing decently well! 

This is a total beginner question, but I haven't had any luck in seeing it answered. 

I know that if you weigh more, calisthenics is tougher, especially the deeper you go, and your progress will be slower. While I'm totally fine with that - woudn't me being a heavier weight be..helpful? Now I know that's a dumb question but I'm not sure why that isn't the case. Wouldn't I get stronger if I start doing pullups at 185-190 lbs vs 150-155 lbs? I know that isn't correct, but would love it if someone could help me out.

"I would love some input:

""Intense Exercise including resistance exercise, weights, HIIT, calisthenics, and cardio could be the best holistic health practice ever,  by a wide margin.  Unfortunately too many people don't do the **intensity** part.  Most people can build a lot of health strength this way.  Intense exercise is actually more efficient  at triggering autophagy and apoptosis than fasting.

""There is definitely a ""too little"" and a ""too much"" when it comes  to intense exercise.  See the section about Hormesis.  Build gradually,  but don't be afraid of a little pain,  especially sore muscles.  Build your determination so that you  celebrate when you get to an authentic **failure**, when you simply  can't push or pull any longer.  Sometimes when I ""fail"" doing push-ups, my arms are so tired and so weak that I have to  roll over on my side and use my elbows to get up, while chuckling to  myself at what a victory that was.  Don't shy away from very long rest periods during the day.  The point of HIIT  (**H**igh **I**ntensity **I**nterval **T**raining, the best  way to exercise) is that you can put everything into your exercise.  Easy cardio is better than nothing,  but it does not qualify as intense exercise.  Intensity is the secret.  Intense exercise is insanely good for one's willpower, about on par with cold showers. 	   [ Dr. Peter Attia, MD on Joe Rogan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92kYDVjX0G0)  Peter tells us in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best  'drug' for health and longevity. 	   	

""I actually spend very little time exercising.  I would guess  that perhaps 20 minutes per day, scattered all across the day.  But  those 20 minutes are down right heroic, like 100 push-ups in less than 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I  am resting.  Without adequate recovery, lots of people fail to progress.   I can't tell you how many young people I've seen on YouTube who complain that they aren't getting the  gains that they were hoping for, when they do 100 push-ups (or more)  every day.  They aren't giving themselves time to recover.  If your muscles still hurt, then rest.   This isn't rocket science.  It **IS** being excessively yang,  pushing one's self too hard and not allowing for recovery, which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process.   No one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after  day.  Every other day is quite  sufficient.

Right now I am a beginner in Handstands (just hit my first 10s hold, and can hit my kickup balance point about 20% of the time for 2-5s ""holds""), although I have been training strength and calisthenics in general for over a year (1-Leg front lever, tuck planche, LSit on floor, weighted pulling, one arm pushup etc)

- Tuck jump up to tuck handstand
- Freestanding HSPU
- Frogstand to Handstand
- LSit to Handstand

My questions are about how to organize the learning of these skills/strength moves:

- Is there things I can be working simultaneously, or is there an order you suggest to learn these skills serially?

"I have been training to achieve a muscle up, I have not yet achieved it and thought perhaps I could ask some guidance?

This is what my workout typically looks like:

Day 1:
Max pull ups - I started by trying to get 20 in as few sets as possible but once I reached 10 I increased this to 30 - max 11 consecutively
Max straight bar dips - same as above - max 10
30 minute run
L-sit progressions - 3 sets of Tuck L-sit holds with the aim of 30+ seconds each set, my best set was 31s, 22s, 14s
Touchdown squats - building up to pistol squats but not my focus just yet.

With the research I have conducted I realise a couple of points which I have not incorporated because I just don’t know how to properly.

1. I would be better off to focus on more explosive pull ups for fewer reps - would it be effective for me to work plyometric pull ups so I know it is explosive?
2. The muscle up pattern/technique curves around the bar and is not just a straight pull

Whenever I have tried to swing forward I attempt to pull upon the backward swing but I don’t seem to be able to pull in enough and it just becomes a sloppy looking pull up - I am thinking that if I add headbangers in I might get past this issue.

I am considering training more towards the one arm pull up. I know it is a movement which demands more strength to perform but I figure that if I can build up the strength necessary for that I would by effect enable me to learn the muscle up easier.

What would anyone recommend, keep doing what I’m doing, add/remove something, focus on one arm pull ups or alternate between them?","bodybuilding, fitness"

I played basketball for six years seriously but when I was 17 years old I had to quit for some reasons. After my basketball career I had an opportunity to become a fighter (I always wanted this but never had a chance) and I joined to a Muay Thai club. I trained myself for years how to land basic strikes correctly (and I got in some street fights unfortunately and I practiced what I know) so I was not afraid of how to learn those moves but my fear was my conditioning. I completed my first session and I did it without extra breaks, my cardio was on point (thanks to basketball) With coronavirus my fighting journey was sadly over. I never did cardio, I stopped every cardiovascular activity because of lockdown, I did only bodyweight workouts at home in straight sets because I was already doing basic calisthenics for 4-5 years like that. From the first lockdown to this day here's what happend:

•Gained extra fat but still have muscles

•My cardiovascular performance is trash

•I'm not fast and explosive like in the past

•Lost flexibility

Okay so I'm turning 19 years old on January, my height is 1.90cm and my weight is 95kg or something close. I don't have any options for cardio (even running outside) I'm planning to do a fullbody circuit workout for cardio, for example;

4) Jumping Lunges    5) Flutter Kicks    6) Burpees

The other day I'm gonna do a straight sets pull workout because I'm not strong at pull ups like push moves.

I know I can't run 5km with this type of training but I wanna get close to my old cardio performance and support burning some extra fat. So what you guys recommend to me?

- PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:

Last time I asked for help with the routine, people told me to add to it. Now, at the end of my workouts I am often unable to even one more rep, but I'd like to try to add to it anyway.

I'd like to add one more type of exercise to my workouts on PUSH and PULL day. However, in the 8-12*5 format I think I would be too tired to perform optimally across all of those sets. 

Is it feasible for me to do 8-12* 4 for 3 exercises, rather than 5* 8 for two exercises?

IF it is viable to do that, then WHAT should my next exercise be? 

On PUSH day, I was thinking of buying a bench to bench press on. It's easy to progressively overload, and I've heard you can build good size with it. If that is a good idea, I still need to budget for one first, so what could I do in the meantime? 

On PULL day, I don't have a clue what to add. All recommendations welcome.

on LEGS/ARMS day I'm okay leaving it as it is - my legs look fine and BSS into Nordic curls are absolutely enough for me. I fucking hate working legs so if I add more to it I don't think I'd ever work legs again! 

As I said earlier, I'd like to find a short (7-15 minutes) ab workout where I can track progressive overload. 

Thanks! All advice very much appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Heya,

I'm a 17 year old girl, and I do circus stuff. I'm aiming to be able to do 10 consecutive pullups within the next 10 months.

I have a pullup bar in a doorframe in my house, but just training pullups doesn't seem to help me at all, even if I do them every day they don't seem to get any easier, and I'm stuck at around 3 or 4 consecutive.

Any advice on exercises that could help me build strength for more pullups would be much appreciated!

Also I have a much easier time doing the first half of the pullup than the last half. Getting my arms to a right-angle is easy, but then past that and especially pulling my chest to the bar is incredibly difficult.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"17M, in college and upcoming quarter because I am getting into in person learning so I’ll have access to a full gym since in person. Been doing the following for the past 6 months

* 50 PPUs
* 30 minutes of jump rope (past 2 months)
* 25 pull ups
* 25 chin ups I worked out 5 days a week at home

Obviously I’ve been focusing too much on my upper body since I’ve been stuck at home doing hybrid.

Any routine suggestions for cutting? I am already average weight for my height and I wanna cut more and define my abs further, and obviously do leg day. My routine I’ve came up with is

* 25 pull ups
* 25 chin ups
* leg raises on pull up bar
* squats (5x3)
* 30 minutes on stair master
* 30 minute jog
* front lever (still learning this)

I’ve signed up for kickboxing aerobics, I am probably overloading myself?

I’ll be doing this routine 4 days a week since I have class 4 days a week.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello all,

I’ve recently been dealing with pain in my shoulder that after some conversations with my doctor have led to my conclusion that I am dealing with shoulder impingement. I have been attempting to alleviate some of the pain with body weight exercises in place of my usual lifting, and am yet to see any serious results. 

One exercise I have repeatedly seen mentioned is hangs off of a pull-up bar to stretch the shoulder. When I do this, it feel pretty good until I go to push my head “through” my arms and retract my scapula a bit more. This movement causes more pain, and more interestingly, usually makes my shoulder “pop” as I can literally feel one of the muscles slide forward quickly as if it was previously caught on something.  Wanted to post this here to see if anyone else had had an experience similar to this, and if so, what you did to improve your symptoms. Thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I'm 6 feet tall (183cm) and I was wondering how the tall guys are doing pullups at home on racks that are barely taller than them. I currently have a 2m power tower but looking to upgrade to a cage.

&#x200B;

I find I don't really do any good with pullups on my tower because my feet touch the ground throughout most of the pullup. I know... ""just lift your legs"" but I've done pullups at the calesthenics park (very tall bars) and its just so much better if I can stay straight.

I have very tall ceilings. I'd like a power cage that my feet don't touch the ground much or have to constantly flex my knees while using it. I also want to hang gymnastics rings.

Are taller power cages just not a thing? i should also note, I also have very long arms.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"You can just buy $9 drawstring backpack and fill it with rock or sand and use it for push-up and dips and pull-ups etc. I also carry it up and down a hill and hold it in my arm close to my chest and do lunges and calf raises etc.. I’m also doing front raises for deltoids with it as well. 

This backpack is very thick for a drawstring backpack and is holding well with about 50 pounds of rocks in it. I’m away from home for 6 weeks and this and some push-up bars and TRX handles connected to a rope over a tree limb in the back yard are doing wonders. 

You may want to get a few thick heavy duty black trash bags and put them over each other and put them into the back pack and then fill the backpacks with rocks or sand and once filled cut off the excess bag and tie it off. 

I find this backpack is better than a weight vest as I actually hurt my shoulder while doing pull-ups with a weight vest. The loop that goes over the shoulders on the weight vest was very thick and dense and I assume what it did was displace my should and arm where it connects to my body and made me do a pull-up at a not so normal angle and injured my shoulder. With these thick drawstrings you won’t get that. Also, they don’t hurt as much as you might think, the drawstring cord is probably 2/3rds of an inch thick.

"Hi all, espec.those who procrastinate or have difficulty with choosing a routine or sticking to it. My take :
I started more than a couple of times...Ive got a lot of books.....

My AHA moment was yesterday....I ve got a chronic depression and Borderline Pers.disorder and choosing or sticking to something is what I found hard with BW.

But

After starting 2y ago but 3 times stopping/ not going to the gym ( anxiety and/ or Covid) I did this and maybe it will help someone else?

I did not know if I would loose weight And gain muscle / how to choose a routine,so I began with this: 1300kcal/ a day and once a week not. And Every day I go down on the floor and do pushups. Perfect form,5 times and first only 1 or 2, now 7 eacht time.
Mostly 2 in the morning, 3 after noon.

I just know I need to do this 5times. Thats it.


After 3 months my hips stick out. I see some abs. My arms are muscular  and my back and chest too. I lost for my feeling 2kgs, but weigh 1 kg less so maybe even gained muscles?I just see result and now I incorporate my pullups/ dead hangs/ active hangs. 5 times a day. Nothing on sundays. 
Each day I try to walk 1 or 2 hours  / 10.000 -15000 steps.
Thats it.

Now I see I did this and it has results, I am going to up it more.
Maybe even 3 times a week a circuit. Or not.

But these small steps, just 5 times laying on the floor and pushing up, changed me.

Hope this helps someone like me/ with startup problems :))","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi everyone, 23 yo male here. I had been lifting weights for 1 year,  then I decided to switch to Calisthenics. Actually, I’m not really  interested in skills and whatnot, just really like the old street  workout and keeping things simple. My main goal is to stay lean, in shape and healthy. Infact, I also do kickboxing 2/week and run a few miles 1/2/week.   
My current physique is the following (5'9""/143-147 lbs/no idea of the BF) [https://i.imgur.com/lJAesgx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lJAesgx.jpg)

I did the RR for a few months, although I was already able to do dips and pull-ups due to my weightlifting times. Right now I’m able to do about 12 slow pull-ups in a row and 20/22 dips. I’d like to share my adjusted routine with you all. It is based on 3 days a week, typically M/W/F.

Mon  
Push ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),  
Dips 3x8-12,  
Reverse flies 2x8-12,   
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),    
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (regular grip)

Wed   
Push ups 5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 wide, 2 diamond),   
Dips 3x8-12,   
Pull ups  5x8-12 (2 regular, 1 neutral, 2 chin ups),   
Bodyrows 3x8-12 (on TRX),    
Supermans 2x8-12

Fri   
Push ups 4x8-12  (2 regular, 1 decline, 1 diamond),   
Dips 3x8-12,   
TRX reverse flies  2x8-12,   
Pull ups 4x8-12 (2 regular, 1 hammer, 1 chin up),   
Bodyrows  3x8-12 (wide grip),   
Supermans 2x8-12

I usually do abs in the morning, 5/week, several different types.

I  might want to pair up some excercises like in the RR, haven’t decided  yet. I don’t weight my push ups, pull ups and dips, not into it. Each  excercise is performed bodyweight only. I don’t train legs anymore.  Don’t judge me: my lower body is way more developed than my upper one, because of both genetics and lot of soccer when I was younger. Plus, I already use legs when I kickbox.

1. I've tried to keep push and pull excercises really balanced, have I done the same with anterior and rear delts? I’m really aware of the issues unbalance can bring, and is the medial delt stimulated rather well with the reverse flies?
2. My chest has always been my lacking part, so I was thinking of supersetting 2 sets of pushups with cable crossovers: will it be too much volume to handle or will it be just fine? I’d do that only 2 days out of 3.

"In brief: stopped taking creatine after almost 2 years, mostly out of curiosity (wanted to see what the effects might be). Within a week lost 1.5kg (expected, mostly water), but I'm not sure I've noticed any perceptible difference in my power output. Granted, I switched to bouldering as my primary upper-body exercise in the last year, so I'm not really doing the same type of training as I was in early 2020. Still have at least one day of pullups/dips training per week. 

Qs: Has anyone experienced a noticeable decline in their output post-creatine (e.g., max pullups/dips declining)? Has progressive overload slowed post-creatine?

"I have to complete so called ""fitness test"" after 2 months and I need some advices on how to train for it. Currently I've been training pretty much the recommended routine 2-3 times a week, but I have done each exercise to 12 reps before progressing and I have done 4 sets instead of 3.

Right now my strength workout is:

*L-Sit Chin Up: 10 10 10 11*

*Handstand Pushup: 8 9 9 9*

*Ring Inverted Row (feet a lot higher than hands): 9 10 10 10*

*Ring Dip: 8 9 9 9*

*Archer Pushup: 8 9 9 9*

*Pistol Squat: 9 10 10 10*

Now the fitness test I have to take is pretty simple. It uncludes ""standing long jump"", pushups and sit ups. Standing long jump I have to obiviously jump as far as possible and pushups and situ ups max reps in 1 minute.

I have to get **at least** 110 points from the test and the points are calculated like this: 

*1 rep in pushups and sit ups counts as 1 point.*

*standing long jump points = distance in meters x 20*

And for max points I would have to get :

*2,7m standing long jump*

*53 sit ups*

*48 pushups*

How would I go on about training for these as my current routine doesnt really seem to be that benefitical for such a test. I dont know how many situps I can do right now or how long I can jump, but as for pushups I could manage to do only 31 reps when I just tried.

Should I ditch my current workout for now and change how I workout completly or should I add something onto it to squeeze more reps for pushups & situps? How would one train for standing long jump?

"Hey guys/gals,

I’ve just started training Brazilian Jiu Jitzu, and I’m really enjoying it. I feel like I get a really good work out every time I go do a session. But I struggle a lot with it in some aspects like being taken down and holding certain positions because I’m just not heavy enough. I know it’s partly technique, but my coach said it’s a good idea to get heavier, considering I’m quite light for my height. I used to be a pro level cyclist, so really quite light, especially my upper body. I’m 25, male, 200cm tall and I usually hover around 82-83kgs. I would  like to get myself into the high 90’s (even 100kgs if possible) if my body frame allows it. I feel like resistance training with my body weight would be the most efficient way to build lean muscle mass, and just wondering how I should start? Im thinking just standard sorta things for now, sit ups, push ups, squats, etc to work on form before I start adding extra weight. But is there any exercises and/or tips anyone has that they swear by or something a noob like me should know? 

Also, nutrition seems like a big complicated world. At least more complicated than what I’m used to. Cycling nutrition pretty much involved carbs, carbs and a few more carbs, with some caffeine here and there. No fats, not a heck of a lot of protein compared to what most people think (it’s no secret there’s different substances used in recovery for cycling). Any nutrition advice helps a lot. I also have an incredibly fast metabolism. I’m used to eating 4000+ calories a day, especially the day after race day or during stage races.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi folks,

I have for you some tricks/hacks I use to slow down my bad habits with exercise.

# Squats while brushing your teeth!

**Bad habit**: you brush for a very short time because it's boring.

If you use an electric brush, they usually have a 2 minutes timer. Do squats as you brush your teeth in the morning and at night. You'll actually end up lasting the whole 2 minutes and getting a great workout while at it!

# 7 minutes workout before that bad habit

**Bad habit**: that extra coffee cup, that first beer or alcoholic drink, have that cigarette, etc...

Before doing something you think is not good for you, earn it with a 7 minute workout :). Btw, if you have an iOS device, you can use a free app I wrote (Handstand Quest) with no ads to follow the 7 minute workout.

# Push-ups or core every hour during work day

**Bad Habit**: You work too much. In fact, the work day mostly goes from 8 am to 5 pm with you stuck in your chair or standing.

To get your body moving constantly and avoid back/next injuries, do your favorite exercise (ex: push ups, crunches, squats, stretches, etc..) every one hour throughout the day for as many reps you are comfortable with. Feel free to change it up and keep it to 1 minute max so you keep coming back.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello everyone, thanks for anyone taking the time reading this and providing any insight. Well, I think the title is rather self explanatory. My pullup game is terribly weak. I currently weigh 158lbs (72kg) for 5'11 (1M78). 

Fresh first set of pullups without any pre exhaustion, I can maybe squeeze between 13-15 pullups. The next set, I'll do at best 10. My third, I get 7. By my fourth set, I am absolutely fried and would be lucky to get 6 reps. I don't know why this happens. Pullups is the only exercise that I find really taxing and extremely tough to get consistent sets. For context, I mainly lift weights but I've always incorporated pullups. I can get a consistent amount of reps in any other excercise. Except pullups. I'm really to a point where I think I'm unable to get 4x12 4x10 pullups.

"A few days ago I posted my way to get fit.  Another portion of it was attributed to breathwork.  Being asthmatic and a smoker, I would cough a lot and lose stamina after activities.  So, always had this breathing disadvantage.

Recently because of the pandemic, my wife keeps getting panic attacks, out of desperation she tried buteyko.  Being a skeptic, I nerdly researched it.  And it really worked for me.

1. Breathe thru the nose
2. Relax your diaphragm
3. Breathe with the help of your diaphragm

As I did my work out, I would do buteyko reduced breathing in between sets and I would easily acclimate to the stress and push more.

I felt a bit superhuman.  I slowly regained my ability to do burpees in addition to walking.  And am now working out regularly.

If not for buteyko breathing, I'd still be having coughing fits.

Learning to breathe when you exercise is really helpful.

Example (for replication on your end dear reader)

Exercise is military burpees or 8ct bodybuilders.

In between sets or circuits you take 10s - as much as you need rest.  In this rest I do reduced breathing.  And the moment I am able to breathe without making a sound even if I'm not fully rested, I can then push for another set in good form and not feel fatigue.

I thank the Bohr effect in this sense, because with the accumulation of carbon dioxide, more oxygen is spread in the body.

A simple buteyko cp breath hold is breathe normal in out, then hold.  First sign of urge to breathe. Breathe normally.

A simple buteyko reduced breathing example is 3s in, slowly exhale for as long as you can.  Some can do only 3s exhale others 25s plus.

Hope this helps :)

P.s. I'm a huge advocate of this. If you want a guided vid call regarding this, I can help you.  It's free(I'm not here to sell you anything).  I'm just not that good at English.  So dm me.

"Hi, 14M here.

So, I have been doing BWF for the past several months, almost an year.

 I started off with not being able to do a single rep of pushups. But I have progressed a lot, like getting one arm pushup, not the best form but I still work on it with archers, and getting pistol, etc. However, when I started I was doing NextWorkout's (or Igor voitenko) workout programme to start off. Afterwards, in the summer, I decided to switch to Push/Pull routine and I haven't tried RR ever in my life. I have seen some improvements to my physique too. I am still doing the Push/Pull/Legs routine, BWF style. But, I was thinking if I should switch to the RR instead. 

My main goal is to build muscle but get stronger too. But is it a little late for me to get the benefits out of RR now, as I having been doing Push Pull split? If I switch to it, will I increase my chances of achieving my goals in a shorter timeframe? 

One more thing: I do not have a pull up bar, I might get one for Christmas but I do have a resistance band which I use for biceps, legs and back.

In case you guys might want to know, I do not intend to show off or anything:

I can do 10 pull ups, bar to almost sternum, I try to go as explosive as possible.

I can rep out more or less 10 pistols if I am warmed up properly.

I can do 11 to 12 Archer pushups on each side too, if properly, successfully warmed up.

"Hi all, I may have posted about this before so forgive the redundancy if so. I struggle a LOT with improving my performance and fitness through exercise, and I mostly do bodyweight exercise though I used to do squats with weights prior to a hernia. 

I make virtually no progress with my workouts and I'm trying to figure out what I can do. For pull ups, week after week I make no improvements and I've tried implementing a variety of different advice and philosophies: slower, controlled repetitions, pointing my index fingers up to help engage lats more, only working out 1-2 times a week to give adequate rest, consuming more protein, etc. I'm stuck at 3-4 sets of 3-5 reps of pull ups and around the same amount of chin ups  or neutral grip in one session.

This same kind of stagnancy is present with my other exercises like push ups but to a much lower degree than pull ups. I can't seem to progress with adding reps to tough push up types like pseudo planche push ups but I'm slowly adding them to easier variations like diamond or inclined push ups.

I'm about 5'11 and 145 lbs on average though been eating a LOT to inch towards 150. I eat pretty healthy though I know I'm not getting an ideal amount of protein (maybe 80 grams a day on a good day), but honestly I see guys making progress with way worse diets and discipline.

Finally, even when I'm careful to move slowly through my routines, rest well, drink turmeric etc., I always end up with tendinitis in my elbows. I've given myself weeks off to fully heal, and all that seems to do is make it so normal routine movements like grocery runs create the flare ups rather than exercise. Maybe this issue is more suited to r/medical_advice but I figured I'd see if anyone has input here.

Sorry for the long post but I think it's important to give the full context as I haven't been able to find situations quite like mine from my own research. Thanks in advance for any insights.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi guys, I've been following the RR for 6 months and I've improved a lot strength-wise but I'd like to target muscle hypertrophy (size) now. 

My first question is: should I do more total volume with less reps per set or more reps per set but less total volume to target muscle size? Let's take bodyweight dips for example:

4 sets x 8 reps = 32 reps | more overall volume but less reps per set

3 sets x 10 reps = 30 reps | less overall volume but more reps per set

I tried doing my research but I can't figure out which one is better than the other for size (dips are just an example in this case). I think the first one should do it since I theoretically have more time under tension. The ""set ranges"" for hypertrophy I keep seeing are 2-3 sets so I'm kind of confused on what approach I should take. 

I also have other misc. questions that I can't really figure out by myself:

\-Are 4x5 Pull ups and 3x5 Chin ups ""enough"" for back development? I don't feel like adding extra rows and such because my back is pretty sore after chin/pull ups.

\-Is it still worth it doing pull up negatives after being able to do a 5x5 pull up comfortably?

\-Since my regular chin ups are still not in the ""hypertrophy range"" is it a good idea to do 2x12 Australian chin ups after my regular chin ups to maximize bicep size gains?

Thanks in advance.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi!

I’m quite the rookie at calistenics as I’ve only been working for about 6 months. I would still consider myself close to average since I can manage 10+ pullups and 15+ dips(not trying to brag just so you know my approx. current strength).

So my question is regarding exercises that target the lower back. In the program I’m following there are Skin The Cat exercises. I can’t really do them without bending my arms, but other than that I had no problem with them. But a month or so into doing them I started to get severe back pain. Taking deep breaths would physically hurt for example. So I simply stopped doing them altogether.

I’m not sure if this is because the exercise is really difficult and shouldnt be done until proper strength has been achieved. Or perhaps im doing it wrong? 

So I’m just looking for some advice as to how to move forward. Are there any other good exercises for the lower back that I could swap it out for? 

Thanks in advance!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey bodyweight fitness community! I (33M) have been training (recommended routine) on and off since lockdown, around May of 2020. Before this I had no formal training and pretty minimal workout experience.  I have really come to appreciate this community for its guidance and impact. I recently moved to a new place, and have my own gym set up at home, and as I'm starting to get back into training, I decided to reach out and get some advice/feedback on my form.

I usually train with weights, either a dip belt or a weight vest, but decided to hold off jumping back into that until I've worked out the kinks in my form.

First up is ring dips: [https://imgur.com/a/HdfUS4W](https://imgur.com/a/HdfUS4W)

To really capitalize on your weight loss mission objectives it is imperative that you avoid these 7 common mistakes that people make when undertaking the challenge of setting fitness weight loss goals.

**1. All or None Mentality**  
You want so badly to lose the weight that you get caught up in the whole line of thinking that since you only lost a certain number of pounds within a specified period of time; you decide to blow it all off! Hold on a minute! You did not gain all of the additional body fat in just a few weeks! Be realistic and patient!

**2. A Super Strict Diet**  
First, forget the ""diet"" crap! You should have menu planning and healthy lifestyle thinking that aligns you with tasty, high-octane fat-burning foods! The biggest action step that you are really taking is to get the empty-calorie carbs foods and drinks out of your house!

**3. Too Few Calories**  
If you go down this road your body will go into a state of protection or starvation mode and attempt to slow the body's metabolism. Once you eat something... Whamo! It gets converted to stored body fat. Wait a minute, isn't that what you are trying to get rid of?

**4. Working Out Alone**  
Since the process of working out can be a challenge at times, it certainly would be nice to have a workout buddy. This is a very powerful strategy to take advantage off and over the course of your fitness weight loss goals, it's an excellent support system.

**5. Missing Breakfast**  
You have heard it many times before and the old adage is true: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It will kick-start your get your metabolism and help you from getting too hungry and overeating! An excellent time for a protein drink consisting of whey or soy!

**6. No Food Diary**  
If you don't know where you are going, you are not going to like where you wind up! This is really to help you monitor what you are consuming as you start this new healthy living lifestyle. It is also good for helping you to do menu planning and learn about different, new foods that you are introducing to your body! Keep an honest food diary for at least 30 days.

**7. Setting Unrealistic Goals**  
Avoid setting goals that even the most devoted fitness enthusiast couldn't meet. Can you really cut out all sodas, if you're used to downing a 2-liter bottle each day? Is running 4 times around the track doable, when you just started walking last week? Your goals should be attainable, without crushing you to a pulp and causing you undue hardship, discouragement, and despair.

Please kind in mind that this is not an overnight process! Be patient with yourself and stay steady on the course and you will easily obtain your desired targets in health, weight, and fitness!

That's it for now! Just keep those thoughts in mind and you will manage just fine. If I can be of further help, just let me know. Best of success to you in your health and fitness weight loss goals.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Dear Redditors,

Last week I posted a question about starting with calisthenics again. Thanks to your advice I started with the BWF Primer, and I am now in my 2nd week (day 7). Everything is going well! Eventually I came to the realization to change my regular push ups to knee push ups. Because of my medication I need more time for my muscles and probably add 2 more weeks with the BWF Primer. After this I am planning to start with the RR.

Despite my medication, I consider myself active. I have an average of 15000 steps a day and cycle to work and back around 60 km a week. 
 
I hope I gave enough information. If you need to know more, just ask! 

Nevertheless I have a question about my food intake. I am eating healthy and eating around 2500 calories a day.

Here’s my situation:

At the moment, with the BWF Primer, I am almost training every day. On Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday 
I add a 5k run after finishing with the BWF Primer. 

When I start with RR I will do BWF on M - W - F and ending every training with a 5k run. On Sunday I will go for a long easy run. Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are for rest. 

I am 38 years old, 181 cm and 75 kg. I consider myself a skinny fat person. I don’t have any fat on my chest. Only around my abdomen. And I want to lose that belly fat and gain (some) muscles.

But I don’t know how. I am reading lots about cut and bulk, bulk and cut and gaintaining. But I actually don’t know what to do, what to choose, and what to do on my days of rest.

Apologies for the bad English.

Thank you!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I came up with the idea of testing my body to see if I could start exercising again. I started doing 100 jumping jacks, 30 knee push-ups (too heavy right now), and 30 second plank whilst playing basketball, I started Tuesday and just got finished with my little workout. But during the past few days I've noticed a big change in my body. I didn't lose weight but my form is starting to come back. For the last few months I've grown taller and stayed the same weight from 2020 but up until a few months I looked out of shape. Thanks to playing football I gained a somewhat muscular form and the exercises have made me feel better. My calves have started to get harder and you're able to see the muscle outline of them, My arms are getting a little more toned and I'm able to jump higher. I've always been able to do planks but now I feel as if my stomach has gotten tighter. And I look good in hoodies now. I'm starting to believe I have fast metabolism because it's only been a few weeks or it's just a placebo affect but either way I'm loving it. But dew to my weight my back has been starting to hurt after I landed wrong after a layup. it hasn't been the full week but I think it'll be even better once I start to do this full time, I've also noticed a boost in confidence when out in public. After this I'm thinking of getting into strength training but I don't think my parents will listen, I've tried losing weight in the past but they keep supplying me with junk food and the urge is hard to resist. I'm also thinking of getting into boxing for endurance since I'll be trying out for the basketball team next semester.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"So i'm a 16 year old boy and i've been overweight for around 7 years. i decided to lose weight since november 2020 and it's been going pretty decent so far. I was 160 cm(5'2 ft) and 80 kg(177 lbs) when i first started, just plain overweight. And now i'm 165 cm(5'4 ft) with 60 kg(135 lbs). Until like 3 months ago, i only cared about  calories in n out with extreme 1300-1200 calories a day. Of course that led me to lose so much muscle and leaving me with a skinny fat look that i have now. I decided to just cut the calories super low again and lose weight(yes even muscle) because i tried to maintain/build muscle mass while losing fat at the same time and i found it really hard and just didn't work out for me. However, yesterday i checked my 1rm of chin-up cause i was just curios about it. Now i wasn't able to do a single chin up until i became 66 kg(146 lbs) which was 4 months ago. But yesterday, i was able to do full chin up while wearing a backpack filled with 25 kg(55 lbs) of stuff. I was heavier than i ever was with that backpack!(60+25=85 kg) even heavier than before i started losing weight. But there could be just one lame answer to that. So as i mentioned before, i tried to lose weight and build muscle at the same time with a reasonable 1800 calories a day and also calisthenics strength training 4-5 times a week. i did that about a month but there was just no visible change. so does that mean that 1 month of proper workout increased my strength that much without any physical change ? But that wasn't the only workout i threw in since the whole weight loss started. I been doing 100-200 pushups a day for 7-8 months till last september but it's hard to be called a proper workout. Because i didn't know anything about near failure, reps, sets so i've just been doing some pushups throughout the whole day so i doubt that did anything to my strength. So if you know the reason why i built strength while being on a crazy calorie deficit, please let me know.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I've been doing the recommended routine for about 3 years now.  Absolutely love it and got me to a place where I feel fit and proud of my physique.

Had a couple injuries (skateboarding) and took the month of December off to heal.  Just last week I started easing in little workouts.

Would it be viable to essentially stretch the recomended routine over the 8 hour work day?  Like many I now work from home, and I'd rather immediately start working with small breaks every hour than my previous workout schedule of 1 hourish in the mornings.

"Is it okay to also do regular workouts while doing push ups everyday? How will it affect my muscles being able to rest/ grow from workout to workout?

I also don’t have access to a gym, so I’m using adjustable dumbells at home, along with bodyweight workouts, like pushups, dips. I’m going to add planks and other bodyweight only ab workouts, but I want to get into a routine first. 

My intention of doing 100ish pushups everyday is to get into a routine of working out (I have adhd and struggle with consistency without routine.) Also, I’ve read that 100 pushups everyday is a great to start building up strength. Lastly, having a tangible goal of 100 pushups to do everyday will hopefully help with motivation and momentum with other workouts too. 

Furthermore, I know that the number of 100 pushups isn’t really important. I’ve been more focusing on doing as much as I can throughout the day. I’ve been doing mostly wall pushups, but trying to do 20 or so floor pushups for variation and training. Are wall pushups effective? Or should I try to build up to more floor pushups? I’m using knees for floor pushups right now. I also can’t do regular floor pushups because they hurt my wrists, so I’ve been using a bar and in the past I’ve used my fists. 

I would love to hear any tips/ advice, but my main question is how pushups everyday will interfere/ affect with needed muscle rest for growth with other workouts.

"Hi, I will get straight to the point:

Would you consider this a good hypertrophy workout for chest and arms?

Archer PU: 3x9

Explosive push ups with 3 sec negative: 3x8

Diamond Incline PU: 3 sets, 15-13-20 (high rep for metabolic stress)

Flyes on floor with socks instead of rings: 3x8 (It is tougher than it looks, I found it [here](https://youtu.be/m4xE_jfSDyQ) at 12:26 mark.)

Pseudo Planche PU: 3x6-8
Dips: 2x8 (with resistance bands)

Rest time: 30 to 60 seconds between sets.

Is there anything I should remove or add to make sure I am getting the most out of my workout?

PS: I only have a resistance band.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Before the pandemic I did not work out. 

During the pandemic I wanted to get fit and started body weight fitness (also used bands). I made definite progress in the hypertrophy department but eventually hit a peak. I ended up buying a squat rack for my home and started lifting weights. Of course, I made a lot more progress in the hypertrophy department this way.

I have navigated away from body weight fitness and exclusively do weightlifting. The sole reason I have is that I get more hypertrophy results faster with weight lifting. I know I could have continued to do both, but the novelty of exercising has kind of gone away, so I just want to minimize the time I spend on it.

How about you guys? Have any of you returned to weight lifting since the pandemic ended? Do you continue to do body weight fitness or have you quit? What are your thoughts on body weight fitness vs weight lifting now after having extensive time doing both? Do you prefer one for certain results and prefer the other for different results?","bodybuilding, fitness"

"I noticed why the jogging in between burpees is essential.  Because normally we don't really pay attention to the calves.  Doing it this way gives the calves some work.

Also the gtg style of it can make you do 27+ sets throughout the day.  Hehe feels fantastic if you have time to do it. else the 8 sets a day is enough.

Breath work and stretching helps with recovery.

Weird thing is my bodyfat seems to fluctuate, which I believe it's just because the error of skin calipers.  So roughly 14%+.

Then the peanut butter really helped as my workout supplement. Hehe

Another thing I've noticed, is low intensity lot of volume actually made me stronger.  I was able to climb the monkey bars with little issue.  And finally,

"To keep it simple, I have a fitness exam coming up for the first time in a long time. In that time I seriously let my body go by putting on 30 pounds (I’m a 6’2” male early 20s, peaked at 215 lbs) and allowed the muscles I need to deteriorate significantly. As of a couple months ago I was placed on a medication that as a side effect  curbs appetite and I’ve been capitalizing on it by fasting a day or two at a time and cutting down portions when I do eat. So far I’ve lost 20 pounds and have noticed significant fat loss. 

My exam is in a month and a half and I’m not where I want to be. I can pass but that just simply isn’t going to be enough for me, I’ve set a goal I want to reach and I need to know if it’s possible to reliably build up the muscles required for the test (push-ups, sit-ups, and a run) while simultaneously fasting periodically.

My workout routine consists of a 3 part push-up routine that cycles diamond, standard, and wide push-ups until exhaustion for 3 sets. In between the rotations I’m doing a 2 part sit-up routine where I’m doing half sit-ups on the lower half to failure, then the second part is the upper half of a sit-up to failure. I follow this routine every other day and run on the days in between. I’ve been seeing progress but it just simply isn’t enough. If I have to focus on either maximum muscle growth or maximum weight loss, which would yield better results?

Cons: Its a bit expensive eventho money is not a issue. I think it would wobble when doing exercises on it. I would have to do pull-ups and muscle-ups in an L position because of height.

"I recently got a watch that tracks my heart rate, and while tracking my weekly routine, I noticed I spend about half my time (total is ~1hr workout) in zone 0, so below 96bpm, and the rest in in zone 1 (115-133bpm), and a couple minutes where it peaks to zone 2 or 3 the highest it gets in ~160bpm when I do burpees to warmup in the beginning.

A while ago, I came up with the idea for an app that would generate a random workout based on a series of parameters (equipment owned, ability level, duration of workout etc).This was when I was between programs but still wanted to work out, but wasn't sure what to do for the workouts.

The way I'd see it is like this

1. Enter the parameters needed (equipment, ability, muscles to work etc)
2. Press a button
3. Have a workout ready to do that is tailored to your requirements

Simple as that. Now obviously this isn't designed to replace a dedicated workout program, but is rather for the times when you want to workout but don't know what to do. Eg, in between programs

After I'm done with 531, i start with **RR Bodyweight** complementary exercises.

* Pull ups / Dips - 3x8
* Planche pushups / Horizontal rows - 3x8
* Leg raises / Arch raises - 3x12
* I rest around 1.5 minutes between exercises

Once done I do a bit of stretching and that's it. I'm done.

"Currently I'm working out 4/5 days a week. I'm lifting weights for about 70-90 minutes, after that I ride my bike (hometrainer) for an hour every time. I've been doing this for a year and a half, but I don't think I can do it anymore this way. On a lot of days I'm eating dinner at 9.00 or 10.00 in the evening, because that's when I'm done with my workout. (It's almost a 3 hour workout in total)

When I started years ago I did zero cardio. That was fine, but at some point I started to look like a powerlifter, wasn't really what I was going for... so I started doing all that cardio. 

I'm now taking a week off, because I think I'm overtrained. When I'm starting again, should I just do the cardio on my rest days? Or maybe in the morning?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey guys 😊 

I just put together a video of my 10 years journey with Calisthenics, handstand and movement training. I have spent months digging through old hard drives, online drives, SoMe archives etc and a lot of time cutting this piece of content together 😅 

[my 10 year Calisthenics progress](https://youtu.be/ODhoHVp4QoI)

For a more detailed picture for you guys, here are some more specifics:

I had some background in the gym in high school before 2011. Just the average “wanted to pack on some muscle so I did bench press and biceps curls 2 times a week”.

I could also do handstand walks and wall assisted handstand from playing around on my trampoline and back yard. Other than this I did football (soccer) for a long time, but skateboarding was my main thing from middle school through high school. 

I am 179cm tall and in 2011 I weighed in at about 71kg. I am now 82kg. Body fat % never measured, never cared.

Here are the yearly milestones achieved from when starting Calisthenics in 2011:

Starting stats:
3 pull-ups, about 40 push-ups and dips (don’t remember the number)

2011:
Somewhere between 5 and 10 pull-ups (remember I didn’t achieve 10), 1st wall assisted handstand push-up, one arm push-up.

2012:
First free standing handstand, 10+ pull-ups, tuck planche, dragon flag and 10 leg raises.

2013:
1st freestanding HSPU, improved handstand (maybe around 30 sec hold and started working in form), back lever, human flag and 1st muscle up.

2014: 
1st 90 degree push-up, improved handstands, hollow back handstand, 1st shitty straddle planche hold.

2015:
Improvements everywhere, first one arm pull-up (barely and lost it later due to injury), started training for one arm handstand.

2016:
More focus on mobility, improved strength and rep numbers for HSPU, 90 deg, MU, etc. And started working more on explosive HSPU work and creative strength sequences.

2017: 
1st one arm handstand holds (10s best, but inconsistent), 1st straddle Planche press,

2018:
Focused a lot on street workout for my last year of competing, started training different OAHS shapes (flags, tuck, full etc.)

2019:
1st inverted muscle up (bar), 1st OAHS to croc, 10 reps of 90 degree push-up, started training for the one arm handstand push-up (due to an injury preventing me from training the 90 degree range).

2020:
More creative strength work and improvement in most strength exercises. One arm handstand improved a lot (very consistent holds and shapes).

2021: 
1st full planche, 1st full front lever, 1st time 2 reps of one arm chins. Improvement in everything else too. Big improvements in one arm handstand push-up training. 

It may also be of interest to you guys to know about the injuries I have sustained through the years😅

Tennis elbow (maybe 4 rounds on each side), golfers elbow (2 rounds left arm), tendinitis of long biceps head, partial separation of AC joint (what had me start my OA-HSPU training), labrum tear of left shoulder, 2 MC joint sprains (had to do my HSPU training in knuckles for a few months), wrist sprain from twisting my hand, forearms splints (on and off for 2 years in the beginning of my journey), the occasion pulled muscle (mostly chest and lats).

As my training has grown smarter and I have focused more on preventative work and mobility, injuries are less frequent the past few years😊 

Hope this can of help for some of you and happy New Years🎉

*EDIT 1: regarding questions if I use weights in my training 

No, I don’t and I haven’t since I started Calisthenics. This is not because I think using weights is inferior, but because it is not in line with my goals. Specificity is key and it has been the most efficient way of reaching my goals. Yes, you can get a stronger HSPU by doing strict press, but you get an even stronger HSPU by training your HSPU (or it’s regressions). In the same manner, you get a stronger strict press by training HSPU, but an even stronger strict press by training strict press. 
Using weights is however easier, especially regarding programming and forcing progression. There is however many ways of creative programming that works well with Calisthenics too and I have found this challenge to be very interesting and fun 😊

*EDIT 2: regarding questions in my diet

I have tried most diets and with the realisation that there is no such thing as a best diet, or a magical diet, I have ended up with what you can call conscious eating. 

I don’t count macros (but I have at some point which I think can be a good idea for a limited time to get better knowledge about what different food contains), I don’t eliminate any kind of macro, and I eat wholesome, healthy food. Based on experience and knowledge, I obviously make sure I eat enough protein, I stay away from refined sugars and also make sure my diet is rich in micro nutrients by including plenty of greens and nuts. 

I also eat a lot of fats from a variety of sources. Animal fat, omega 3 from fish (If I don’t eat fish I supplement with fish oil), and fat from nuts. 

Regarding carbs, I generally consume mostly slow carbs (but not exclusively) and make sure my meals are low GI to stay satisfied for longer and prevent blood sugar dips throughout the day. 

If I find I am gaining weight, I cut down a bit to see the weight normalising within a couple of months. 
I eat about 4 meals a day because that’s what I feel most comfortable with.

I am not at all saying that this is the best diet, but for me it’s a way of eating that makes me feel good and that I can stick to and fell good about 😊 

That being said, I also think that waaay too many people over complicates their diet and end up spending more time and energy on their diets than on their training. I think that old saying that fitness is 80% diet is BS, especially if training is skill and strength based. Training hard and consistent is your best bet. Diet can optimise your training for sure, but if you eat generally healthy and get your macros, there is not much magic to be gained by following super strict and specific dieting. Everyone is also different and react differently to different diets, so spending time (and will take a long time) finding the diet that works best for YOU is probably the best 😊 If main goal is body building, things may be a bit different, but I don’t have enough experience with this to make an educated comment.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I've been doing pull ups for half a year, Initially I could do 5, the amount of reps rapidly increased in the first few months, but I've been stuck at 15 pull ups for 3 months now. Last two weeks I've been actively trying to break through it by doing pull ups everyday, trying to get to 10x5 pull ups with 3 minutes rest in between, but with zero improvement. Every session goes almost exactly like this:
3 sets of 10 pullups
1 set of 9 pullups (failure)
1 set of 8 pullups (failure
1 final set to failure (more sets if I fail to reach 50 total pull ups).

I have no clue what's going on. I'm making no progress and even though I'm going to failure everyday I have practically no soreness, which might imply that I'm not training my body, even though I'm really trying to push my limits.

What do I do?

TLDR:
Plateau'ed at pull ups, currently doing 5 sets a day (some sets to failure) but not improving.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Curious if you guys have noticed similar things. I did a large variety of shoulder exercises, and it feels like my performance with pullups has gone noticeably down when compared to per say a bench/dip day. Currently shoulder strength is the priority.

However something i do notice is that doing chest first has never really caused too much of an issue, tho with lots of shoulder pressing/hs work the performance definetely goes down in relation to what it was if i had benched instead of shoulder pressed pre pullup M bench vs M shoulder press and then pullups tuesday.

Might be worth doing pullups at the start of the week at some point if i wanna see my peak performance.

Have you guys noticed a similar experience?

I am curious if anyone else here has had similar results, on a similar program.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hello I'm a male teen, I've been working out for almost a year, though I've only started taking calisthenics seriously in the last few months and have been enjoying it greatly. I was setting out some goals for 2022. One of these was the Front lever. After doing some research I discovered that I needed to strengthen my pull strength (current pull up PR is 10 reps) and core strength. Just to state I absolutely love working out and I have no problem being motivated. This shouldn't take me a few months before starting out on the proper front lever progressions but I was wondering if u thought mastering the front lever was a realistic goal for 2022 or am I being set up for disappointment?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So there was another thread today on whether Cbum really deserved to win a third time and is starting to plateau / competition is starting to catch up quick. I had commented that it was a pity there weren't any high quality pictures to compare for ourselves.

I think Chris is easliy beating him in these 3 poses, especially the detail in lower body (check out the feathering in the quads, Ruffins are pretty smooth looking in comparison).

"My RHR has increased from 61bpm to 65 bpm since 10 days ago (Dec 16). It even went to 66 one day. This is very abnormal for me as my RHRs were very stable for a year (average was 59-60 bpm).

One thing I can think of is overtraining. I started weight lifting on Nov 20 and increased intensity gradually. I do it 30 mins a day everyday. I don’t have a rest day. And I did constantly feel muscle sore. I did some research and found overtraining could be a reason. So I stopped my training for 3 days but my RHR is still 65 bpm today.

I also learned increased muscle mass might be a reason but there wasn't too much scientific study about it. My weight increased 3kg in the past month, which is very significant.

Has anyone experienced this? Or could it be Fitbit’s software update? Would like to share your thoughts. Thanks.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey there,

I’ve been quite new to calisthenics. Originally I am coming from regular body building. I’ve always combined normal body building with a few calisthenics movements. So I would say I have a solid base when it comes to basic skills and especially strength. 
My goal is building more strength and endurance as well as a good muscle growth. 
Here is the routine I designed so far:

Push A:
10 diamond push ups 
Rest 10 secs
30 air squats
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

8 parallel bar dips
Rest 10 secs
30 secs burpees
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

30 sec plank
Rest 30 sec 
10 leg raises 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times


Pull A:
8 pull ups 
Rest 10 secs
20 air squats 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

12 Australian rows
Rest 10 secs
1 min box step ups 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

30 sec dragon fly hold 
Rest 30 secs
10 knee side raises hanging 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Push B:
12 pike push ups on parallets 
Rest 10 secs
10 deadlifts
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

8 archer push ups
rest 10 secs
8 straight bar dips
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

12 crunches 
Rest 30 secs
30 sec plank
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Pull B:
12 chin ups
Rest 10 secs
20 air squats 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

6 wide grip pull ups
Rest 10 secs
10 burpees
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

20 sec L-sit hold hanging
Rest 30 secs
15 crunches 
Rest 1 min - repeat the pair 3 times

Before every workout I do a solid warm up for my muscles and joints. Other than that I do some skill work for handstands before the push workouts. Additionally I go for 2-3 runs a week. 
Since I am new to making my own calisthenics workout routine I am a bit unsure if this routine is solid for making progress.

"Hello everyone!
I started working out a couple of months ago at home, training in a PPL routine 6 days a week.

On push day I do 6 sets of pushups, 3 of them with added weight in a backpack, followed up by 3 sets DB presses, 3 sets of Flys, 4 sets of OHP and 3 sets of Triceps Dips.

First of I wanted to ask if this is enough to build muscle, i do this workout 2x a week. I‘m a beginner, weight 68kg at 185cm. (19 / male)

My Problem:

I noticed that my DB press really suffers when I do it after the pushups, I can almost double the reps if I do DB press first, but if I do it first I‘m barely able to do Pushups afterwards, no weighted Pushups.

For building muscle, should I do the DB presses or pushups first? Does it even matter or am I allowed to switch up the order based on my liking on that day? 

I hope its okay I‘m asking this question here, because I‘m including Dumbbells…

Sorry if this question is dumb and I‘m just overthinking, I just feel like there is so many things that can „ruin your gains“ according to YouTube, litteraly drives me crazy.

Thank you for every bit of help and greetings from Germany!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm honestly really impressed with how far calisthenics training has brought me.
I've mostly been doing the fundamentals to build muscle because I was scrawny and I'm now moderately bulky but not at the physique I originally intended to get to but my strength gains are amazing. 
I started training at the gym last August but had little to no success due to inconsistency. 
But around Feb I bought a pair of Rings and made my own Paralettes using PVC and grinded the ever living crap outta exercises and progressions to do pullups, Pseudo Planche pushups, Archer progressions, Pistol Squats, Handstands etc.
And now that I'm back at the gym again, my basic lifts(Bench Press & Deadlift) was amazing compare to the last time I was at the gym. Planning to start going on a cut to start doing the skills part although I was already doing quite a few tucked variations even though they're very small time periods.

Before Calisthenics journey, 
30kg Bench Press, no deadlift cuz I wasnt training that, 3 Reps Pullups, 6 Reps Dips. 

Current I'm at 70kg Bench Press, 115kg Deadlift, 10+ Reps Pullups, 15 Reps Dips, BW+15kg 6 Reps Dips, BW+15kgs 6 Reps of Pullups.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I spent 2021 getting in the best shape I've been yet with mostly weightlifting, cardio, and tackling my diet. For reference I'm 22, 5'11"" and weighing in at about 165-170lb with 14% bodyfat. I work out 5 days a week and have recently started to include a lot more calisthenics. Now I'm curious if doing this daily is not only safe but will help me see the progress I want. Ideally, I'd like to get my bodyfat percentage down to about 9-11% while still retaining my muscle mass or even increasing it. Below I'll post my typical workout routine and calorie intake. I'd appreciate any and all criticisms, suggestions, and advice! I repeat my calisthenics rotation prior to weightlifting each day, in my list below after Monday I'll refer to it as ""Calisthenics rotation"" to shorten the post length.

Mon: 1 mile run to warmup 

Pullups, Chin-ups, Dips - 3 sets each until fail

25 squat jumps, 50 crunches, 20 pushups, 10 burpees, 30 seconds calf jumps (3 sets each, or until fail)

4-5 leg focused weightlifting workouts. (Squats, sumo squats, calf raises, hamstring curls etc.) 

Tue: 1 mile run warmup

Calisthenics rotation 

5-6 Weightlifting exercises varying between biceps, triceps, and forearms. 

Wed: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation

5-6 Chest focused weightlifting exercises (Bench, fly, incline barbells etc.)

Thur: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation 

4-5 Shoulder focused weightlift exercises (Military press, shrugs, front/side raises etc.) 

Fri: 1 mile run 

Calisthenics rotation 

4-5 back focused weightlift exercises (deadlift, lat pull down, rows etc.) 

Sat/Sun: Rest days 

BMR estimate = 1800 calories. AMR estimate = 2800 calories. Daily calorie intake = 2200-2300

I know my regimen is FAR from perfect as I'm still new to calisthenics and my goal with it currently is to increase the volume of my reps and sets in the basic categories prior to moving onto varying workouts. As I mentioned prior though I'd absolutely love to get some advice and maybe even have a new routine to tackle starting this Monday. Thank you in advance!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"One of my overall issues with BWF is what I feel is a lack of bicep work. After trying out some curls following a set of chinups to failure, it became very clear to me that for the purpose of aesthetics, bar work alone wouldn't be enough. 

I'm now doing something a little extra on the final or near-final rep of my narrow-grip chinups (I stopped doing pullups a long while back); I hold my position well above the bar. In doing this, I feel a clear emphasis on biceps/core putting in more work, and as a result I was not able to do as many curls afterwards. 

Just a small something to try in your routine.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I recently quit weight training in favour of calisthenics as I found calisthenics to be far more responsive for me in terms of hypertrophy (I still don't exactly understand why this is).

Thing is, I want to get a weighted vest because my strength is progressing quickly and the work is becoming too easy now. I would like to find a vest with a max load capacity of at least 30KG to give ample room for progressive overload.

I got one of these high capacity weighted vests in the past but it tore at the seams and I had to send it back to the seller.  So does anyone have any they can recommend? If size is a factor in recommendations, I am 6'0 and 176 lbs.

"Hello,

 I am considering getting a weighted vest for a while now, since I am not interested in building skills by performing more complex moves and I only care about health, aesthetics and strength. I have been training in calisthenics for a few months in a disciplined manner (3 times a week, decent quality training programme, decent quality diet), and a couple years in an undisciplined one (low quality training programmes, weeks and occasionally months of not training due to low morale, low quality diet). 

 I believe that a weighted vest will offer more gains in all aspects, and will achieve it in less time than pure bodyweight exercise, however I want to be sure I am making the right choice and that it is worth it before acquiring one, since they are costly.

 In case it matters, my level as of now is something like this: Can perform 30 consecutive push ups with good form, can perform 50 consecutive squats with good form, can perform 10 consecutive neutral grip pull ups with good form, can perform 100 consecutive sit ups with good form.

 So my questions are:

• Good/best time to start using one? (Right from the beginning vs after you've gotten a level of familiarity with calisthenics).

• How many kilograms should one start with? How many if someone is a beginner, how many if someone is already a calisthenics athlete who wants to advance his level?

• Your personal experiences and choices with weighted calisthenics. Any information is useful. 

 Thanks in advance.

"Hello all,

I’ve recently started training in caloric surplus in an attempt to put on mass. So far it’s been a pretty slow process. I’ve been eating in average 4000 calories a day supplementing with creatine  and I’ve gained about 2 pounds in a month. I lead a fairly active lifestyle working part time physical labor and body weight exercises for about an hour 5-6 days a week. My TDEE was calculated at 3200 calories at 6’3 200 lbs. I eat pretty clean and I eat the same things everyday. My Chronometer states I intake 125g of fiber/day. 

I’m happy with my physique so far but I would like to put more mass on my shoulders. I’m currently interested in the pursuit of the so called golden-ratio for aesthetics Are pike push-ups my best bet in the body weight realm for shoulder growth? I’ve been trying to dial in which version works best for me and I’ve been mostly practicing these two:

Standard: https://imgur.com/a/pcfnlEo

Decline full rom: https://imgur.com/a/gad1gIF

I find it pretty hard to progressively overload the decline version. In the position shown I can manage 5 sets of 7 reps. Are these effective? Should I scale back to regular pike push-ups? My goal is to be able to perform sets of handstand push-ups in order to best target the medial delts. Right now I can get 3 belly against a tree but they are super taxing, especially on my serratus strangely enough. Are there any other exercises I should experiment with as far as shoulder growth goes?

I’d like to stick to body weight exercises. It’s sort of a purist mindset of mine and I know it may be limiting my gains but I do enjoy the challenge. For reference this is how I look now after a pull workout:

"Hi all, happy new year!

I have been going over this question in my mind for a while now and I cannot seem to figure it out completely.

I’m 26 y/o (m), about 83kg, 185cm tall, and started training with weights back in November. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time and have friends who have much knowledge on fitness, so I have been able to learn a bit on the subject.

I work out (right now with dumbbells due to restrictions) about 3-6 times a week, on average more like 4-5 times.
It’s not a bodyweight routine, sorry about that, but I am not sure where else to post this - I’ve seen people getting great advice on here so I figured it’s worth a shot.

I am currently on an about 1800-2000 kcal/day diet, with a ‘zigzag’ moment in the weekends (where I eat a bit more in ‘cheat days’: around 2500 kcal on 2 days). On average, that means I have a calorie intake of about 15000 kcal a week, so 2150/day. I take 2 scoops of Whey and try to prioritise proteines in my meals (chicken & egg or sandwiches, chicken thigh for dinner, etc.); overall about 130 grams of proteine a day. I also started eating more healthily regarding my carbs (whole wheat pasta and whatnot).

I made some good progress in the meantime, but I am not sure if what I am doing is the best way to go for me right now. My friend told me my calorie intake is too low and will cause me to lose weight too quickly. 

I am not sure what to do now. I enjoy the progress I made already (as well as the speed), but I also want to do it all as healthily as I can. 

What do you guys advise me to do? Am I in the way of my own progress? Should I increase calorie intake, or keep the status quo?

"I'm getting conflicting information, with some saying you shouldn't hit the same muscle groups more than twice a day, but for a few months now I've been doing full body workouts progressively overloading 4 times a week.

- 3 sets of lateral dumbbell raises, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of one legged squats, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of dumbbell curls, 10 reps per set
- 3 sets of levitation crunches, 12 reps per set
- 3 sets of bicycle crunches, 30 reps per set
- 3 sets of that exercise you do with dumbbells to target the muscle connecting your shoulders and neck, 15 reps per set

Hi,

&#x200B;

Lurker looking for an everyday 1 hour routine to bulk up.

* Aim: gain weight given how light I am, a bit of aesthetics
* Diet: currently eating between 2800-3000 kcal a day, up to 70g protein
* Training history: a few months: started with weights with no progress; started bodyweight a few weeks ago
* Daily life: sedentary other than this workout
* Equipment: just a backpack for weight, a table and chairs for rows or support holds and a towel; no access to bars, rings, weights, etc --> So can't do pull-ups yet

&#x200B;

I've been doing the following full-body program everyday but am thinking it's too much volume. I change progression (my current progressions are in parentheses below) when I hit 12 reps. I'm following either the [startbodyweight](http://www.startbodyweight.com/) progression or the recommended routine ones.

# Current program

**Main supersets (5x8-12):**

* Pistol squat progression (weighted assisted pistol squat)
* One-arm pushup progression (decline diamond pushup)

&#x200B;

* Deep step-up progression (step-up on table with lower foot assistance)
* Row progression (horizontal underhand grip row)

&#x200B;

* Shrimp squat progression (beginner shrimp)
* Pseudo-planche pushup progression (PPPU)

&#x200B;

* Nordic curl progression (floor slide)
* Pull-up progression **(N/A, no equipment) --> superman instead??**

&#x200B;

* Sissy squat progression (sissy squat)
* Handstand pushup progression (wide pike pushup)

&#x200B;

* Dip progression (weighted one elevated leg bench dip)
* Thruster progression (weighted thruster)

&#x200B;

**Core circuit (3x8-12 or 1 min):**

* Anti-extension: Plank progression (1 min wall plank)
* Extension: Hyperextension progression (hyperextension)
* Anti-lateral flexion, abduction: Side plank progression (1 min side plank moving star)
* Anti-lateral flexion, adduction: Copenhagen plank progression (1 min moving Copenhagen plank)
* Rectus abdominus: Leg raise progression (support hold knee raise)
* Transverse abdominus: Inverted sit-up progression (tuck V-up)
* Transverse abdominus: Ab slide out progression (scissor kicks)
* Oblicus abdominus: Windshield wiper progression (bent knee windshield wiper)

&#x200B;

I was considering switching to an upper/lower and doing push/pull supersets on upper days and quad/glute supersets on lower days. Then, I'd add some isolation work. Something like this:

**Upper day:**

**Main supersets (5x8-12):**

* One-arm pushup progression (decline diamond pushup)
* Row progression (horizontal underhand grip row)

&#x200B;

* Pseudo-planche pushup progression (PPPU)
* Dip progression (weighted one elevated leg bench dip)

&#x200B;

* Handstand pushup progression (wide pike pushup)
* Pull-up progression (N/A, no equipment)

&#x200B;

**Isolation (3x8-12):**

* Tricep exercise??
* Back??
* Curl??

**Core circuit (3x8-12 or 1 min)**

&#x200B;

**Lower day:**

**Main supersets (5x8-12):**

* Pistol squat progression (weighted assisted pistol squat)
* Sissy squat progression (sissy squat)

&#x200B;

* Deep step-up progression (step-up on table with lower foot assistance)
* Nordic curl progression (floor slide)

&#x200B;

* Shrimp squat progression (beginner shrimp)
* Thruster progression (weighted thruster)

&#x200B;

**Isolation (3x8-12):**

* Calf raise?

**Core circuit (3x8-12 or 1 min)**

&#x200B;

So my questions are:

* Am I currently doing too much volume/training full body too frequently?
* Is the upper/lower split better? Will I lose muscle if I change to a lower volume program?
* Is my core circuit okay? Am I missing an essential exercise? Can I shorten it somehow?
* I've almost hit a wall with planks. Don't know where to progress from wall plank/side plank/Copenhagen plank?
* Any suggestions given the limited equipment I have, e.g. can't do pull-ups?
* Are isolation exercises useful? Any suggestions using little equipment?
* Is my diet okay? Too much given how light and sedentary I am?

"Hello all,

I’ve been trying to nail down my ring dip proficiency by trying all sorts of variations. Recently someone suggested to try hollow body dips to improve shoulder strength. I started to incorporate these into my push days. I had a tendency to let the ring turn in on the eccentric so I’ve been making a conscious effort to keep them mostly parallel and to improve my ROM at the bottom position. Currently I’m at 5x6 looking to get 5x8 of these:

Hollow body ring dips: 
https://imgur.com/a/AsL5X1D

I really feel these more in my chest. The deep ROM makes it much harder but my shoulders are healthy and allow for it. It feels good. How is my form with these? Once I reach 5x8, is it a appropriate to progress to RTO dips?

Thanks.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey, I have been working on increasing my pullup count for the past 3 months and also focused on weight loss. I think I might be going avout ot wrong since I was focusing on two goals at once and gettong stressed because I failed at both. I'm thinking I should pick just one and work on that for 2 months to achieve it. The logical one would seem then to focus all my efforts on dropong the extra weight and afterwards work on increasing pull-up count. My main concern/issue is that I will regress in strength over the 2 month period, however I can imagine it will be pretty fast to recover from in. Any advice on my situation?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I started getting back into shape around 3.5months ago by going to the gym and weightlifting. I started doing weightlifting only as a way to get myself to some sort of strength level where a calisthenics only workout would actually feel fulfilling, at least to me. I was not interested in doing scapular raises and negatives on everything. Anyways, I started at 200lb and I'm guessing around 25% bf and am now 177lb with \~17-18% bf due to a good diet and a good weightlifting regiment. I've definitely made progress in strength. The thing is, weightlifting is nice and all, but it is not what I want. I don't care about being able to lift a ton of weight, I care about being able to manipulate my body in the way gymnasts do. I am 25yo and actually did gymnastics for 6-8months when I was 8yo. I didn't stick with it and very much regret it, but hindsight is 20/20 and my patience and motivation as a child was just not ..well, mature.

On Dec 1st, I decided to try to take on the recommended routine from this sub and it felt alright, but I didn't really feel like I was able to push myself in the ways I am used to. My back definitely got worked, but my shoulders chest and legs. I'm not sure I did as much as I could have. I'm not sure a full body routine is best. Perhaps a push pull legs core style of split would be better. I feel my shoulders are severely lacking because I was having left shoulder pain about 3 weeks into lifting and had to to essentially go light on chest days and never target shoulders on their own. Only about a month ago did my shoulder pain settle and started hitting shoulders. I bought rings and tried doing a similar routine this past Friday. Rings definitely allowed me to do hit chest a bit better with the pushups on the rings. I couldn't really do dips on the rings yet and had to opt for the p-bars instead. \*\*This might be a bit messy in terms of how I am delivering this information, but I just want it all out there to get the best advice.\*\*

I want to be able to perform bodyweight skills like the planche/straddle planche, handstands, handstand pushups, press to handstand/straddle press to handstand, full back bridge, muscle ups, front and back lever, and l-sit/v-sit.

The thing is I just feel so far off from these skills for so many different factors and have no idea how to program a weekly schedule to hit everything I need to hit to accomplish all of these skills.

Currently I can do an l-sit (sort of and for not too long. I have to hold the shape on a chair and then pull myself up into it. It feels nearly impossible to bring my feet into the 90deg, I only get to 85deg).I can do a handstand against the wall, I can do 1-2 handstand push up but elbows aren't perfectly parallel (a little flared).                                                                                                                                                I tried doing pike pushups but my hamstring flexibility limits me and it feels so inconsistent in terms of difficulty, probably because my form isn't the same every time and when I am more piked it is harder. It can get so hard it feels crazy.My back bridge is terrible and looks more like a back plank..I can do good pull ups 3x8.  I cannot muscle up.                                                                                                                                                  I can do a modest amount of lean pseudo-planche pushups for a couple reps then my wrists give out.I can do somewhat adv tuck front and back lever. I haven't timed them but I would say only 5-10s. Full tuck probably 20-30s.I can do skin the cat pretty easily. Never repped them out seriously. I would say 3x10 at minimum.

I believe my flexibility and mobility are a huge limiting factor. I cannot straddle anywhere near what I should be able to in order to do any straddle skills. I believe my wrists, triceps, thoracic spine, hip flexors, hamstrings and shoulders are all just not flexible enough preventing me from back-bridge.  I want to be able to target my shoulders in a meaningful way, not just with compound pushup exercises because as I said earlier I think they are lacking.  I think a split is probably best for this. Like a chest, back, core, shoulders, legs kind of split.

I really feel overwhelmed because it feels like there's so much I need to do to achieve these goals, but I have no idea how to program an effective routine that targets my lack of flexibility and strength goals while optimizing rest. It feels like there are so many different exercises and stretches I can choose from and therefore I am overwhelmed with how to best navigate all there is to get the best for me. I feel like I need a massive excel spreadsheet just for 1 week.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm really more looking for direction more so than someone creating a routine for me (even though that would be nice lol).What stretches should I pick, when should I do them, how often?What exercises should I pick, when should I do them, how often?These are questions that I just don't know where to start with to answer.Thank you for any help.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I do push ups every workout but lately they haven't been putting any sort of strain on my triceps. When I finish a set I usually just barely managed to finish it but the only thing that felt like it was being challenged was my shoulders.

My form is pretty good, I watched a lot of videos on good form and am confident my form isn't the problem. I have a 20 pound and 10 pound laying around. What exercises do you guys use to get bigger triceps? I think my triceps stopped growing but I can't tell. I am young and can't afford a gym membership or any equipment so I have been doing body weight exercises for about 8 months now.

If there is something wrong with my ROM or my form please let me know, also if there are really effective exercises you guys do for triceps I would like to hear it. Any help is appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi guys and gals.

Here are my stats:

* 27 male
* 150 lbs / 68.3 kgs
* 5'11"" / 183 cms
* ""Skinny fat"" physique

I started to ease into calisthenics about 1/1.5 months ago and have zero clue as to what I am doing. I figured I'll just work some basic muscle groups, get a bit stronger, and then try to refine a little later. ""Better than nothing"" is the philosophy.  


Here's where I'm at today:

* 7 x pullups (strict)
* 31 x push ups (strict)
* 30 seconds planche hold (knees tucked to chest, using pushup grips)
* 13 x Incline pushups (using pushing up grips)
* 25 seconds L-Sit (90 degrees hold)
* 15 x dips
* 15 x supinated pullups
* 15 x close-grip incline pushups 
* 15 x dip crunches / L-Sit Crunch (don't know the name for this)

So this is where I'm at. Any tips/pointers? I want to start incorporating more dynamic, full body exercises and ranges of motion and start training my core and shoulders more to eventually get to a full planche (one can dream right?).  


My equipment:

* dip bars
* pull up bar (attached to door frame)
* Push up Grips
* Piano bench (lol)

Wishlist:

* resistance bands
* Rings (but I have nowhere to attach them to and train with in the winter months)
* Weighted vest
* Ab rolley thingy (not sure what it's called)

"I've been doing casual calisthenics for a while now, almost a year, but i came to a point where i'm no longer able to progressively do more reps. 

With chin-ups for example, i do an all-in first set, then my second and third set have half of the first set in terms of reps and my fourth one is basically just hanging on the bar. And since 3 months ago or so i noticed that my progress has been really, really slow, almost unable to get + 1 rep in the first set even after that long. 

That lead me to think what might be wrong, and considering that my diet is not that bad and i really try my best in each workout, i thought it may be happening because i focus too much in the first set, so, would it be better if i even out my sets and do the same amount of reps in each one?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"My family is going through a rough time at the moment between Covid and other health issues. Although I am thankfully healthy and well, I need to take care of others, especially my 8 year old nephew. On top of that work is not going well, which all adds up to a lot to deal with.

I have had to severely cut back what I do because I lack the energy and motivation to do more (staying at home because of Covid doesn't help) so I wanted to ask those that have undergone or are in tough situations how you manage to schedule your training. Do you tailor it to your emotional state or try to keep a consistent program? I'm not following a particular program at the moment, guess I'm just trying to maintain what I have.

"I was wondering if it’s possible to achieve a look like that with bodyweight excercises, and I mean without performing them weighted but just bodyweight, more like a prison workout. https://i.imgur.com/gN4x7mr.jpg

Of course in this particular case, a clean diet is essential, I’m aware of that.

All in all, he seems to have a pretty good chest, decent arms and possibly a lagging back, so my main doubt is that dips and push ups can give you that kind of chest.

I was thinking of something like that:

Chest: push ups (incline, wide, ring pushups), dips, ring flies

Back: pull ups (regular, neutral, wide, chin ups, narrow chin ups), rows (regular rows, wide rows, ring rows)

Shoulders: already working with pull ups, push ups and dips. Maybe lateral raises and facepulls

Arms: already working with chest and back excercises. Maybe ring curls and diamond push ups once a week

Legs: squats, deadlifts, pistol squats

Abs: various excercises 


I don’t want to be any bigger than that. Do you think it’s possible or should I add weighted stuff, maybe only as regards chest?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi everybody! I'm a 20M (78kg/170cm), I have a sedentary work (8:30 to 13:30) and then university classes (14:30-18:30), and i have practically no time for doing anything (I have to study at night because I work in the morning). 

As you can read, I spend a lot of time sitting on a chair, and really don't know where to start to workout because I have no equipment at home, I can't afford a gym membership (i have a lot of expenses and the salary is low) and can't go outside because I live in a cold city (the temperature goes under 0°C everyday).  


I am not satisfied with myself, I want to improve, just don't know what to do and I thought that asking advice for a suitable way to workout was a good idea.

"Hi all. I’m 46, 185 cm and 86Kg (189 lb). I started the RR every 2 days for almost 6 weeks now. I started with the basic program, but quickly moved to progressions for some exercises which were too easy. I’ve not done any weight or bodyweight training like this before, i used to be an occasional runner.

For the first 4 weeks, i did the standard no of reps (5 usually) so that my body was adjusting. For the last 2 weeks for every workout I’ve increased reps by one for everything i can.

I’m not sore afterwards, but i do find myself on my knees during the third pair. My routine is

* Scapular Pull-up (10)
* Split Squat (11)
* Parallel Bar support Hold (60s)
* Floor Slides (9)
* Incline Rows (11)
* Full Pushups (11)
* Plank (30s)
* Copenhagen Plank (20s)
* Reverse Hyperextension (15)

Should I keep adding a rep every workout till i get to 15, then move onto the next progression, or will i quickly injure myself? Should i take the progression slower?

My body is starting to transform (I’m also eating at least 3,300 calories a day including almost 200g Protein). My physio saw me this week for the first time since i started, and he cant believe the change.

"Hey guys,

I mostly just read and nevery really post anything myself but I think in this case I need some help. I am following this journey of learning to handstand for roughly 2 years now. I started as a complete beginner. Not a beginner at calisthenics but a beginner of balacing on my hands. I did all the recommended drills and somewhat managed to get a 10-15s handstand, 20 on a good day, with roughly 75% of my kickups beeing successfull - depending on how I feel that day. I regularly changed my drills and try to achieve a better line but at this point I feel like beeing stuck. At the moment I am following this plan that I created:

Handstand Routine                     Sets               Reps 

20s Freestanding Hold	        3	                  /           (20s is the goal, mostly I manage to achieve that)

Straight - Straddle	                2	                  3          (seems ok, but sometimes I fall over when closing)

Straight - Diamond - Straddle	2	                  3          (quite hard, transition causes me to fall mostly)

Wall Handstand Push Up	        2	                  3          (to build the foudnation for HS Pushups)

Kick Ups	                                2	                 10         (to get more consistent with Kick Ups of course)

Handstand Shrugs on Wall	2	                  8          (to learn to PUSH! better)

I try to do this routine usually for 3 times a week (maybe this is not enough?).

This routine is quite tough most of the time since sometimes I need to kickup 3-4 times for a hold strictly depending on how I feel that day. There are sessions where everything works like a charm and sometimes I can't manage to even get a full set in one hold. Additionally when doing straddles or diamonds I fall over often so that I have to kick up again to continue my set which strains energy of course. On some days I can finish a set of Straight - Diamond - Straddle without falling but on many I only get two or just one rep and I have to kick up again. Also beeing upside down for 20s+ is definitely a challenge for my shoulders, so it's not just balance I need to concentrate on it's strength aswell.

For shoulder mobility I do butchers block daily for 3 sets of 30s and a cat stretch for 3 sets of 30s. Thats it (I guess there is a lot of room for potential).

I seem to have the same 3 problems for a relatively long time now:

\---- Today is clearly on of those not so good days but videos might make everything a bit more clear ----

\- kick ups wont get more consistent ([https://imgur.com/a/KNLoq8x](https://imgur.com/a/KNLoq8x) \- on average I get kind of 3 out of 5 kick ups)

\- holdtime won't increase ([https://imgur.com/a/vocOScT](https://imgur.com/a/vocOScT) \- I tend to fall over after some time because my core seems to break the line)

\- form is as ""bad"" as ist was before. (Picture of my holding a HS here: [https://imgur.com/a/tbyLTM8](https://imgur.com/a/tbyLTM8) \- I tried to push up as hard as I could but my shoulder mobility limits me)

I don't know what to change and what to pay attention for additonally.

The only thing I can imagine is that I need to do my routine more often (4-6 times a week?), do way more for shoulder mobility (what stretches, excercises could I do?) and also enhance my shoulder strength (wall holds?).

I need some advice on what to pay attention to most at the moment. How to adjust my routine to get better results.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I’ve just bought a pull up bar and just tried negative pull ups for the first time, hasn’t gone well.
I’ve found that I can barely hold for one second and it gets worse.

How long should I be able to hold for it to be productive as a goal? E.g don’t bother if you can do less than 5 seconds or something?

Bwf seems to recommend 3x a week for rr, if I am very sedentary outside of working out (office job) could I up that to every other day or am I pushing it?

Given how short my holds are while I am cutting weight I may try to use resistance bands to help me with either negatives or just pull ups depending how much they help me but I am wondering when it is worth to stop using resistance bands? 

Also if anyone has any tips for someone bigger trying to build up for pull ups that is also massively appreciated, particularly with resistance bands.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey community !

I posted in this sub about a 50 days ago and i got some great advice on dieting for sedentary weight loss. The previous post can be seen [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/qo14v8/i_just_want_to_lose_my_belly_cant_walk_due_to/), in case someone wants context

I have since made improvements to my diet and only eat twice a day, within a 6 hour cycle. My TDEE was around \~1800 calories so i try to limit my intake to 1400 calories or less (the campus cafeteria has calorie labels on all the food they sell, so that's convenient)

As of November 6th 2021, i weighed around **64 kg**

Now, i weigh at around **57 kg ;** [Detailed Weight Report](https://i.imgur.com/nbrvuMr.jpg?1)

Which is great ! i lost 7 kg within 2 months' time just by eating less !

However, my belly ( which is not too huge, but midsized rather) did not go away. I did not expect it to disappear, but i was hoping for it to reduce a bit in size.

I frequently measure the circumference of my waist with an inch tape, by using the most protruded part of my belly as a baseline for measurement.

The measurement has stayed the same as before

Just to provide a perspective, i am not fat - i have somewhat thin (but not skinny) arms and legs.

So i am struggling to comprehend as to why my belly did not exhibit even the slightest reduction in size despite the weight loss ?

Realistically, how long is it going to take for me to lose my belly ?

I would greatly appreciate some advice !

" 

Hello all! My name is Jack and I am currently studying Psychology at University. Within my degree, I have chosen to research gym users' self-perception.

For my Psychology dissertation, I have decided to research the effects of extended gym use on self-perceived body image, satisfaction, and motivation. 

I believe that there is a period of time where motivation becomes lower and gym users will notice slower progression resulting in lower self-perceived body satisfaction. This may be involving levels of dopamine not reaching the same levels they used to reach after a gym session.

The questionnaire provided will be completely anonymous - the only personal data collected would be an age range and a range of time that you have attended a gym.

"Today, I was looking for new workouts on the Internet, and I came to a seemingly good article by Mens Health. However, after a quick google search apparently it is not a good source of workouts since apparently "" For recommendations from Men's Health, evidence **supported approximately 23% of the 80 recommendations**, while evidence was unclear, nonexistent, or contradictory for approximately 77% of the recommendations"". I run into this situation a lot. One site says crunches are a good workout, experts say they are garbage. Another says sit-ups are good, experts also say they are garbage. Surprisingly everybody seems to agree that planks are good although I'm sure in a few years they will be seen as garbage too. There is just so much conflicting information.

So, are there any good reliable sites with workouts that actually do something? Either recommend sites with workouts that are actually effective, sites to avoid, or workouts that work for you. I trust the various workout communities on Reddit more than I trust the 295983963959 workout sites and the Google ""experts"". I need workouts for more or less every part of the body since I do not want muscle imbalance. My current beginners workout is 40 squats and 5 bicep curls for each arm with about 15 pounds of weight + 5 incline, 5 decline, and 5 normal pushups and then 10 upper crunches. Rest for 10 min then repeat, 2 days a week. I know I probably need to up the intensity but I want to know what to drop, keep, and add before I take it to the next level. ***I prefer workouts that do not require use of equipment as I do not often have access.***","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Basic information
34M
5'9""
173lbs

I started 2021 at 200lbs and never done any sort of strength training a day in my life. Always been more of a runner. I did push ups, jumping jacks and sit ups and cardio (running) Jan-Feb this year to start dropping some weight.
Picked up a lot of stuff from Bullyjuice on youtube on bodyweight exercises then created my own circuit based on a lot of the exercises I learned from his channel.
I also do my fair share of running.

Bodyweight routine Mon/Wed/Fri

iPad stopwatch to track times.

15 Chin Ups (about 30sec)
Ankle Taps - 60sec
Rest 30s

25 Push Ups (good form about 30 sec)
Crunches 60sec
Rest 30s

Upright plank 1m25s
Steam engines 60sec
Rest 30s

Elbow plank 1m25s
Crunches 30s
Ankle Taps 30s
Rest 40s

-this accounts for exactly 10 minutes altogether. I repeat this same circuit until I hit 40 minutes. I use to do this for 60 minutes (June-Dec) but for the last few weeks have been feeling a bit weaker so toned it down a notch to 40 minutes. After the 40 minutes I will still continue other sets like below

-Chin Ups 15
Rest 30s
-Ankle Taps 1m30s
Rest 30s
-25 Push Ups
Rest 30s
-Steam Engines 60s
-Squats 30s
Rest 30s
-10 Inverted Rows
-10 Dips
(I have a dip station I bought on Amazon)
Rest 30s
-Ankle Taps 1m30s

-Upright Plank 1m30s

-Squats 30s

-10 Inverted Rows
-10 Dips

Just a variation of all this until I hit an hour or even a few minutes after. I do this Mon/Wed/Fri except for Fridays I only do 30-35 mins and a run after. 4-5 mile run. Pace depends on how I feel. Easy pace is 7mph, normal pace is 8mph, moderate is 9 and I sometimes do intervals where I will do 8, 9 and 10mph. Intervals vary.

I typically run 9 miles on Tuesday (typically faster paces), 8 miles on Thursday (typically a straight 8mph), 4-5 on Friday (interval speeds), Saturdays I will normally do a really fast run at 9mph for 6 mins then 60sec slower at 8mph then back up to 9 for another 6 mins until I hit 8 miles.
I usually will walk my dog Mon-Thurs 4-5miles at typically a 4mph pace.

All in all I feel like I am super active. I have a pretty physically demanding job doing highway guardrail. Some days are harder than others but I have yet to talk myself out of anyday of my routine.

My diet I never payed any attention to until around July 2021

I took a break from bodyweight training from March-June to try and drop weight faster so I did a lot more cardio during that time. Ever since the second week in June my routine has been pretty strict. Maybe missed maybe a day or 2 since only to let fresh tattoos heal up.

Some days I will do bodyweight training and run immediately after (I have a treadmill at home) but I will always take a quick break and eat a bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and a banana before I start my run as to try and avoid burning any sort of muscle. I also eat before I workout as well but that varies. Typically greek yogurt. Normally I have had breakfast, lunch and snacks during the day before I do my training so I don't worry much about eating before hand. If I do it's maybe a scoop of PB and a greek yogurt.

After I run my cooldown is typically walking the dog like I mentioned earlier.

Right now I'm just a little torn on what I'd like to do moving forward. Personally I'd like to go on a cut and drop more weight because I feel as if I picked up a fair amount of strength and muscle gains but am somewhat skinny fat so I feel like I need to get my BF% lower so I can actually physically see how hard I've worked this year.

Am I getting enough rest time? My workout feels pretty intense, that coupled with the running and walking I'm doing feels like a lot. Does the workout seem like too much or not enough?

Any comments/suggestions/critique welcome. 
I know I did touch base too hard on my diet but if anyone needs any of that detail I'm happy to provide some insight.
Thanks","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I’ve been on the longest journey trying to learn how to do a push up. M 6’4”, 245 lbs. I lost nearly 100lbs in the past year with body weight exercises, Kettle Bell work, and Running. I’m training for an upcoming agility exam, and I still can’t do push ups.

A few weeks ago, I was able to do my first full good form push up without kneeling. I can do two, maybe 3 in a row. I have about 4 months to do 30 for my fitness test.

To train, I’ve been trying GTG by doing a single push up several times throughout the day. And 4x a week when at the gym, I do Push up negatives then knee push ups. I feel as though I’m not progressing much. When I was about 50lb heavier, I just assumed fat guys can’t do push ups. Now that I’m getting closer to my goal weight, and still struggling, I’m hoping someone has a suggestion.

Would Dumbbell press or Bench Press help my push ups? Or should I just increase volume of what I’m doing now? I really feel as though I’m the only one struggling with this movement, it seems so basic but so unattainable.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi, I am new in the community. I just joined the subreddit. I am also a newbie in the reddit platform. I am a full-time Business Executive working at a 9-5 office structure in Bangladesh. I used to workout at the gym but as I live in the capital, traffic takes away most of my time. I get only 5 hours to spend with myself, my family and wife (which includes daily chores as well). I am currently following a routine where I do mainly three exercises. I workout 6 days a week. My sessions are very short. Because I struggle to convince myself to workout after a hectic office day. I have read the atomic habit book and incorporating some of the techniques from the book. I believe a lil every day will take me far in the journey. But, my hopes are high - my ultimate objective is to look impressive as a natural through building muscle with calisthenics. I also want to learn Wall supported handstand Pushup and one arm pullup. I have realised one arm push up is not cup of my tea. Currently, I can only do 8 strict pull ups. I am following a program to take 8 pull ups to 15 in next 5 weeks.  

Here is my routine:  


Sat Push up 5\*15, Table Dips 2\*AMRAP, BW Squat 3 sets  
Sun Weighted SandBag squat, abs. 

mon Pull up day: Pull up= 4\*4, Curls 4 sets

tues Push up 5\*15, Table Dips 2\*AMRAP, BW Squat 3 sets

wed Pull up day: Pull up= 5\*5, dead hang, plate pulls for forearm

thurs Rest

fri Pull up day: Pull up= 4\*6, dead hang, plate pulls for forearm

"Here to share some workout tips! It is quite common to see straight sets (just like straight people 😂). It goes something like this:

🌟 Push Ups for 5 sets of 5 reps (or 5 x 5). This means you do the 1st set, rest, then 2nd set, rest, then 3rd set...etc.

While this is 'straight' forward (ok I'll stop with the pun), it actually takes A LOT of time! Not to mention you'll need to rest MORE as you fatigue the SAME group of muscles! Then imagine repeating that process for 4-5 exercises! 🤯

A better way would be to do Antagonistic Pairs, which means pairing 2 exercises that uses opposing movement patterns and emphasises opposing muscle groups.

🌟 For the upper body, this means pairing a PULL movement with a PUSH movement.  
🌟 For the lower body, this means pairing a SQUAT movement with a HINGE movement.

A sample workout could be:

🅰️1️⃣ Assisted One Arm Chin Up - 2 sets x 3 reps, rest 3 mins  
🅰️2️⃣ Planche Push Up - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins

🅱️1️⃣ Weighted Pistol Squat - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins  
🅱️2️⃣ Nordic Hamstring Curl - 2 sets x 4 reps, rest 3 mins

(This means you do A1 for set 1, rest, then A2 for set 1, rest, back to A1 for set 2, rest...etc.)

This method MINIMIZES overall workout time, while MAXIMIZING rest times for individual exercises, which means you can keep the intensity high! 🥳

Trying applying this to your next workout! And comment below for questions and inquiries!

P. S. Not here to say that straight sets don't work, but they just take up too much time. I also generally advise full body or upper/lower splits over push/pull/legs, which works better for the general population in terms of rest and recovery (in my opinion, of course).","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I’ve been bodybuilding for 5 years. Progress was slow but sure. I live in Ontario Canada, where the gyms are closed now and will continue to close. While always wanting to start calisthenics but being scared of starting from scratch, I haven’t done calisthenics till now. My arms are a weak point for my physique but my chest is a strong point. After my first week training calisthenics my arms and core is in agony (good sore) but I don’t feel much in my chest. I training Monday-Friday and rest the weekends (this is best for me). I have been doing 

Monday: push (HSPU, deep dips, jumping muscle ups, and tricep extensions because my goal is a Russian dip. Then I do pike push ups, archer push ups, and idk what else yet)

Tuesday: legs (I have weights and a squat rack so I do back squats, front squats, Bulgarians, knee extensions, and hip thrusts)

Wednesday: pull (this is my biggest problem, my pulling strength isn’t the best, so I do pull ups but eccentric on opposite sides, normal pull ups superset with banded pull-ups, I tried to do assisted headbangers, and supinated rows (completely horizontal)

Thursday: legs (same as Tuesday 

Friday: push/pull fundamentals (pike push-ups, weighted deep dips, archer push ups, weighted pull ups, some sort of row and leg raises, now my problem is that I wanted to still grow my muscles so I was going to incorporate incline DB press, skull crushers and shoulder press)

Sorry it’s so long I desperately need help. My goal is be in the best shape of my life (I realized I neglected muscles doing weight training by the soreness)

-I want to maintain the muscles I have and grow the muscles I don’t
-I want to build up to the point where I can incorporate advanced movements to maximize muscle growth (Russian dips and headbangers)
So really my goal is to build muscle with calisthenics

"Hi fellow redditors, I am writing this post because I wanted to share with someon my latest achievement, the muscle up, and also because I wanted to deeply thank this amazing community for everything it has done for me. If it wasn’t for this sub I would have never started bodyweight training as I was too scared and didn’t know where to begin let alone achieving such an ambitious( of course for myself) goal.

I have always been rather fit since middle school. I enjoyed playing sport and liked the idea of working out in general. Therefore I joined my track and field club and fell in love with this sport. I was completely dedicated to training and soon enough I obtained some result (For those of you who are wondering what kind of races I did I was a sprinter).

When I entered high school I was determined to qualify for the Italian championship. My times were good and the time required to qualify for the 400m (or quarter mile for the weirdos) was feasible(52.50 for a 15 y.o. ). I committed to my training religiously( and probably overtrained), I never EVER took a day off. I was determined and motivated. I needed to succeed at all costs. However, the week before the opening of the outdoor season I seriously injured my hamstring. Unfortunately I was not able to compete during that season. The pain was unbearable. I was frustrated, demotivated and discouraged. For a moment I thought I wanted to give up track and field forever.

Fortunately my coach managed to persuade me not to quit. So I started preparing for my next season. To make a long story short(even though it’s already long) I got injured again and could not compete.
Needless to say I was completely devastated. I didn’t know what to do I stopped going to the track and I also quit training. While I was on the sofa, playing youtube videos (back when there weren’t 6 different advertisements for each freaking video) I stumbled upon a video of Chris Heria doing a muscle up, the first thing that came to my mind was “F*ck I want to be like this guy”.

However, I was totally lost, I hadn’t the faintest idea how I had to begin. I didn’t know which exercises I needed to do, which routine I had to follow or how to structure my training sessions. 
That’s when I found this amazing community, it was really a blessing from heaven, the first thing I did was to read the FAQ. It is incredibly informative as well as clear and simple. At first I was a bit overwhelmed, I read it all in one go and probably understood only half of what was written. Nevertheless, after reading it multiple times everything became extremely clear. Subsequently I did my first workout. 

Fast forward six months, I bought a pull-up bar and started working my way up to this complex and difficult movement. Luckily, I already had a good base. In fact I could perform 2-3 chin ups. 
So I started doing 3x2 chin ups, I slowly but steadily progressed until I was able to do 5x6 chin ups.
From there I moved to normal pull-ups, then to weighted pull-ups. At this juncture, I began to develop my explosive strength by doing chest to bar pull ups and yesterday I finally achieved my first muscle up. 

I know this post may seem a bit stupid or maybe pointless to many of you but, as I have previously stated, I wanted someone with which I could share this new experience. And, more importantly, I needed someone that would have listened to my personal story. I never told this to any person I know, not even my parents, I had to talk about my past experiences with a person in order to vent some anger.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"This question is mainly aimed at overweight people who never worked out before and started with bwf and never picked up weights. Very specific but if you fit the criteria or are close to it please answer.

Basically did losing weight make it easier for you? How was the journey like? 

I have started going to a gym, not to lift weights but do my bodyweight stuff. I only do some cardio and then work on basics like pushup, rows, squats etc. I have some friends who have been going for some time. I tried doing some machine work with weights and could easily do the weight they were on. 

So yea weights and machine work looks and feels easy but I want to stick to bodyweight for now and master bodyweight basics.

"Hi guys,

I've been working out consistently for over a year and I feel like I plateaued a few months ago. I do a PPL split where I try to alternate (don't always end up doing it) between high volume/lower weight days and low vol/higher weight day. I'm 24, 5'7, M, BF is around 11-14% I think. Diet is fine for the most part, counted calories for a while but stopped recently, just cautious with some foods and I get enough protein in.

Also, I workout at home so I have limited equipment for the most part. I have 90lbs adjustable dumbells, squat rack with a pull bar, barbell with weights going up to 330lbs. Leg extension+hamstring curl machine and resistance bands.

My Pull day looks something like this:

Superset: 3 sets of barbell rows (125lbs) + 3 sets of shrugs (125lbs)

3 sets of dumbell rows (70lbs)

3-4 sets of wide grip pull ups, sometimes I add 3 more sets of close grip as well

3 sets of seated bicep curls (35lbs)

3 sets of seated hammer curls (35lbs)

3 sets of either preacher curls or chin ups

My Push day looks something like this:

4 sets of incline dumbell press (70 lbs)

4 sets of flat bench press (I sometimes alternate between dumbell press (75 lbs) or close grip barbell bench press (145lbs)

3 sets push ups

Superset: 3 sets skull crushers (25lbs) along with 3 sets chest flies (25lbs)

Superset: 3 sets tricep kickbacks (25lbs) + 3 sets dips

3 sets Shoulder press (55lbs)

Superset: 3 sets of lateral raise (20lbs) + 3 sets of bent over lateral raise (20lbs)

Legs:

4 sets barbell squats (320-330lbs)

3 sets of Romanian deadlifts (150 lbs)

Superset: 3 sets of leg extensions (85 lbs) + 3 sets leg curls (75 lbs)

3 sets of Bulgarian split squats (40 lbs)

3 sets of either pistol squats (75 lbs + resistance band) or 3 sets of jump squats (resistance band)

I sometimes do a 5 min leg workout that includes side lunges, donkey kicks, hip thrusts...

I'm trying to take it easy with my pull days since I recently injured my back so I'm trying to go low in weights until I feel comfortable. I'm really struggling in going up in weight for my push day especially since I work out alone at home and I don't have anyone to spot me most of the time. I made a lot of progress with legs but I don't really have more plates to go up in weight for squats (also I don't really want to do more than what I am doing right now since I feel like it is already high enough for my size). I try working out 6 days a week. I want to gain more muscle and lose a bit more belly fat so I'm just looking for advice on what I should change?

"Hi everyone. Skinny 29yo here.  
I have been doing the (old) RR for some years. I do a sedentary day job so I've mostly used the routine to keep in shape and stay healthy, and it has mostly accomplished the job in that regard, but in these years I have built almost 0 muscle and I would like to change that.   
I know most of you are gonna say ""eat more"". Believe me, I have tried. No matter what, this is something that my body or brain refused to do.

I know most of you are going to tell me to eat more and believe me, it's not for a lack of trying. No matter how hard I try, my body/brain won't allow me to.  
Is it still possible to build some muscle without a (great) caloric surplus? I have been thinking of adding dumbbells or a kettlebell to my routine (I don't have a lot of space in my apartment and couldn't afford a big training gear), would that help? Would I be better off switching to a different routine?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I was just watching one of my nutrition lectures, and I learned that for us to feel the sensation of being full and getting that 'satisfaction' after eating, leptin must be secreted for it to go to the hypothalamus and bind to the LEP-R receptors. Our body only then recognises this as 'yep that's enough food. We're good.'

I also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. This has the following implication: we need a rise in blood sugar, so that insulin can get released -> secrete a fair amount of leptin -> feel full. On this idea, my lecturer said that ""fats making us fuller"" comes across as a misunderstanding for the most part. Whilst it could keep you full ***after*** you feel the initial 'fullness', but to *actually feel full in the first place,* fats are actually counteractive. This is because fats slow the digestion rate of both proteins and carbs (ie. agents who are capable of spiking blood sugar) and delays insulin secretion, and therefore leptin secretion as well.

And this led onto an important point for those following LCHF/keto approach; for those who don't track their calories and only just 'listen to their body', having such high intake of fat + very limited rise in blood sugar levels, they could actually PUT ON WEIGHT because they have harder time feeling full after they eat!

This was the main takeaway from the lecture though. Any ideas/counterarguments/supporting arguments? I know this sub can be biased towards outshining the benefits whilst neglecting its downsides, but I always like to evaluate the validity of my sources - even reliable ones like university lectures imo.

"Hello guys, and a happy new year to everyone. 

So I’m just posting about help with mobility. Since I started Calisthenics, I’ve noticed I have very poor mobility, which has probably lead to some injuries. For example, I cannot for the life of me sit in deep squat due to poor ankle mobility. When I do the 5 inch wall test, my knee is probably about 2 inches away from touching the wall - basically need another 2inches of ankle mobility. In general I’m a stiff person, especially in my lower body. I play quite a bit of soccer, and I have noticed that I really struggle to hit high volleys (Zidane 2002 UCL final) cause of tight hips, and I really struggle with the L-sit cause of poor compression and possibly tight and weak hip flexors.

So I was wondering, are there any good mobility programs out there that you would recommend. I know there are channels like Tom Merrick on YouTube, but there is so much information out there that it’s a struggle to colate all of it and create a program that can help me. There’s even the kneesovertoes guy who’s program I’ve heard is good at helping people gain lower body mobility and strength.

All opinions/help is welcomed. And I hope you all have a great 2022 in regards to your fitness journey","bodybuilding, fitness"

I have a little pops\snaps in my brachialis while benching. The pain is around above 60% of 1RM, happens only during a specific range of motion(just when bar is about to touch the chest). 
I can feel something pop/snap in the brachialis which makes me loose my tightness the bar comes and rest on my chest for a brief second and the I can press it up from there.
The pain continues in a few accessories as well like weighted dips, weighted pull ups, OHP. Other than these the pain goes away I can’t feel anything while doing hammer or anything else.
This pain has made me stick on my bench and ohp for like an year now.

I have tried everything, spot rolling using a lacrosse ball, percussion machine etc.

"I'm a firm believer of ""mental sustainability"" for long-term success; so many people go through a ""beastmode"" phase of their lives where they hit the gym/workouts hard, to the max, then ultimately just burnout. Seeing an extended laundry list of movements in a routine is such a turnoff for me. Considering the large of muscles compound movements hit, I never felt it necessary to have such a long list. My own:

- **Chinups**:  Narrow-grip/hollowbody. I've completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. At the very last rep of a set, I hold at the very top to allow the biceps/core put in some extra work. Try it! They also build some pretty awesome abs. 

- **Dips**: Often with 35lbs between the legs. It's fun knowing that my pecs which I've been complimented on in a few occasions were built using my mom's plastic medical walker. It sits in my room since it takes up practically no space so I can crank out some reps on a complete whim; convenient, amazing.

- **Legs**: Got me here. I'm lazy in this department. Sometimes it's goblet squats, air squats, BSS. Finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here, in between my occasional hikes.

- **ETC**: Kettlebells. Walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so I'll occasionally do a few cleans/rows, whatever. Just some random spontaneous movements for functional strength building. 

That's pretty much it. Not the most exciting routine but it keeps me consistent for sure.","bodybuilding, fitness"

Hi all. As title, I've been using the H6 HRM for indoor HIIT sessions (via YT) for about a year and a half now. It's been excellent so far. Paired up with the ""MyWorkouts"" app on Android. Rock solid.

However, recently, I've been getting drop outs on the HR signal. Just intermittent (or at least I thought). I guessed it might be the battery so I changed that, still same issue (even tried another brand of battery, just in case).

Then I worked out what the issue was. The HR signal was dropping whenever I did an exercise facing down such as press-ups, mountain climbers, etc. The signal came back within a few seconds of getting upright again.

Quite odd, especially as it's been solid for the majority of the time I've had it. The strap is adjusted nicely, although I've also changed the strap length both shorter and longer. There's moisture between the strap and my chest too.

I've since tried using other apps and other devices but same issue.

I've emailed CooSpo but am cynical they can/will do anything given I've had it over a year. But still, has anyone else found this with their HRM, whether this one or another?","bodybuilding, fitness"
" Hi folks,

I’m a noob in fitness and I want to start working my way up in calisthenics. I’m sick and tired of searching this topic on Google as I get bombarded with ads there and following that on Facebook and Instagram. I have no experience, so I can’t really tell which program is good. 

Little bit about me. I’m 44, 6 feet and about 200 lbs. I consider myself on the beginning of the heavy side. I can run 2-3 miles with 5 mph on a treadmill and do not have any major injuries. I can’t really do any pull-ups and only 6-7 push-ups in a set. 

What is the systematic way to start building my core for calisthenics? I need an easy to follow daily, weekly, monthly regimen. I have watched lot of YouTube videos, but no one talks about getting started from zero when one can’t do a single pull-up. Most of them are from trainers who want to sell their programs. I’m not opposed to paying, but as I said earlier, I have no way to know if these programs are any good. A lot of people say they’re ripoffs.

## Why do reverse nordics in the first place?

Today's write-up and video is all about the reverse nordic curl, what it is, why you should be doing it and how to get your first one!

First of all, why should we even consider doing the reverse nordic at all? There's actually a very good reason for for it.

##Quadriceps Anatomy
Your quadriceps are comprised of four muscles, three of them, vastus medialis, intermedius and lateralis act exclusively to extend the knee - his is because the vastus group only cross the knee, a muscle that only crosses one joint is known as monoarticulate.

The fourth quad, rectus femoris, is biarticulate, or it crosses both the hip and the knee and acts to extend the leg as well as being one of the primary muscles involved in flexing the hip. Put simply, when the rec fem contracts, it is going to either flex your hip, or extend your knee. 

 Let's use the squat as an example, although this is true any time both our knee and hip are flexed: at the bottom position, to stand out of the squat, I need to contract my quads to extend my knee whilst simultaneously extending my hip to finish standing. But remember that the rectus femoris wants to actually flex the hip as it straightens the knee, and it creates a lot of hip flexion torque when it does this. 

We have a problem here: if my rectus femoris powerfully contracts from this position, it will straighten my knee, but at the same time it will try to pull my torso further forward into hip flexion, which is not how you stand up out of a squat!  To be able to stand up out of a squat, or a lunge without fighting our own muscles, our central nervous system has to get involved.

Our brain is smart, so what it's going to do is preferentially use the quads aren't going to pull our hip forward as they contract - so the workaround is the CNS preferentially recruits the three vastus quadriceps, because they only extend the knee, and do nothing at the hip. (

So the moral of the story is that squats,  lunges, leg presses and other exercises that require the quads to straighten the knee while the hip is flexed are great for training the the vastus group, but those movements do not create enough mechanical tension in the rectus femoris to induce hypertrophy. Or in other words, if your rec fem to grow, you need to train it directly .

Meatloaf once said 2/3 ain't bad, but in this case, working 3 out of 4 quads is bad - or at the very least you don't want to neglecting one of them Rectus femoris is large and powerful, and for complete leg development it can't be missed!

##So how do we train the rec fem specifically?

Well, in exercises that extend, or straighten the knee whilst the hip stays in extension, the rectus femoris is just as, if not more active than the vastus group. So to train the rectus femoris, we need a movement that extends the knee whilst our hip remains fixed in extension. The perfect exercise to achieve that is the reverse nordic curl. 

##Mobility considerations
But first, a checkpoint. Are you comfortable sitting in deep knee flexion under load? Are you free from any kind of knee pain? If yes, then the reverse nordic curl is for you!

The reverse nordic through its full range of motion is putting the knee through it's full range of knee flexion, so you need to be able to achieve that range of motion in the classic kneeling recfem stretch (shin flat on the wall, and upper back in contact with the wall) before you attempt to put your knee extensors under load at such an acute angle.

##How to perform a reverse nordic, and progressions.
To perform a reverse nordic curl begin kneeling on a padded surface. Squeeze your glutes and abs to brace your core and kneel tall so your body is in a straight line from your femur to the top of your head. From here, keeping your torso in a vertical position and hips extended, slowly lean backwards by bending at the knees. Lower yourself down into the movement gradually as far as you can comfortably control the movement, and return to the starting position by extending the knee.

Given that the further we lower into the movement, the more torque will be going through our knee joints and we will have to create more knee extension torque to raise ourselves back up.  This means the exercise will get harder the lower you go into it, so if you are unable to achieve full range in the reverse nordic curl, to lower the difficulty just reduce the range of motion until your strength increases.

 So that's the simplest way to progress towards the reverse nordic, just gradually increase the range of motion over time. Another benefit of doing it this way is that your flexibility will increase in tandem with your strength level.

Another way of progressing towards a full reverse nordic, is to do an assisted nordic, with either a band or a cable set up to assist you as you go down. The benefit of using a band is that the elastic force of the band increases in the same way as the torque at the knee does - meaning the lower you go into the movement, the higher the strength demands on your quads become, but the band is also helping more and more the deeper you go.  Using a cable machine does not have this accommodating elastic force, it is just a static force assisting you the same way throughout the entire movement. This isn't the worst thing though, because you can choose a resistance level that is sufficient to help you at the bottom, because you will only need that help at the bottom, the rest of the movement is easy, by comparison. Over time once you get stronger at the bottom position, you can decrease the amount of assistance and work twwards your full bodyweight reverse nordic. 

So there you go! That, my friends, is the reverse nordic curl!

"Hi all,

I've been trying to transition to more bodyweight workouts over the last 6 months. I've been doing 5x5 to build up a decent base for about 6 months before that, but I'm fairly weak in the shoulders and back due to an old lumbar injury. I can't do a single pull up unassisted but I can do 2 - 3 chin ups.

I came across this [https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pullup?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pullup?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

And I notice down the bottom the poster says either pullups or chinups will do. I just wanted to get some opinions on whether or not it would be a good idea for me to just focus on doing chin ups as a way to transition into pullups down the line? I'm thinking of doing them a minimum 3 times a week, aware of the fact that I don't want to injure myself.

Any feedback would be great.

"Male, 34yo, H:1,85m/6.07ft W:96.4Kg/212.5lb

I'm no stranger to the recommended routine. in fact I did it for about a year, and I was having good results, but what really put me off it is that with all the recommended breaks, i was clocking in more that 1h30m of exercises, which for me is a very very long time. 

also, lack of conditions to do some of the exercises (like nordic curls, because I don't have a heavy thing to shove my feet under) and some exercises i couldn't understand the progression (like single legged deadlifts and reverse hyperextensions that i did without ever breaking a sweat since the beginning, and couldn't progress for one reason or another). 

so eventually i dropped from it. also, moving out of my house didn't help me stick to it, or any other healthy routine. since then, i occasionally started doing a very reduced program with only:

* push ups (5x6), 
* ringed static dips (which i am horrible at lol, 5x10s), 
* negative pullups (5x10s slowly descending), and 
* rows (almost flat to the ground, 5x5)

the aim was having a very short routine. i decided to increase sets to decrease reps without decreasing total volume, but i couldn't really tell if it was an effective strategy.

but even with this short routine i ended up dropping it. maybe it's because it feels incomplete (because it is). but maybe it's because what I really want is increase cardio and flexibility, rather than counting reps and measuring muscles - or at least is the reason I give myself for chickening out of it, i dunno. i figured i should look for different kinds of progression, other than just counting reps.

so enough with the shrink chair crap. tl;dr: i want to change up my exercise routine to something different. here's the requirements:

* focus on cardio, flexibility and skills, especially core which of probably my weakest area.
* short contiguous duration (I'd rather exercise 2x15 minutes a day than one session of 30 minutes). 

any suggestions? i remember one time i seen someone recommending some kick-ass cardio channel on YouTube, but very unfortunately I didn't open the link to subscribe. i did a quick search here but i couldn't find it. i included skills in the mix because I figure doing cool tricks is going to keep me motivated.

restrictions: i live on a tiny 56m² apartment, and the only equipment that i have is a doorframe bar and some DIWhy gymnastic rings that I've made with PVC tubing and rope lol

also, if possible, recommend me some back exercises, i think my lower back wants to give up existing lol.

anyway, that's it. sorry for the long post. any help appreciated.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"As a skinny dude I've always wanted a chest. Despite that, my priorities in fitness are efficiency and convenience.

I started in bodyweight by doing some pushups throughout the day. Even after reaching high reps I noticed hardly any visible muscles. I tried diamonds and other variations in hand placement. The minor changes brought minor rewards. Decline pushups could help but the slight inversion, deltoid requirement, and variables in feet/hips/hand/head placement kills the fun without enough chest reward.

So, I bought some straps and tried flys only to quit early for a few reasons. Flys require straight arm strength to be effective while not necessarily helping to establish that strength. This means I would have to gain a capability that I don't quite value before I might be able to perform an isolated movement. Secondly, the ROM for flys is absurd compared to other movements such as a pushup. The arms can either spread beyond their working limit or they can narrow to a point of imbalance. Sure these are avoidable but again the cost is high for an isolated movement. Lastly, I see it as an ineffective attempt to replicate a gym machine so that more people buy straps.

Eventually I wandered into a gym routine and experimented with total body fitness. I decided to work on dips starting with bench, then bands at the dip station, then varied positioning at the station. Then I moved to the rings for support holds, then negatives, then my first few shaky red-faced ring dips.

With only a small volume those ring dips were grinding through my shoulders, so I started warming up with shoulder dislocates. Just like flys, the ROM was silly and the movement felt too isolated to be effective.
Everything changed when I started Skin the Cats. Versus shoulder dislocates I was getting a more effective warmup in a fraction of the time. If I focused on keeping my legs straight and slowing the movement then I would also get some chest pump, specifically when exiting the German Hang.

STC let me safely increase my ring dip volume. I was mainly seeing tricep and stabilizer activation but not enough chest.  I tried targeting my chest by ""leaning forward"" based on internet advice. However, I felt no real difference and my form was suffering. When I returned to strictly vertical form the depth in my range of motion began to increase. Beyond 5 reps at maximum depth (hands to armpits) my chest was finally getting pumped.
Based on my personal experience I think there is a common misunderstanding around the role of the pectorals. The lower pecs, larger than the upper, are used to move the elbows from behind the back to beside the ribs. Both STC and full-depth ring dips include this motion.

By only working the lower pecs I was effectively growing moobs. The space halfway between my collarbone and my nipple remained unfilled. I was still happy to have something but the longing for that complete chest persisted.

For some upcoming travel, I wanted a program that required less gear. Without my beloved rings I needed something for the upper body other than an excessive amount of gimmicky pushups.

I prefer bodyweight fitness for mobility and a habit that can be independent of weights. Without adding weight and without ROM limitations like ""wide"" variants, bodyweight progression requires unilateral movement. I already use split squats and archer rows, so what's the unilateral variant of a travel-friendly upper body compound exercise?

I started doing archer pushups and I feel the same mental leap that came with STC and ring dips. Archer pushups are difficult, compound, and they use a complete yet controlled ROM. They hit my triceps hard while also hitting some back and shoulders due to the side-to-side motion, which does not exist for other pushups. The additional activation is because I can push or pull myself from one side to the other, though I am still figuring out how to control whether the transition is more of a push or pull.

Focusing on that lateral motion makes it difficult for me to hold the proper plank form, causing a sag in the hips. I fixed this by piking slightly. I also learned to focus on pushing up and then over since a single push back to the center starting position caused more shoulder grind.

One tricky ""cost"" vs other pushups is a need to rotate the palms. The shifting weight already adds a more uncomfortable load to the heel of the hand that cannot be mitigated by using knuckles or finger tips. Padding can help with this but it should not add friction that impedes the palm rotation. I'll be experimenting with some minor gear like gloves or paralletes.

I'm also finding that a straight arm is more important than widening hand placement. Widening caused more failures without actually increasing intensity. Of course, there is a required minimum width somewhere outside the shoulders.

While I highly recommend archer pushups over any other pushup variant, I'm still searching for how to complete that upper chest. Thankfully, there is another unilateral pushup variant called typewriter pushups. These feel harder than archers due to the persisted isometric load on the upper body. There is no rest between reps because there is no locking out.

Typewriters seem even less documented than archers, so it's unclear how far above the floor I should keep my chest. It needs to be somewhere between nipple scrape and lockout. I'm still new to typewriters but so far it seems that the ideal height is exactly midway. Any lower and my shoulders start to grind. The lateral motion seems to be a shallow rainbow. 

After only a handful of typewriters in each set I can feel the upper chest activation that I've been searching for. Time will tell if I see the visual balance. For now, the feeling alone is exciting enough. I don't have any pics to share and hoping to see some moobs is a bit strange. Anyways, thank you for reading. I'd love to see more tips for bodyweight chest.

TLDR: ring deeps and unilateral pushups.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi Everyone, 

So as the title says I have some questions about rest days while trying to efficiently gain muscle mass. How often should I have a rest day? Where should they be in my weekly routine? What level of activity can I still do on a rest day? Onto the details: 

I’m 30 years old, 177.8cm (5’10), and currently 78kg (172lbs). I think I’m around 9% body fat (I test w/ calipers but know it’s not a perfect science). 

My goal currently is to gain muscle mass in my back, shoulders, and arms. While not putting on any more total weight than necessary. I understand that I’ll be gaining weight during this time, but I don’t want to inefficiently just put on as much weight as possible.  

I have a desk job so my workouts are really the only source of activity through the day. I focus primarily on bodyweight exercises with a bit of light weights worked in. I’m working to increase back strength and have been focusing a lot on pullup variations this past year. Trying to work my way to clean unassisted muscle-ups. 

I eat around 2,000 – 2,100 calories a day with about 180 grams of protein. I know these calories seem low, but I do slowly gain weight at this amount. Maybe about 0.75-1.0 lbs (0.50kg) a week. Should I be trying to gain more weight weekly? For reference, when I was cutting weight, I was around 1,800 calories. I think I just have a very slow metabolism? Is that amount of protein enough? 

**My biggest question is how many rest days I should I have during the week to efficiently gain muscle? And on those rest days can I do any sort of activity? If I do a small ab workout and a work on some calisthenic progressions is this ok? Or should I truly not be working out at all that day to let my muscles rest?** 

For example, on my Wednesday below my Apple watch says my total active calories for the day is only around 650 which seems very low. As a comparison my Monday/Tuesday are around 1000 active calories for the day. 

My detailed routine is below: 

Monday Pull: Assisted Muscle-ups w/ band (sets of 3), Pull-ups (3 sets of 8-12), Light Deadlifts 75-80% of my body weight, Ring Rows (3 sets of 10-12), Chin-ups (3 sets of 6), Lat pull-ups, other light BW exercises to end the workout

Tuesday Push: Handstand Push-ups (3 sets of 12-15 against wall), Gymnastic Ring Dips (3 sets of 12-15), Dumbbell Bench (3 sets of 12-15 at 50-55lbs), Medicine ball push-ups (3 sets of 12), Ring Push-ups (3 sets of 12), Regular Dips (3 sets of 6-10), Archer Push-ups (3 sets of 8 on gymnastic rings) 

Wednesday Rest: 15-18 minutes of Abs (Plank, hollow hold, etc) and work on some calisthenic progressions – Tucked Planche, Crane Pose, L-Sit

Thursday Legs: 10min Bike Ride, Light Front Squat (45-65lbs), Lunges w/ 25lb kettlebells, Split Squat w 25lb kettlebells, assisted 1 leg squat, Lunges w body weight

Friday Pull: Same as Monday but w/o deadlifts. Just body weight exercises. 

Saturday Push: Same as Tuesday

Sunday Rest: Calisthenic exercises (Tucked Planche, Crane pose, L-sit), 2-3 mile run at 8:30-9:00 minute mile pace. 

Apologies for what has turned into a long post. However, I would really appreciate any feedback on my routine and the details I’ve provided.

"I want to buy a weighted vest for bodyweight training because I need to spend my money quick as the inflation is really high in my country now and it's increasing. I'm thinking that some time in my life I'm gonna buy a weight vest anyway eventually so might as well buy it when the prices are cheaper. 

I was astounded when I saw how light most vests are. I'm 67kg and I can do about 12 dips, for example. I put about ~10kg of weight in a backpack and I did 8 dips. This is still out of the strength range and into the hypertrophy range and I want to also do sets in the 1-5 reps range in most movements and I will also get stronger and stronger in the future. Yet articles say that vests should not exceed 10% of your weight??? (6 kg in my case?)

And then you have movements like push-ups. I can do 33 normal pushups. I don't even know how much weight I'd need to put on so that my max pushup would become 5, and that's only now. Sure, you can progress horizontal push easier without weight but maybe you want to do something that stimulates the chest more without putting the load more on the shoulders (PPPUs) or triceps (diamonds) or without making it unilateral (archer/one-arm) or maybe I will simply like the movement more in the future because of its simplicity.

Am I overthinking this or underestimating how hard exercises get once you add more and more weight? I can't find a vest more than 30kg in my country that's not incredibly expensive and even those are hard to find.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey,

I've been training handstands for over a year now and have achieved a 30s+ hold, a multitude of shapes and even some one arm leans. That's great and I love that I can do these kind of things now.

But! There's a catch (at least that's how I view it). I have good and bad days. On good days, I am able to do all the aforementioned skills during my handstand sessions. The bad thing is that most of my days are bad days. These are days where I struggle to even get a clean kick up and stay there for 5-10s. On these days, I mostly focus on wall drills, such as B2W and C2W rebalancing drills, but I feel like this isn't sufficient for my handstand practice.

Enough blabbering, my question(s) is as following: How should I structure my practice sessions on bad days? Should I try kicking up, repeatedly, even if I fail a lot? Continue with wall drills? Also, what do you guys suggest for how to construct a more structured handstand routine? I feel like having a structured plan is better than winging it and doing cool stuff on my hands.

" Ten minutes ago, I started doing my leg workout. I finished the first set, took a break, and went to do the second set.

I was doing pistol squats on my left leg when my brain had too much of it. I lowered myself for the 5th rep, said: ""Fuck it"", and quit.

I didn't quit because my muscles were burning or hit failure. I gave up because I was tired psychologically. 

For the past two weeks, my rapid progress in all of my leg exercises has finally stopped. I couldn't progressively overload myself for four leg workouts in a row (I do PPL split). 

You have no idea how much dread and fear I experience before the leg day. I'm afraid of the pain I'm going to suffer. I'm scared of the discomfort and occasional burning feeling in my muscles. *What if I regress and fail to complete the prescribed amount of repetitions?*

I waste my evening trying to find a solution to this issue, to discover someone who has had the same problem and fixed it. 

Additionally, I've been seriously considering taking an entire week off training. The last time I did that that was one year ago for legs and six months ago for arms. 

If I don't make my training more enjoyable, I risk quitting all of this altogether. Can you help me? Would it be the right thing to take a small break? Do you perceive the same emotions as I do before a gruelling workout?

"Howdy, 

First time posting here.

So, I am 30M. Started working out 6 months ago. I see good progress as I am trying to recomp since I am fat. I went from 135kg to 115kg since the start of the year and my muscles have increased significantly (because I didn't use them in the past 10 yrs). The physical things I do are going to the gym, the store, and the cardio on a bike that I do in the morning. The rest of the time I sit in front of my computer, press buttons, and stare at the screen to make my boss happy so he gives me money for whey. So that said I think I have a good amount of energy I can spend in the gym so I've developed this split which I started in December:  


Day 1: Chest & Triceps + Some Abs

Day 2: Back & Biceps  
Day 3: Shoulders & Legs

Day 4: Triceps & Biceps + Abs  
Day 5: Chest & Back 

Day 6: Legs & Shoulders 

Day 7: Chill

I get up in the morning and do 30-40 minutes of cardio trying to keep my pulse 126 because (210 - 30)x0.7 to burn fat but not muscle.

I do around 4 exercises with 4 sets of between 8-12 reps for each group for the day. It takes me around 90 minutes with 1min+ rest between sets.   


My feeding is intermittent fasting. Usually:  


The morning after cardio: 1-2 whole eggs, 3-4 whites. 1 cup of oatmeals with 1 scoop of whey  
The afternoon after workout: 1 scoop of whey with greek yogurt, 1 banana, and a couple of rice cakes (sometimes with peanut butter)  
Late afternoon: Meat (pork, chicken, or sausage), veggies (salad), and some keto dessert the wife made. 

  
I need constructive criticism because everything I listed is based on only my learnings and thoughts.

I don't have friends around and especially no gym bros to talk fitness so your input will be valuable to me.

Is it with food? If so, there is a lot of powders and stuff but I know that some just don’t work, which would I stay away from which should I use now etc? 
Also what foods should I eat // avoid

Does it start with weights? I have weights but I tried one time but I didn’t notice a difference I think I was doing something wrong. 

How long before I will start to notice improvements? (Even if it’s just very little by little)

Notice: I have my own gym with pretty much everything you could think of besides a pull-up bar. (I have something kinda similar but it’s a machine you sit on and pull up -idk the name) 

What machines should I use / avoid 

NOTICE: it would be great to look amazing and ripped but in general I just want my body to start slowly looking better and I want to feel more healthy 

Edit: Also, is it better to do more weight and less reps or less weight and more reps? /// Aka more reps or more weight? 

Any and all information is very helpful thank you again!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"It’s been about 5 months since I started training with my bodyweight and since this post is about my abs and core strength, I’m gonna focus on that. Just to give a little background: Starting out I could barely do leg raises and I couldn’t hold my lower back to the ground (initiating pelvic tilt). HOWEVER, I’ve improved a lot since then and I haven’t really felt the need to max out on leg raises on the ground as I do them hanging or on parallel bars. The problem is, I never really feel like my lower abs are working as hard as my upper, for example, after a 30s L-sit I will feel my upper abs “burning” and being much harder but feeling nearly nothing in my lower. I think this is probably related to genetics and that my body might store more fat in my lower abdomen since they also differ in definition. Any advice?

"is it true that every routine should have a vertical and horizontal push and a vertical and horizontal push? is it okay to revolve my push and pull around pike push-ups and push-ups then add accessory works that i want? then for pull around chin-ups and body rows and extra accessory works? 

as someone who’s 8 months into training i want to revolve my routines around 2-3 compounds then choose 1-2 isolations. or am i too early for accessory works and should focus on mastering the compounds first?

Pistol squat progression

"Hello!

I am looking for recommendations on adjusting my training routine for things that I do not target. My current goal is to burn fat and make my weight the same-ish but with more muscles.

I am AMAB (she/her, not on hrt), 25 years old, current weight and height are 78 kg/178 cm. I've been practicing yoga for 14 years, several dance styles and physical theatre for 11; I've also had experience with martial arts but stopped due to lack of interest.

My current schedule is power, dynamic and static yoga for 1 hour 4 mornings a week, 2 hours 3 mornings a week, 1 hour every evening + any classes I teach (depends on the week). I do 1 hour of cardio 4 days a week, 30 to 60 minutes of dance (contemporary dance, ballet and freestyle) 4 days a week. Most of other time I sit behind the piano or jump around the classroom teaching voice and singing, mixing it with lighter yoga.

Strength and flexibility are quite okay, stamina and endurance are good, form is fine. I study in Iyengar and Viniyoga traditions which work with precision, structure, form and breath; both static and dynamic stuff is involved. I find lifting incredible boring but lift my piano from time to time when setting up in different rooms.

There's a pull up bar in my flat but it may be too close to the ceiling, about 30 cm from it (no way of moving it lower); I can bend my knees and pull up to mid-ribcage area. No weights, lots of yoga props, a stable metal yoga chair (a very heavy thing we use for shoulder thanks and stuff) than I can probably utilise for some reverse pushups (I also used it as barre for a while).

My diet is vegetarian and I have Crohn's Disease with a very long remission. I cannot eat high protein or high fat. I eat buckwheat, rice and pasta often + some additional grains, daily eggs, cheese often. Raw fruit is a must for lunches and I get fiber through greens when it's okay. Nuts and seeds are a problem, so they are very limited. Beans and lentils I eat less of. I due to the disease I also have a little bit of supplements that are easily digestible every morning; lots of vitamins, minerals, proteins (includes whey powder).


Sooooo. Any ideas?

Thank you! <3 <3 <3

Equipment I have at home:

Adjustable dumbbells that go up to 12 kg. Each plate on the dumbbell can come off and weights 1.5-2.5 kg. I also have one metal dumbbell that weights 25 pounds. 

Dip and pull up station.

Resistance band for assisted dips or pull ups (although I don't use it much but I felt if it helps with the form then why not). 

Might soon also purchases a weighted vest.

"Hi all,
I’ve been training calisthenics for about 8 months now, around 6 on some version of the RR (currently doing upper/lower split so I can do more leg volume, but I still generally do 3 on each a week). I’ve been working pistol squats for about a month now and I’m noticing a pretty significant strength imbalance between my two legs on these. 

For example, I can do 5-6 unassisted (or maybe very light assistance towards the end) on my left leg. On my right, I can do maybe one unassisted on the first set but pretty much all subsequent reps/sets, I need at least a partial assist to get back up from the bottom.

I’m not sure if it’s a mobility/ankle strength issue maybe, although I am able to hit full range of motion on both legs even if I can’t get up from it unassisted on the right. I don’t think flexibility is a huge issue though—I’ve always been quite flexible.

Any help/suggestions are much appreciated, thank you!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"[Scapula kinematics of pull-up techniques: Avoiding impingement risk with training changes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4916995/)



Very interesting. I've always known (and perhaps everyone here) that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. What got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pull-ups. I was under the (wrong) impression that the external rotation from the chin-up created more space in the shoulder complex, thereby reducing the chances of shoulder impingement. I was wrong. Regular pull ups might be the way to go for anyone with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. How about neutral grip pull ups?

**TLDR:**  *High arm elevation during pull-ups reduces sub-acromial space and increases pressure, increasing the risk of impingement injury. Wide and reverse pull-ups demonstrate kinematics patterns linked with increased impingement risk.*","bodybuilding, fitness"

"\[absolute beginner here\]

Situation: I can do one set (8 reps) of body rows with my legs straight. And then I take a 2 min break - and try to do the 2nd set but cant go beyond 5-6. Subsequent sets are worse and I try to get to 8 reps each set by bending my legs and reducing the length of my outstretched body.

I've been stuck at this for about 6 weeks now - but I know I've progressed in some other aspects (like I can 2 band assisted pull ups with proper form, previously I couldnt do even one)

Is there a way to understand if this is normal? Am I being impatient? Maybe I am, but I dont have much of a reference point on how slow/fast progressions should be.

"So recently, for the first time, I saw someone (with my own eyes) do a two finger planche! This completely blew me away. It’s one thing to see such things on Instagram (which is still rare) but seeing it in person was something else.

It got me so hyped and motivated. I know I’m really far away from that but I was wondering, what is the best way to strengthen your fingers for such things?

I tried push-ups on my fingers and managed to do a few reps on 3 fingers but that was kinda painful. I need to harden my fingers somehow I guess. But at the same time I’m afraid of injuring myself, so I wanna start slowly.

As for the planche, I’m currently learning the straddle planche and it will take a while to even do that properly. But I wanna start at least doing maybe two finger push ups soon.

Any advice or experience appreciated!

"Bonjour mes amis:

Pretty straightforward question here. I bough some rings and did the RR on them until i could no longer advance more or the exercises started to get a little too creative for my taste (or plainly too hard). Im currently trying BodyByRings routine by FitnessFAQs but i think its not what im looking for: its just pure hypertrophy. Its okay, but not what im into right now.

My target is to learn ring skills: some, normal skills but just on rings: M-Up; L-Sit; proper straight-legged skin the cat; levers, and eventually (not even in the horizon here), the planche.

But i discovered the rings have their own skills and i want to learn them too: shoulder stands, forward roll, iron cross (yeah, i know), among others.

Sounds to me like more ""proper"" ring workout than doing ""normal"" exercises but on rings.

&#x200B;

Where can i find progressions in order to learn those skills ? Are there any routines that that target them ?

Hey friends. Long time lurker here and first time poster. I recently just started lifting again (3 months ago) after a 3 year break and started cutting. Halfway through I realized I wasn't dying and just continued to cut until a DEXA scanned 5% BF  (12ish week prep). Since I didn't do a show and I don't really see a point to getting even lower than this I decided to call it. No where to really show off my hard work but I'm proud of what I've done.

"TaoPhysique is the only channel where I saw this exercise mentioned: [deep ring pushups](https://youtu.be/bZU7KlE-TV0?t=295).

He claims that it trains your whole upper body, which makes sense since it combines a pushup with a bicep curl, especially if you go deeper than him in the video, to the point where your arms are straight and then you curl them back. 

But does this hit your back well enough? Is there an upper muscle that's not hit well enough  by this but is usually hit well in a routine? Could someone do 20 sets of this in a week and no upper body exercise instead of doing 20 sets of push and 20 sets of pull, assuming the aim is hypertrophy and strength? For example, could the strength from this movement alone transfer well enough to other exercises like pull-ups, dips, handstand pushups, planche, etc. ? I'm starting to notice I train less and less due to time and motivation issues so cutting back a third of the sets in a week could be really great.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm on vacation right now, and I keep eating where ever we go, but all I have is my body because I don't have anywhere to hang my rings.  And I'm officially bulking for a few days only because I will not say no to food.

Insert isometrics.  I know by itself it can make you strong and grow muscle if you repeat the effort of 3-10 seconds on different positions. I.e. pull ups or pulls/push ups or dips or pike or handstand/ squats and it's variations.

So I decided to try it out.

So I'd do first 15 s of each major body part.  Squats resting on the wall, you can do a horse stance, then pull ups or rows, hanging making sure to squeeze the late and back and any other body part you want done, then on dips/push ups or pike or variations, you hold the position without locking out. 90° thing.

By doing this, you get an easy body weight strength training.  And you can do it in a circuit.

After one circuit of this, I do burpees of 15s.

I then do these two circuits repeatedly.

Takes around 10-15 minutes a day.  Very fun and quick.

Be sure to use stable and strong immovables so you don't destroy stuff as you travel.

"Hi Fellow Bodyweighters,

Lots of awesome info and threads on this sub. I started doing the RR a month ago and already feel a lot more mobile and limber thanks to some of the warmups and the workout itself. However, I have started feeling some shoulder pain starting around week 4 so I'm taking a week or so off to give the shoulders a break and let them hopefully heal.

For a smidge of background, I'm a 32YO male and more prone to injury than I was before before 30. Typically when doing the RR I've been looking to go for that extra rep every workout so I'm thinking that this combined with volume of hitting the same muscles 3 times a week (an increase for me) contributed to my shoulder issues. I read some stuff on this sub based around the concept of going for cautiously incremental gains and basically taking it easy on the intensity/volume because connective tissues take a lot longer to adapt and heal than muscle. 

To avoid injury in the future with the RR, what are this sub's thoughts on voluntarily increasing reps only every week for example instead of every workout in the spirit of taking it easy on the joints/tendons? So even if I can increase reps on a certain exercise in the same week, I would wait until the next week. Has anyone had experience with doing something like this?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So my wife and i had our first child last June. Before then, we have always been avid fitness people, working out 4-5/week. When Covid hit, we moved to BWF and followed the RR. We saw some amazing results from it and i fell in love with this style of working out. 

A year and a half later since starting the RR, our baby finally came and I thought it would be an awesome time for a break. The plan was to take a month off and then get back at it. Well, as the old saying goes, ""the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray"". The first month came and went, then 2, then 4, then now finally 6. 

Before the baby, I honestly can't remember the last time i went even a week without working out in some way and I definitely feel it. But trying to manage the balance of a kid and working out is.... challenging. Aside from the fact i feel demotivated because i feel I lost alot of progress in that time.

Anyway, i'm thinking about starting a split routine for easing back in and time constraints. Probably the OG split routine (upper and lower).

I guess i'm looking for encouragement, motivation, and advice on how best to get back to doing something that i love.

"Does anyone else seem to fall in the middle category of able to do at least 10 pull ups yet unable to maintain that number of reps for several sets?

I know people recommend weighted training to increase reps, and that is one option I have been trying. Ideally, I get to the point where cranking out 10 good pull ups exerts a similar amount of exhaustion as performing 20  pushups - not really anywhere near failure, but a large pump from all the volume.

Does anyone have any specific routines I could follow at this level to increase reps? I find gtg to be a bit too unstructured for myself, and perhaps not even beneficial at the rep range I am at.

"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. If not, can someone point me to the right place?  


For example, is it possible to increase the max number of pushups (or pullups) I can do in a row without gaining muscle or at least minimizing muscle growth? I know this is a strange question since most want to increase muscle size, but I do not. I want to increase strength and endurance without the bulk.  


I'm new to fitness, but I heard that people that train for strength do low reps with the hardest progression or heaviest weight. They want to do exercises in a way that focuses on the connection between the muscles and the nervous system.  I also read that being sore will lead to muscle growth. So, in order to prevent muscle growth, I would have to take long rests in between sets?  


How would I go about this if I wanted to increase my max reps for a single set without the added muscle? For example, if I could do 2 pull-ups, would doing strength training like doing harder variations or adding weight, would that lead me to be able to do more regular pull-ups? Then rest and do as many regular pullups (or a variation easier than the hardest I would be at), Then rest and go back to the strength training. Then continue the cycle of alternating between strength training, doing low reps with the hardest progression or heaviest weight, and endurance training, doing as many regular pull-ups as I can in a row until I fatigue. Also for the endurance part, could I do variations harder than the regular pull-up but easier than the hardest variation I'm currently at.  For example, let's suppose at some point I am able to do a one-arm pull-up, hypothetically speaking of course. For the endurance part, could I do as many archer pull-ups as I can in a row until fatigued instead of just the regular pull-ups? Similarly, could I add weight, but less than the maximum weight I am able to do? So, instead of just doing regular pull-ups in a row until fatigued, I do regular pull-ups with weight added. If my max weight for like 2 reps is 40 pounds. Could I do regular pull-ups with 20 pounds of weight added until fatigued?  


Would the alternating between the strength and endurance (up to fatigue and not failure) training help me to accomplish my goal of increasing strength and endurance without the bulk? Could I use a similar method for other bodyweight exercises?  


I'm not sure how much sense any of my ideas make or how plausible they are. I'd appreciate any advice or help. Thanks in advance to anyone that responds.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello,

Happy New Year, Best wishes to all !!

I recently got my first gym rings, but I've been uncomfortable using them because of the width of the strap cable. I spend most time being concerned about the cables breaking then working out,
but this is more a confidence issue then a defective product.  

It comes with the regular sized stability strap (around 1 inch wide), so I guess if the rings comes with them, they should be reliable enough for a beginner around 200lb.

I have a pair of ratchet strap 2 inch wide, which is obviously more heavy duty, but will it work if I use them instead?

I know it's a more ""it's in your head"" concern, but will the width of the cable affect the ring in any negative ways?

"First of all, I'm aware that you can't spot reduce fat. (e.g. You cannot lose 5kg in your thighs without affecting the rest of your body). You lose weight evenly trough out the whole body. So with knowing that, what would the result of the experiment be? 

For example will pullups get easier because of my chicken legs? Or will they get more difficult because of the missing muscle? And yes, I know that the only real way to lose 5kg off of my legs is through tons of cardio. But I'm ready man! My goal is to just have explosive pull and push power for muscle ups. All kinds of them - standard, reverse grip, clapping, wide, close grip. I'm in love with the movement.

*  Should I try to include pike pushup or dumbell overhead press in the workout?
* Am I missing any obvious muscle groups?
* How come I cant bench my bw, but I can do controlled full rom one armed pushups for reps?
* Does the training plan look sustainable?","bodybuilding, fitness"

"**Liam’s Ultimate Weighted Pull-Up Guide**

*Some random thoughts before I get into this:*

**Created this because I don't see a lot on prehab stuff as well as those little muscles that need work. IMO this routine is the best. It's not too intense and if you are pushing yourself, with good form, you will see results with minimal injury. This is like my first post ever so idk be nice or just be constructive if you can.** 

Shoutout to Kinobody for the actual routine. Gotta denounce the uber masculine chick magnet rhetoric he employs but it’s a great routine 

**Quick notes on form, pull with back for a majority of the movment. If you think you are retracting your back enough, you’re not, work on those arch hangs. You’re teres major and minor, rear delt, lats, and to some extent traps will benefit greatly. Long term, you'll want to stay away from straight bars but for warming up and doing hangs they are fine. The rings allow for you elbows to move naturally, and the neutral grip is the next best thing. I prefer hammer grip above all because it doesn't take forever to set up rings. I think going to dead hang is important, but with a bunch of weight around you, a complete dead hang might cause some tearing if you are just dropping into it, so make sure your rep is controlled on the neg! You will want to be as explosive as possible on the concentric pull part of the movement.**

**Keep it simple with the shoulder warmup stuff, people can do to much of the band work, and I have found that working on Australian pullups and proper posture throughout you day is key.**

**I consider this bodyweight hybrid exercising and feel this community can benefit from this guide, so that's why it's here. I'll edit it over time as I look at it more, but would love to hear thoughts and objections.**

**I can't emphasize enough to stretch the external rotator part of your rotator cuff as well as internal.**

**Before all else… prehab, aka prehabilitation—try to complete these exercises throughout the week. It doesn’t have to be before you’re actual workout. **

With any vertical focused pull exercise, your horizontal pulling muscles will need to be in check so as to ward off any injuries and encourage correct form, especially in retracting the scapula. Here are some crucial exercises for building rear delts and scapula strength: 

1. Band rows (watch[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5l0wcEOq1E) at x2 speed)
2. Australian pull-ups (watch[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nn7X16rDG8&amp;amp;t=74s) at x2 speed––also retract the scapula at the bottom more dramatically than he does)
3. Externally rotated rear delt rows. Theres a great athlean x vid I'm going to find for this.  
4. Maintaining good posture throughout the day by focusing on those little mid back muscles being your shoulders back. So I’m emphasizing here not to just pull you shoulders back by your elbows and arch your back, but to engage the muscles in your back to pull everything. There is a difference. 

*You should be able to comfortably rep out sets of 8-10 pullups before starting with weight* 

**Now onto the big stuff: stretching and rolling.** 

1. Get a lacrosse ball. Place it on your upper pec and lean on the ball against a wall. I don't care who you are, these muscles are tight and need to be loosened so you can actually keep your shoulders back and allow for space in your shoulder socket so it can move properly without pinching any tendons. ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFkEpwlV8nY) are some great exercises for opening that chest up as well) 
2. Roll out those rear delt and mid back and work your way up to rolling out your lats with a[ rumble roller](https://www.amazon.com/RumbleRoller-Textured-Muscles-Therapist-Technology/dp/B0711JJMBH/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=rumble+roller&amp;amp;qid=1638143770&amp;amp;qsid=146-0725227-4245905&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;sres=B01K078LZ8%2CB00ECASXAS%2CB07B4XGCX9%2CB0711JJMBH%2CB00ECB6UBQ%2CB0716Q348W%2CB016NE9A2A%2CB08FBJKXJH%2CB07VHGGGRH%2CB07B1HMDT3%2CB07GFGNDBW%2CB07G2YYBCB%2CB07HM9DRDZ%2CB006GUC9KC%2CB07GG2X4X5%2CB07KFD7KLP%2CB07GQHQP4T%2CB019F42TBY%2CB07Q8D4L61%2CB00XM2MRGI&amp;amp;srpt=MUSCLE_ROLLER) (there should be a cheaper smaller version somewhere too) as they can both get tight 
3. Sleeper stretch (watch[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yRiOeVvIM))
4. Posterior rotator cuff (external rotator cuff) stretches (watch[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoiGpT4PJ8))

**Let’s get into the workout, with a few rules going into the form** 

1. Use a neutral grip or rings. Never use a straight pullup bar for weighted pullups. It might work for some to use a bar but why risk the elbow problems. 
2. Warm up before every workout for at least 10 min. AT THE LEAST. This includes but is not limited to:    
   1. Jumping rope/jumping jacks to get blood flowing 
   2. Big circles with the shoulder going slowly and turning thumbs out (external rotation always). Your shoulders should be brushing your ears. Think big backstroke. This is so crucial. Getting fluid into the socket will stop all of that popping and make sure everything is well oiled and moving like it's supposed to.
   3. Bar hangs! At least 2 total min. This warms everything up and gets those muscles working how they should be.
   4. Swinging on bar gently side to side after bar hangs. Really focus on activating the lats as we usually put too much of the load on our arms. You want the load to be shared equally between arms and back.
   5. One armed hangs, stabilizing these by holding onto something lightly like a doorframe. You don't want to be twisting uncontrollably 
   6. Scapular retractions/arch hangs. Arch hangs are this ( link[ here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C995b3KLXS4)) These are hard so workout up to them with increasingly extreme scapula depression

**Alright now for the workout:** 

You will be doing 5 sets total. The first two will be warm up sets. The preceding three will go as follows. (rest at least 4-5 min between these sets). A quick note on the position of the weight itself, a weight belt is best, but in a pinch, a dumbell between the thighs works too. I like to have the weight in front of my pelvis so i get an abb workout 

* The first set consists of four reps with the last rep being as near failure as possible. So, the heaviest weight you can pull for four clean reps. 
* The next set will be 6 reps with the heaviest weight you can pull for clean reps. 
* The last set will be for 8 reps with the heaviest weights you can pull for 8 clean reps. 
   * *I find that decreasing by 20-25 lb for each set (80 for 4 reps, 60 for 6, and 40 for 8) is the easiest way to find your ideal set weight.* 

**Now the warmup sets:** 

* The first is 5 bodyweight reps 
* Rest for at least three min (this is vital) 
* The next is 50% the weight of your 4 rep set (your heaviest weight) but for 3 reps. 
* Rest at least 5 min. Keep those shoulders warm with those big circles. 
* Now refer to the above workout that you are now warmed up for!

Rest at least 48 hours before attempting again. Try to do this at least 2 times a week tho, but as much as 4. On the off days, try to stretch those lats out with bar hangs, esp one handed, this also helps creat space in your shoulder joint by stretching tendons. DO AUSTRALIAN PULLUPS AND REAR DELT WORK. Arch hangs are great in a pinch 

Bonus: scapula training

Put at least a plate around your waist and practice that scapula depression and retraction for 10+ reps. Eventually start training it like you would the pullup

Eat at least 120 g of protein daily and eat at least 30 g of protein plus 60 g of carbs within 30-45 min of completing the workout. In a pinch, a can of pinto beans is great. Oh, and you must sleep at least 8hrs to get  full benefits. ","bodybuilding, fitness"
"It was really frustrating last night to wait so long for the men to come out, and when the Open prejudging finally happened (~4 hours after the show began...) it felt rushed. We didn't get many call outs and comparisons. 

All of this could be avoided if the women's divisions were placed in a different time-slot. The Open division shouldn't suffer because of these extremely niche womens divisions. I'm sorry but I will never be interested in them and I think forcing the viewer to sit through hyper masculine women divisions is bad for bodybuilding.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello!  
\[she/her/hers\]  


So, since my last post I've had a lot of progress with my routine. I even got some equipment because apparently I love strength training and even a little bit of weights. Feels very grounding + I can listen to lectures during working out. Plus, this girl can now scare catcallers away by just flexing, haha.

I switched my routine twice (well, mostly rearranged what I do) and figured that yes, now that I have the equipment, I can do 3 days of RR a week + some changes due to my lifestyle.

I wanted to hear some opinions on how my routine looks, if someone has the time and energy for it, please.

Basically, it's 3 RR pairs, after which I change the core work and add some skill and counter-work afterwards. The set to reps ration is the usual. I focus more on the breath, form and countering, control vs speed, no bursts. Additionally, I do points 1-7 w/ ankle and wrist weights (1 kg each) to remind myself about better form, control, and alignment instead of dropping everything.  


1. First Pair of RR
2. Second Pair of RR
3. Third Pair of RR
4. Core work (w/ stabilisation focus):  
Paripurna Navasana 30-60 sec  
Ardha Navasana 30-60 sec  
(these are static core holds in different shapes; can easily look them up)  
Hanging leg raises
5. Arm raises w/ dumbbell:   
Frontal raises  
Lateral raises  
(different rotation of the arm based on the week; one arm at a time w/ stabilisation; currently 6 kg)
6. Side forearm plank:   
Arm raises (from waist to ceiling and overhead on exhale to lenghten, back on inhale)  
Leg raises (upper arm lengthened to the ceiling)
7. Extension work (Shalabhasana; I think you call them backbend arches or similar?):   
Arm and head raises on inhale  
Leg raises on exhale  
Diagonal arm/leg extention and raise on inhale w/ head changing which side it faces.
8. Inversions (once each):   
Handstand 1-3 min  
Headstand (supported and countered) 3 min w/ 2 variations, each 1 min  
Bound supported shoulderstand for countering, 3 min
9. Other countering as needed and rest.

This takes me about two hours (a little more depending on the day) to complete, and I feel just wonderful and energized for the whole day. Points 5-9 really make it a relaxing time for me after a workout, and I've never felt as good in my yoga practice. Everything feels more complete and connected now.

"So I was talking to my brother about how I can do 12 pull-ups in a row with good form and he was telling me it doesn’t count since I have to go down to a hang then back up. I honestly feel like that’s bs but it is a challenge I’m ready to achieve. If you can just tell me your thoughts on this I’d really appreciate it.

I google it up and these are the definitions for both of them, pull-up/ “an exercise involving raising oneself with one's arms by pulling up against a horizontal bar fixed above one's head.” Full range pull-up/ “When you do pull ups you should always aim for a full range of motion. Do not only use the upper or lower part of the movement and go into full extension of your arms at the bottom but on the contrary you keep your shoulderblades pulled down.”","bodybuilding, fitness"

My question is why is it way easier to do pull ups with regular grip [not the neutral, chin up grip] when I hold it closer/narrower. When I try to hold it to the edge (curved side of the regular grip) it gets infinitely difficult given and feels like my frame is not meant for it. Will I be able to do the curved grip ones in the future with normal training and and are these type of pullups considered the standard?","bodybuilding, fitness"
So I learned to lift like 6 years ago on my highschool football team and by now have a pretty good grasp on how and when to do exercises and such however my coaches failed to really teach us how to do proper warmups and stretches and things that help your body not fall apart. Now as I get older (I’m only 22 but after 4 years in the marines I may as well be 42) I’m seeing a need to learn these things so I don’t have to live off of pain killers the rest of my life. So that being said any recommendations for warmups and stretches to do before/ after a workout or just before bed/ when waking up? If anyone knows any good YouTube videos they can link or if someone’s an expert and can explain them to me I’d appreciate. As always thanks guys.,"bodybuilding, fitness"

"How I define is a person fades or not:

1. Can the muscle appearance be sustained more than the competition

2. Can they quickly get in the pose and hold the pose

3. Can they control their breathing

4. Can they control their sweating

If you look at a single picture or edited video of the Finals judging, it's hard to determine the winner if you are not there because of image quality and because of if they faded or not in the final comparisons.

EXAMPLE:

[https://youtu.be/nwSuIUyW9JM?t=252](https://youtu.be/nwSuIUyW9JM?t=252)

Watch Big Ramy in last year's Arnold. I linked it to the part where they moved him down. He is late getting into the pose, watch his breathing... he can't hold it. Compare that to Kuclo — who has much more control.

Look at the experienced professionals Bonac and Dexter, they get into the pose quick and they stay like that longer than the others:

[https://youtu.be/nwSuIUyW9JM?t=128](https://youtu.be/nwSuIUyW9JM?t=128)

My point is Fading is the sport aspect that nobody mentions. The judges push them for a length of time to see which one's breathing/sweating/posing/muscle and etc gets worser, quicker. A single instagram photo is not showing who won, the entire final comparisons show who won.","bodybuilding, fitness"

Hey guys.

I'm 6'5 and weight 150 pounds.... this is me: [https://imgur.com/a/hsfYYOm](https://imgur.com/a/hsfYYOm)

Will i benefit from bodyweight exercises or should I join a gym? I feel like my proportions will make it harder for me to gain mass with bodyweight exercises. A lot of my tall friends are very dogmatic in that gym is the only way to gain respectable muscle for a tall guy. I'm not sure if I can believe them.

Of course, you can build mass as a rookie from practically any exercise but I want to invest in boydweight equipment and be sure it will pay off in the long run. Long limbs and gymnastic rings sound like a terrible combo to me - hopefully it is my rookie instinct messing with me. Also, the idea of pistol squats sounds absolutely insane to me since my legs are build for hunting frogs in a swamp and I can't fandom how such a long range of motion with such a low weight will make them grow past the initial noob gains.

Also, is it even worth filling out my frame? I feel like I don't have the base to look good even with normal BMI. I've seen skinny guys with bad frames gaining respectable amount of muscle but their proportions were so off that they looked far better before.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hi everyone

I'm over a year following RR. My progress is very good. I'm reached, the point where I have to decide what to do next. I'm mostly  on advanced exercises and RR routine make me very tired. It was excellent until now. I do currently 15kg dips ,20 kg flat possition rows ,85 kg squat ( I can do more ,but don't wanna progress here at the moment) , normal pull-ups ( straggling here to get more volume),65 kg Romanian deadlift ,85 kg deadlift, nearly full pseudoplanche pushups.  I do either find new program or do some adjustments to RR routine. I have been searching for programs. The most I like is Fitnessfaq ,but then I found information about gymnastics method from Adam Godrosi. I would like ask if someone doing this program or have done in past. I will appreciate any advice how to adjust RR to make further progress and not dying after workout. Maybe longer brakes between sets? I don't know. Of course I will appreciate advice on any other good program there with good references. My main goal is have very strong core to avoid back pain which I didn't have since starting RR. It's excellent program I would like to continue ,but I'm without power on last exercises.(weighted rows , following by pseudoplanche pushups are proper killers). I do own the OG2 book as well ,but I have absolutely no time to reading it properly and study. I do work 80 hours a week and I just wanna follow some programs three times a week max 1:30 min. I don't have more time.

"Calisthenics is a great tool for improving balance, endurance, coordination and a whole bunch of other stuff however it isn't the most optimal for building raw strength. In contrast we have power lifting which is pretty much the opposite, it's great for building power but not so optimal for general athleticism. It would be pretty great if it was possible to get the best of both worlds.

I read a couple of articles and reddit posts that covers the topic of combining power lifting and calisthenics, however i found them pretty lacking, not least in the routines they provide.

Most of the routines treat the calisthenics as accessory exercises to be done after completing a weight lifting workout. Doing it this way would halt the progress of the skill one wants to learn. I mean how are you supposed to progress the planche right after a heavy push day?

The other routines simply separate the workouts into different days. So maybe they'll do weights 3 times a week and body weights twice a week. I do prefer this over the accessory type routine however i have a suggestion that might trump both.

Or its really dumb, idk.

The idea is to train opposite muscle groups with weight training and calisthenics in each workout. So for example an upper body workout might focus the weight lifting on push movements while the calisthenics is focused on pull movements, then the next workout switches which muscle group gets which type of training. As such we should be able to do standard weightlifting and have it compliment the calisthenics instead of infringing on it.

Of course this might inhibit muscle rest since a lot of muscle groups are trained pretty frequently.

Anyways, here is an example routine:

day 1 - weight push, calisthenics pull:

bench press

military press

pull ups

lever (progression)

inverted rows (progression)

day 2 - weight legs, abs?:

squats

bulgarian split squats

calf raises

pistol squats?

maybe abs here?

day 3 - weight pull, calisthenics push:

deadlift

barbell row

dips

planche (progression)

handstand push ups (progression)

I'll update this post as i continue researching this to see if it actually makes sense.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi everyone,
Just feeling elated as I've now almost completed one year of my bodyweight fitness journey and would like to share my progress with you guys..

Used to weight 62kgs at 17.3% bodyfat, 28.9kg muscle mass at the start of this year...
Now I'm at 63kgs with 8.5% bodyfat and 31.8 kg muscle mass.. (Body recomposition...)
Height: 5'7""

Skills Unlocked:

Pistol squats,
L-Sit Holds on parallets ,
Advanced tuck planche hold on parallets ,
Front lever raises, (can hold for 2 sec.. so not sure if that counts..)
Superman pushups, (Was able to do clap pushups earlier..)
Toe touch pushups,
Behind clap pushups,


Progressive overload:
+20kg weighted pull-ups (5-6 reps),
Was able to bench 60kgs, although I don't do bench press generally,
Was able to squat 70kgs,
One arm pushup form improved a lot...


Planning to continue this journey forward and hopefully planning to unlock planche, muscle ups in 2022...
I suck at the transition phase.. so focusing on tiger bent pushups and trying to unlock russian dips...


Routine was more intuition based (Got calimove course but didn't follow that...)
Was following a push pull leg split...

"I spent a number of years trying to increase my metabolic rate while weight training 6x per week and this put me in a great position whereby I could pretty much eat whatever I liked without worrying about fat gain. Pretty much a version of 'you can't out train a bad diet.' Technically you can if you training accordingly. 

I switched over to Recommended routine a year ago and I've started to gain fat and I'm attributing this down to less caloric demand due to only training 3x per week which is half what I used to do. The workout itself is the same. The intensity is just as high, but the frequency is much less. I tried to increase to 6 days, whereby 3 days were recommended routine and the days in between were skill work but the skill work just wasn't intense enough to induce enough caloric demand to match the calorie intake I was on. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this and what they did about it without reducing calorie intake,  because the exercises themselves are tough, no doubt about that, but an attempted and failed handstand on an off day isn't as metabolically demanding as a deadlift or even a set of cable shoulder raises or Barbell curls. 

I'll repeat that I'm not taking about the actual RR. The 6 exercises and core triplet is just as demanding. It's more the days off or 'skills days' which aren't aren't same","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I’ve found a cardio plan that has been working really well for me and am considering applying it to resistant training. What I do is have a weekly goal to jog/walk at least 15 miles each week. I allow myself to break it up throughout the week however I please. I’m usually motivated early on in the week and knock out a big chunk the first 3 days. 

With lifting, I struggle to follow through with my weekly routine. So I was thinking of trying a weekly goal and allowing myself to break it up however I want, doing whatever exercises I feel like and just keeping track on paper until I’ve done it all for the week. Something like:

Pushups: 300
Chinups: 80
Pullups: 75
Crunches: 200
Trap shrugs: 100
Kettlebell Squats: 120
Dips: 100
Curls: 80

"Both of them say they're rated for 400lbs and about 22 inches long, so it seems like the primary issue is height/base diff as shown at https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mgeRyLlwS._AC_SL1500_.jpg where the XL (black) is 31 inches high instead of 28, with 18 inch bases instead of 16.

I haven't measured my arm length but I figure the more height the better (can use a stool if I need to shorten it) in terms of versatility, and a wider base that wobbles less seems safer.

It'd a big chunk though so I'm wondering if I ought to shop around for alternatives. Just not sure how safe they are...

""Yeego"" is selling for 90 right now for example, rated for 350lbs, with 16.4 inch bases and bars are ~24 high and 28 long. So the added length is attraction, but not the lesser height. If I were to get this it would be for the neat feature where you can bolt them together on one side using this attachment: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yTu-lwmlL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

""Power Guidance"" claims to be rated for 500 pounds, has adjustible heights between 30 and 38, so it might be the top-o-line one though it costs 150+tax. The metric measurements throw me off for comparisons, but I'm wondering how safe adjustible bars are, does this look sturdy? https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aA+Z5baFL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

Those ""build it yourself"" tutorials are nice but I'm not sure how much I trust my craftsmanship or if the hardware store guys would help.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I've tried progressing on pullups and I just despite doing them at high reps. I can just about get 3 or 4 sets of 9 to 10 reps, bodyweight. But i dread the exercise so much doing that many reps. I don't know why, I don't have this issue with any other exercise but pullups my mind just dies a little inside when I'm doing pullups for high reps. 

 The issue is I really want to do pullups for my back development.

 I know that I'll be able to stick to 3 sets of 5. Is there any point in me buying a weight belt and just progressing weight wise at 3 sets of 5 reps weighted pullups for building muscle? 

And btw I love lat pulldowns and similar exercises but I don't have access to machines so pullups/chinups are my only vertical pulling thing I can do (I have plenty of weights for heavy pendlay rows and stuff but no machines).","bodybuilding, fitness"
"These are the three skills I would most like to achieve right now, problem is that after I complete my Muscle up training (in which I don’t achieve a single muscle-up) my central nervous system is so fried that I am incapable of performing any of my L-sit progressions.

This is where I am at with each individual movement.

Muscle-ups: consistently hitting just below collar bone with pull ups, no higher and trying to become more explosive - not quite there yet
L-sit: tuck L-sit for 30-32s (unable to achieve even half of this after completing my muscle-up work)
Pistol squats: 20 touchdown squats from a platform knee height from the ground (roughly 1-1.5 feet)

I have gotten comfortable with doing 20+ reps of ring push ups (with rings turned out on the top) and i want to move on to a more challenging movement. I am debating whether i should move on to rto push ups or deep ring push ups. My current goal is chest hypertrophy and strength. I also want to put more emphasis on the upper portion of my chest because my lower chest is overdeveloped because of dips.

I heard that the RTO push up stimulates the upper chest more because it has a similar movement pattern to a reverse grip bench press, which is supposedly a good upper chest exercise. On the other hand, I heard that the deep ring push ups are good for upper chest because of increased ROM.

Also, one last question, if i were to perform RTO push ups should i do them with slightly flared elbows if i want to stimulate my chest more?","bodybuilding, fitness"

I'm 186 cm and 95 kg.

I'm **really** trying to start exercising but I struggle with some personal problems and I can't even do one pushup, so the BWF primer routine already seems a bit much.

"Hi everyone, 

I am a female (5'3 and 140 lbs) and I would like to start a home fitness program. I am looking for a quiet fitness program that I can do in my apartment without bothering my neighbours. I cannot lift weights as I am recovering from a hand injury. I also have anemia and I noticed that doing crunches makes me really dizzy. I am not sure what kind of workout I should do. I am looking for something easy that I could adhere to on a daily basis. So far, my plan is to do lunges and squats, but I wonder if anyone can recommend some other exercises for the lower body (to work around my hand injury).

I like to train to be generally all around athletic and mobile - so flexibility, strength, endurance, jack of all trades master of none, though my primary goal is fat loss (I'd like to hit \~12% body fat and maintain that). I run twice a week for 30min, leg day twice a week for 30min, and upper body day twice a week for about an hour. I do a 20min yoga routine after each workout, so that's 6 days a week I'm active. I can provide more detail upon request, but usually when I run I just vary my pace depending on how I feel, I use a lower body calisthenics routine largely derived from knees over toes guy, and my upper body routine is mostly rings based from coach Sommer's book, about half of the workout on isometrics and the other half on dynamics.

  
I'm thinking about perhaps moving the running in concert with my leg day in order to grant me two additional rest days, but I'm not really sure if running after my lower body day is a good idea. I'd like to hear what other people have to say. I'm somewhat open to removing running altogether, which I've done in the past but I always eventually add it back in because I enjoy cardio and find its benefits useful.

I'll also add that my environment is generally stressful and that for sure impacts my recovery, but there isn't much I can do about that at the moment (I'm writing my dissertation as a PhD student, for one).","bodybuilding, fitness"

"I've been doing body weight fitness about 3-4 times per week for about 2 years now. Beginning with youtube videos, after about a year found out myself in a standstill and started to work on my own routine.

Being a dad, 33 years old, found wonderful results coming from a really skinny build to skinny fat and bulking after working out regularly, I have never been in a better shape.

My issue is the ""progressive overload"" term. Doing 5-8 exercises, each 4 sets with variable reps with the last until ""burnout"" keeps giving me pain in the joints(mostly tendons).

How do you guys measure your progression? I find myself often either doing to little or going overboard and my tendons hurting while my muscles being perfectly being able to work out 2-3 days later. Lifting a few more ponds at the gym is waaaay easier to measure then measuring the posture and reps as well as sets with bodyweight.

"Hi all,

I’ve progressed to weighted dips, been doing these for a while but just wanted to confirm what my leg position should be to maximise results from the exercise. Mainly want to ensure chest is getting worked (ideally lower chest more if possible).

For weighted dips using a belt, my bars are not high enough to allow me to have a straight body from head to toe so I have been leaning forward with my thighs  perpendicular to the floor, my lower legs are at a 90 degree angle to my thighs, behind me parallel to the floor (I don’t cross them and I try to keep my legs together always squeezing tight). Is this good leg positioning for weighted dips? Or should I lean forward and try to keep a straight line from my head to my knees and then have lower legs behind me parallel to the floor?

Also I want to try to move onto ring dips, I have a pull up bar but it’s not high enough to have a straight body without my feet touching the ground, what is the best alternative leg position? Can I maintain a tuck L position all throughout the dip? Or how about maintain a straight body where I can, but lift my legs slightly up in front of me before they touch the floor? Would bending knees and lower legs behind me work?

"[https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy) (me trying to replicate the different forms of Pike push-up that I'm talking about)

Hey there, this is kind of an exploratory/debate post where I would like to have your opinion and experience on the topic of pike push-up form. My main intent behind this post is to understand which approach is best for strength gains and transferability towards skills like HSPU and bent-arm presses. Every single tutorial on the pike push-up has a slightly different approach and gives different form cues, even when leaving aside the plain bad ones (wrt calisthenics transferability at least) like ""elbows flared out/head touching the ground between the hands/purely vertical plane of motion"" (as in [this picture](https://www.google.com/search?q=pike+push+up&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5jtjC5J_1AhUWQEEAHQM2BFUQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=942&dpr=1#imgrc=M0qjGb6MgOivNM)). Even among the main well-recognized calisthenics influencers, there are significant disparities on the topic of pike push-ups.

# The different forms

I think there are mainly 2 approaches, although there is a whole spectrum between these two ""extremes"". These approaches seem to agree on what the top-part of the ROM should be (elevating the shoulders as much as possible, tucking the head between the shoulders, as shown [in picture A](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy)), but differ in the lower part of the ROM.

\- The first one (depicted [in picture B](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy)) advocates for a diagonal movement, where the goal is to touch the ground with the nose very far forward in front the hands in order to increase the ROM. This is the form promoted for instance by Antranik in [this detailed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/b2z06d/pike_pushups_are_an_excellent_progression/). With this form, it is considered that some arching in the back is OK, since it would be very hard to maintain a perfect posterior pelvic tilt and hollow body in this position.

\- The second one (depicted [in picture C](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy)) advocates for a movement that is closer to vertical, where the goal is to lower the head until the forehead or top of the head touches the ground and forms a \~equilateral triangle with the hands. Examples of influencers promoting this technique are FitnessFAQs (for instance in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yLcLmhhjDw) from 1:35 on), SaturnoMovement ([in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cT6ug3WVn4)), Tom Merrick ([here from 3:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdEOdHGt9HY)). A particular emphasis is placed on maintaining a Posterior pelvic tilt, and preventing any kind of arching in the back. Another cue that is given in some of these videos is to purposefully shift as much of your weight as possible on your hands from the very beginning of the motion, only tipping as lightly as possible on your toes.

\- An example of an in-between approach would be that proposed by Yaad Mohammad in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQhrk6WMcKw) from 6:40 on: he touches the ground with his nose, but not too far forward, and insists on keeping a hollow body (which I tried to replicate [in picture D](https://imgur.com/a/Hghxyxy)).

# My experience

I've experimented with these different forms in the past several months (on the grind for the frog-to-handstand), and my feeling so far has been the following: I found the second, more vertical form noticeably harder than the first one (with all other parameters equal: elevation of the feet, distance from feet to hands), and felt a stronger load on my shoulders, whereas I feel like the first form somewhat offloads the shoulders in favor of the upper pecs in the lower range of motion (probably due to its slight resemblance to pseudo-planche push-ups). I've noticed that trying to touch the ground with my nose instead of my forehead induces some arching in my back, which seems to make the movement a bit easier as well, despite the increased ROM. In my experience, the ""shift your weight on your hands"" cue makes the exercise significantly harder, and when your feet are close enough to your hands, they should almost be able to lift off the ground when at the bottom of the ROM.

I'm still not anywhere close to getting a full HSPU or bent-arm press, so I didn't want to draw conclusions based on my experience alone. Which is why I would like to hear your opinion!

# What is your opinion?

1. Which form has the best carry-over to skills like handstand push-ups and bent-arm presses?
2. From an anatomical/biomechanical perspective, what makes the second form harder than the first one?

PS: I know that this post is kind-of nitpicking, and that just getting the reps in is more important than debating endlessly about form, but still I really like learning more about the theory and the anatomy/biomechanics around calisthenics!","bodybuilding, fitness"

2. I came across a study that got some decent media attention 2 years ago providing a correlation between getting the tonsils out and upper respiratory infections / IBS.

"**Overview of normal scapulohumeral rhythm**

One common""recommend techniques"" I've seen here and commonly parroted in a broscience manner across various YouTube videos for learning pullups and chinups is to depress and retract the scapulas before beginning pullups and chinups. For reference, contracting the muscles around the scapulas is generally considered active hang where the scapular muscles are engaged versus passive hang (e.g. dead hang) when you relax all of the arm, shoulder, and torso muscles and simply hang there. Most fitness professionals advise active hang into pullups and chinups as the correct technique. They're split on dead hang into active hang into pullups or chinups but that's another topic. 

[In normal scapulohumeral rhythm](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Scapulohumeral_Rhythm) the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint contributes approximately up to 120 degrees of range of motion while the scapulas contribute about 60 degrees of range of motion through upward rotation. 

> When we perform flexion, the glenohumeral (GH) joint contributes 100°-120°. The scapula on the thorax contributes to elevation (flexion and abduction) of the humerus by upwardly rotating the glenoid fossa 50° to 60° from its resting position.[1] If the humerus were fixed to the fossa, this alone would result in up to 60° of elevation of the humerus. The humerus, of course, is not fixed but can move independently on the glenoid fossa.

This normal range of motion of the shoulder is thus 180 degrees which is moving your arm directly over your head in the 120 degrees GH and 60 degrees scapular ratio (2:1). The [upward rotation of the scapulas](https://injuryactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/upwardrot.png) is critically important to moving the arm directly overhead.

**The potential problem**

Scapular retraction with the arm overhead more than 120 degrees (120-180 degrees) prevents upward rotation of the scapula by pulling the bottom of the scapula (inferior angle) toward the spine which rotates it back down. The muscles involved are the rhomboids, mid trap, and low trap muscles. This means performing scapular retraction when the arms are overhead can put more force and compression on the underside of the acromion (can be a risk factor for subacromial impingement and/or bursitis) and rotator cuff muscles (can a risk factor for RC tendinopathy) if the activation timing and movement isn't synced right.

Thus, for those who have poor range of motion overhead or poor syncing of the activation patterns of muscles during movement, this can cause pain with the arms overhead during pullups or scapular pullups. 

This is why I only advise depression of the scapulas with the arms fully overhead and not any retraction until movement, especially if you have any pre-existing shoulder issues. It can be more harmful than helpful in some cases.For those having pain in the shoulders when overhead during pullups or scapular pullups this is a much safer cue. These people may need to take a break from pullups and do some specific rotator cuff and scapular strengthening as well. 

**TL:DR**

* Scapular retraction before the initial onset of a pullup can increase the forces on certain shoulder areas and lead to pain, especially in those with previous shoulder issues, lack of range of motion, joint laxity, or certain shoulder conditions (e.g. type II or III acromions). 
* If you experience some pain with active hang before pullups especially with retraction see if eliminating the retraction in hang can help. 
* Generally, only depression of the scapulas is necessary to stabilize the scapula for the pullup or chinup, so no retraction at the initial onset tends to be a bit safer for most.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey all,

I’ve been on a bulking endeavor for about 6 weeks now. I started at around 198 pounds, 32 years old. I did a TDEE calculation (estimation) and it listed my maintenance at 6’3 200 pounds as 3200 calories with moderate exercise. I work a manual labor job part time and exercise 5-6 days per week for about an hour per session. I currently supplementing with whey and creatine.

Since then I have been consuming minimum 4000 calories a day. Here is an image detailing everything I eat, including macros:

https://imgur.com/a/AKw3o4O

Bear in mind, this is the minimum I eat a day. I often exceed this and consume over 4500 calories. 

I used to intermittent fast 20-4 splits so my stomach is used to accepting large amounts of food in short time. Often I will weigh myself after eating all my meals and I will clock 10-12 pounds heavier than what I did in the morning. Some mornings I weigh 205, some mornings 202, and this afternoon I weighed 200, on multiple scales. Needless to say, it can be quite demoralizing and confusing. 

The thing is, I am getting stronger and I am progressing on my movements. My body also looks slightly different from when I started. I notice some fat accumulation and my abs are starting to disappear. Though maybe some rounder and fuller muscles. So there is hope there at least. 

Is is possible my body isn’t absorbing all my calories? I intake on average 125g of fiber a day. Could this contribute to malabsorption of calories? I am not very young so it’s not like I can attribute this to a super fast metabolism. Any input would be appreciated. Though I suspect many answers will be “eat more”. So be it if that’s the case. 

Thanks.

Slightly different lighting in these images but I think the differences are noticeable.

Edit: I should note that I feel good. Consistent energy levels, no lasting aches and pains. Even my bothersome quad tendon is getting better. Today for example I surfed in the morning, exercised for an hour in the afternoon and am rock climbing tonight. On days like today I always eat extra, easily 4500 calories. I feel my body is running optimally.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm 16/M 177cm, 5'9 and 64kg. I would say i'm quite skinny and my legs are probably the heaviest since I used to ride my bike a lot. So yesterday I bought a gym membership, So I have two goals in mind because I'm quite skinny I want to get bigger I heard going to gym might help and I don't mean like super big, but my goal is being able to do Calisthenics. So yesterday was my first 2 hour visit in the gym and I am planing to do my calisthenics workout in the evenings do that my muscles are trained for calisthenics. Now my question is should I keep going to the gym even though my goal is something else and do my calisthenics workout at home during evenings, or should I just stick with either gym or calisthenics?

What do you guys think?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi!

I need help to get my current program tweaked to see some progress.

Can anyone help me understand why I am not progressing, if that is too much or not, and if is anything missing in my routine that should be there? Also any suggestions for books to read on calisthenics programming (already have and used Overcoming Gravitiy), or paid calisthenics program are very welcome.

I am a 35 y.o. calisthenics and movement enthusiast and I have been moving every day and living healthy since my teens/early twenties, first with boxing and full contact, now with calisthenics every day.

I am trying to get to the next level since I am stuck with the same reps/exercises since a while now, **my objectives are:**

* Calisthenics feats like muscle-up, freestanding handstand push ups, perfect one arm push ups, one arm pull ups, etc.
* Movement and floreio like feats and work outs
* Keeping in general my body flexible and mobile
* Strenght delopment

**My current routine looks like the below.** 

Monday / Pull:

* 5 minutes muscle up work
* Pull up Rings: 5-6 reps x 4-5 sets (min. 25 reps total)
* Ring Rows on Rings: 8-10 x 3 sets
* 2-3 minutes each of tuck front and back lever

Tuesday / Floreio workout n.4, thus:

* Ido warm up
* Handstand drills, Gatherings + rotations into low bridge + Volta por Cima /Queda De Rins x 10 reps each x 3-4 sets
* \- plus a bodyline drill / plank in all positions for core strenght

Wednesday / Leg:

Ido squat clinic

* Harop Curls 5-6 reps x 4-5 sets
* Box Pistol or elevated heel pistol 3-5 reps x 5 – 6 sets (total min. 25 reps)
* Bulgarian splis 3 sets of 8-10 reps
* X5 sprints
* Core: 6 reps x 3 leg raises and some attempts in human flag

Stretching / mobility

* Thursday / Floreio n.5 but modified
* Ido warm up
* Rotations into low bridge sets, au cortado, role into QDR

Friday / Push Day

* Rings Dips 5-6 reps x 4-5 sets (tot. min 25)
* Handstand push up on wall about 6-12 reps with rest as much as needed
* Rings Push-Up (Archer): 3-5 reps x 3-4 sets
* Tuck planchet on floor, attempts for about 3 minutes

Saturday / mobility

* Some easy hips, ankles and wrist mobility drills with 3x jump rope and some attempts at move such as the volta por cima but just a few.

DELOAD week every 2 weeks of training, cutting volume by a half.

I would appreciate a lot any comment or suggestions, I just can’t think of nothing else but about this in the last few days…


EDIT: I just figured out that there is a HUGE amount of knowledge here on Reddit that I should read that will answer many of my current doubts...will need to take some days to go through everything.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Yesterday on this subreddit I asked a question tangentially related to how to make my workouts shorter and  someone told me to look at the microroutine strategies from RedDeltaProject (Youtube  channel). One of the strategies was incorporating dropsets. However I'm not exactly sure how ""hard"" the dropsets should exactly be (where to stop) and how many they should be. I assume you should obviously reduce the total number of sets. 

I created this routine for my push day containing two drop sets per muscle group (instead of 6) and they are very hard dropsets. I just finished the routine and I feel like my muscles are about to disintegrate. It looks something like this: 

Push dropset: 

Decline PPPUs ->
PPPUs ->
Diamond push-ups ->
Push-ups ->
Incline push-ups ->
Knee push-ups ->
Incline knee push-ups ->
Wall push-ups ->
Knee wall push-ups 

Squat dropset (the assisted pistol squats are when I help myself by holding onto a sort of handle with either fingers or the whole hand):

Dumbbell pistol squats ->
One-finger assisted pistol squats ->
Two-finger assisted pistol squats -> 
Hand assisted pistol squats ->
Bulgarian split squats ->
Squats 

Each ""miniset"" taken to or close to failure. Repeat the push dropset twice and do the squat dropset once. Finish the workout. Repeat 3 times a week for a push/pull/push/pull/push/pull/rest routine.

This reduces the total number of sets from 9 (6 push sets and 3 squat sets) to 3 (2 push sets and 1 squat set) although the sets themselves are way harder. Including a quick 5 minute warmup this workout took me ~25 minutes. 

Is this overtraining? Under-training? On one hand you could say I'm doing 18 push sets per workout but on the other hand you could say I'm only doing 2. I assume this is less effective for strength but is it as effective for hypertrophy as a typical routine like the recommended routine? How much would it help for strength that transfers to other movements like HeSPU, planche, etc. ?","bodybuilding, fitness"

"So I am a teenager who was merely overweight. I used to weight around 83 kg. At the start of 2021 I decided to make a change and so I did I started working out at home very minimally. I was dropping weight. I was only doing cardio and not resistance training. Throught my journey until October I lost roughly 20 kg. But as I toned down my body fat percentage I quickly realized that I should start training for muscle growth. So I started doing calisthenics at home and also started bulking( eating in a surplus) Since then I gained 2 kg of weight( mainly muscle). But I do not really see the changes I want, I actually see very minimal changes and that frustrates and upsets me. Sometime when I workout I feel weaker than the last workout, so my motivation is running low. So I wanted to ask this community for tips, maybe you can help me.
Also this is my routine: 

Upper body day #1: Monday(3 sets ×10-15 reps each exercise)
Warmup
Frogstand progression 
L-sit progression
Pushups
Dips(band assisted)
Diamond pushups (on knee)
Skull crushers
Pike pushups( I cant do them very well)or lateral raises 
Inverted Rows
Pullups(band assisted)
Chinups (band assisted)

Lower body day #1: Tuesday( here I also add a little bit of weight)
Warmup
Frog stand progression
Elbow Lever progression
Leg raises 
Squats 
Glute raises
Bulgarian split squats
Lunges
Romanian deadlifts

Wednesday is a rest day
Thursday and Friday are like Monday and Tuesday","bodybuilding, fitness"
"WARNING: long read. So almost a year ago now I went into surgery for multiple injuries to my bicep and shoulder. It all started as a result of a 10 year old workplace injury, but as time marched on it led to more issues. I got bicep tenodesis surgery, shoulder labrum surgery, and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my ACL along with the bursas drained.  

Frankly, post surgery was awful. I’ll save you those details. It’ll suffice to say when I was cleared to start working out regularly (after following my physical therapy to a T) I did. But I was so embarrassed at my strength. I left the gym one day and cried in my car because of how weak I became compared to others. I couldn’t go back.

The toughest part was losing pull ups, my favorite exercise. I majorly struggled with pull ups, one because all that upper body strength was gone, but two because mentally I felt I couldn’t start over again. And then, as if a light bulb turned on, I remembered greasing the groove. 

So that’s what I did. I started hanging from the bar a few times a day. Shit, even that took work. Then I’d attempt one pull up. Then two. Then three. Then four. And so on. Knowing I wasn’t going anywhere near failure gave me the space to accept my weakness, because I knew I’d just try again later. And it felt so easy, so accessible, that not only was that mental block gone, but the strength to do full pull ups bounced right back. 

I still have some issues. Push ups are taking a long time to recover. And some exercises still feel funny. But without greasing the groove, I don’t know if I’d ever have gotten the confidence back to just…try. 

So with that said, thanks. I don’t know where I’d be without such a simple concept. 

TL;dr: GTG helped my recovery

Edit: just wanna say thanks for the kind words, and for everyone else who’s in recovery you can message anytime. I know I had trouble talking to people about how I felt so if I can spare someone that feeling so much the better","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm curious about this. My daughter, who is 9 and can do everything, was sitting in what I would call a butt down (but off the ground) reverse table top position, and to stand up she kind of moved her bodyweight over her feet, into a deep squat, and then stood up.

I have very limited dorsiflexion due to an ankle fracture that is not going to improve, but I tried it anyway and... I can't even come close. it feels like my body is like actively pushing me back but it doesn't feel like it is just the ankle. 

I'd like to get this exercise down so I tried using a rope and kind of pulling myself into a deep squat. Curious if anyone has any other ideas of intermediate stuff I could add to develop the skill?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello,

I am doing the recommended routines for 3 days. I've been doing it for 3 months now. I can see the progress (eg. 0 pull up to 3 pullups) but I am still a beginner. 

I would like to do a skill day on my rest day. I think I should focus on one skill at a time. (I have looked at the skill day page. It has L-sit and handstand) What would you guys suggest? Should I focus on one skill at a time or multiple related skills? 

I am planning to start with L-sit. I am looking for a list of skills that I can target. 

I saw this list below in one of the youtube videos.  

__Edited__ I got this list from a youtube video ""Abnormal_Beings's How to Start Calisthenics - Calisthenics Skills Guide on what to Learn First"". I think it's similar to this answer. https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-beginners-to-advanced-skills-that-should-be-learned-in-calisthenics/answer/Mustafa-Rakhmet

What do you guys think about this list? Should I train them in that order? 

**Novice**

  1. L-sit
  2. Muscle up
  3. Pull over
  4. Skin the cat
  5. Frogstand
  6. Planche lean
  7. Elbow Level
  8. Headstand (Correction: Not handstand)

**Intermediate**

  1. handstand
  2. Dragon flag
  3. Human Flag
  4. handstand push up
  5. Tucked rows
  6. tucked planche
  7. back level
  8. front lever
  9. one-arm push up
  10. V-sit

**Advanced**

  1. straight arm handstand presses
  2. Straddle planche
  3. one arm pull up
  4. 90 degree handstand push up
  5. front lever pull up
  6. full planche
  7. Maltese
  8. Iron cross

Thanks.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm curious if anyone has tried a greasing the groove style approach but for the whole body rather than just one exercise? 

Eg something like Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, Dips. Depending on how it goes maybe add Kettlebell Swings in the future. 

I work from home, have all the equipment I need and have plenty of time on my hands. So I could easily do each exercise one per hour. I could even separate out the 2 upper and lower body exercises eg: Pull Ups, Kettlebell Squats, (wait 30 mins), Dips, Kettlebell Swings, (wait 30 mins), repeat.  

I’d also do some light cardio after work just once a day, taking rest days from this as needed. I'd say I'm currently at an intermediate level.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Update: 18 months of BWF - M/36/5’10

[Progress pic collage](https://imgur.com/a/0CaQEgs)

[Progress pic sbs 8/20 -10/21](https://imgur.com/a/c2M2QXL)

I promised I’d update the community that’s given me so much, so here it is. First pic is from 5/24/20, middle photos are from 12/2020 and the bottom row are from June 2021. The photos on the right are from 12/2021. Sorry for the poor quality, lost some of the OG photos so had to screen grab my last post. 

Again, I was apprehensive about posting an update since the comments continue to get harsher but looking at the collage reminds me that i should be proud of every muscle fiber as well as every loose flap of skin. Hopefully this inspires some of you folks that are thinking about making a change to start today. PM’s are open :)

Instead of trying to go on a cut for this post, I decided to go authentic. I’m dude in my 30’s happy living my life and having fun. In October I had a bad skateboarding crash (check out my right eye) and was in the ER for 2 days with a head injury. I tried to stay consistent but definitely felt the pressure building in my head so I had to take it super easy for about 6 weeks. I’m still dealing with a lot of right elbow pain from some nerve damage but it’s slowly getting better and hopefully I can start working in chin-up variations again. Although it was tough getting back into the rhythm of my routine, overcoming laziness and self pity only boosted my confidence. It’s like the goat said, “In the struggle is where life happens.” - Jeff goldbum’s acting teacher from a desus and meró interview. 


Here’s my current routine:
- ring towel assisted pull-up
- 1-legged pistol squat
- ring dips w/knee twist (no RTO because of elbow pain)
- Nordic curl (negative with push-up asst)
- tucked ring row 
- RTO push-up
- ab circuit (r/leanbeefpatty edition: v-ups, bicycles, flutter kick, leg crunch, Russian twist). 

Equipment: 
Rings 

Supps:
- vegan protein shake (~5x’s a week)
- 5mg creatine (~4x’s a week)
- multivitamin (~3x’s a week) 

Happy holidays to all! Let’s get this shih!

Edit: also the poses are relaxed, flexed side profile no flex","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So my main goal is to be able to do dips and pull up at a heavier weight but i also want to build muscle mass. This is my routine which is a PPL split.

Pull day
Weighted pull up
3 sets weighted pull ups 5-8 reps.
Resting 3 minutes between sets. Once i hit 7reps on last set ill add 1.25-kg2.5kg for next session 

Cable rows
3 sets 8-12 reps

Chest supported rows 
3sets 8-12 reps

Bicep curl barbell
3 sets 5-8 reps 
Bicep curl dumbells
3 sets 10-15 reps

Lateral raises
3 sets 8-12 reps 

Tricep pushdown
3 sets 10-15 reps.

"Hey everyone! Of course I follow the RR. Current progressions are: ring l-sit pull ups 3x5, box HSPU (hands also elevated for ROM) 3x5, ring LFPU 5x3 (feet elevated to shoulder height), tuck FL rows 3x5, pistols 3x5, ab wheel 3x7. 

Routine is solid and I've been progressing well but I am having training ADHD/Fomo about my hinge movement, and stupidly, I've been flip flopping back and forth between KB swings and Nordic Curls. Note: no access to barbells, I understand that they're superior but it's not an option. It's also worth mentioning that my Nordics are weak and require a fair bit of assistance vs. my single 35lb kettlebell that I can swing fairly easily.

I know we like goal based Q&As here but I honestly don't have a strong 'hinge' goal, I just want to clearly outline the better option for my routine and stick with it.

So what's the popular opinion? Get better at Nordics or buy/swing perpetually heavier kettlebells for eternity?

Also, just want to preemptively thank everyone in this sub. It's been infinitely informative, entertaining and satisfying my need to research things into the ground for a very long time now. So thanks!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I've recently started paying more attention to my body and the biggest issue I have is my torso. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/bwsIwlJ) is what it looks like. So as you can see, my ribs are visible, my stomach is flat and the whole torso just looks absolutely tiny. I recently lost some weight due to some stressful situations, and are currently sitting at 59 kg while being 177 cm tall. I am in the process of gaining weight, but my rib cage remains visible all the time.

Apart from simply eating more, could anyone recommend me something that could help me simply look better? I used to exercise 3 times a week before my weight loss, but haven't done much since that time and I am willing to work on it.

"This is a question we all ask at some point, but I've never seen concrete, quantitative answers. Just how long should it take, or does it take, to add one rep/progress to the next variant/put another textbook in your backpack?

Of course, there is not one simple answer. There are a lot of factors involved, such as:

* Personal factors
    * How old are you?
    * How tall are you?
    * How heavy are you?
    * Are you male?
    * How are testosterone and other hormonal factors impacting you?
    * How are injuries and other physical factors affecting you?
* Training factors
    * How long have you been training?
    * How often do you train?
    * How hard do you train?
    * How long do you rest?
    * How do you structure/periodize your training?
    * Have you trained enough at low intensity to prepare your tendons for more load?
* Exercise factors
    * Which exercise are you doing?
    * Which muscles does it recruit?
    * Are there skill components to the movement?
    * How much harder is the next variant?
    * How much risk of injury is there when progressing?
    * Are you using weights/resistance bands/etc?

There are many other complex topics (e.g., diet, injury, recommended routine) that we do discuss in detail, even though they don't have simple answers. Reading through discussion threads on these topics it's possible to get a sense of what's normal, what to expect, common pitfalls and problems, and so on.

But when it comes to progress rates, the only real insights I've seen are, broadly:

* Working from zero towards your first concentric is slow.
* Initial neurological adaptations (noob gains) are fast, but subsequent progress is slower.
* Progress at intermediate and advanced levels is much slower.
* Personal factors like genetics mean that different people progress at different rates.
* Some young men progress insanely fast.

That still leaves a lot of important questions in the air, such as:

* For a given exercise at a given level (e.g., getting your 5th pull up), what's the average rate of progress, what's fast, what's slow (for your sex/age/weight/etc)?
* How can you tell that you are progressing slower than you should and ought to reconsider your routine/program?
* How long before you should decide you've plateaued rather than just progressing slowly?
* Do men progress faster than women?
* How much do tall/short/heavy/light people differ in their rates of progress?
* How do progress rates change with age? How different should people's expectations be if they start training in their teens/twenties/thirties/etc.

These are just a handful of questions off the top of my head, I'm sure there are many others.

There is an amazing amount of experience and knowledge in this community, so I just wanted to throw this topic open and see what you guys think. For the sake of being quantitative though, here's a concrete question too:

    When you progressed from 5 to 10 strict-form, full-range pull ups, how long (approximately) did it take you to get each extra rep? How old were you? What's your height? What's your sex?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"So I'm reaching the ending stage of the RR and I love it so I keep doing it adding weights, I currently do weighted series on almost all exercises and I do 4 series instead of 3. 

For that, I would like to start doing planche and front lever progressions, but I don't know where to place them in the RR. I'm currently replacing the final 2 series of dips with some kind of planche progression, as right now I can do 7 reps of +20kg dips and the same for australian pull ups, which I can also use +20kg for 7 reps aprox. My end goal is to be able to do planche push ups and front lever pull ups.

Is this okay or will it affect my dips and australian pull ups in the long term without progressing on planche and front lever?

If the later, any suggestion on how to add planche and front lever to the RR?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I've loved incorporating calisthenics into my workout routine. When I train calisthenics, I feel better, less aches, and more confident about my mobility. My strength is also more symmetrical. Gymnastic rings are my favorite workout tools. But, weights and machines have a very important role in strength and fitness. In my case, I feel like weights add more mass, as it is usually easier to progressively overload. They are also very useful in isolating muscle groups.

I wanted to create a workout routine that mixes traditional bodybuilding principles and excercises, while also adding calisthenics. The goal for this routine is muscular hypertrophy. In the past, I've used calisthenic skills for warmups, and have seen very good results as long as I don't overdo it. The volume for this routine is relatively high, as I am an intermediate lifter/athlete. 

As of right now, I have a shoulder injury (calcification in my rotator cuff), which worsens with heavy bench press exercises. Ring chest excercises feel great though. So, I am limiting my bench press exercises. 

The routine is a Push/Pull/Legs split. I use bands for the warmup/skill portions.

Past: tried just using a pullup bar, and I could get up to 17 pullups chin to bar down to almost arm lock out ( \~170 degrees) but could never get muscle up. tried using cossack squat to get to pistol and many other bodyweight variation squats but decided just to get gym membership to do weighted calisthenics.

routine: everyday full body workout, consisting of weighted squats 5x8, weighted pullups 5x8, pseudo planche pushup

weighted pullups: currently lifting a 35lbs plate 5x8, usually get to at least 6 reps but go for 8

weighted squats: currently squatting 165lbs 5x8, 99/100 times hit 8 reps, think I should up the weight

pseudo planche pushup: measure from wall to base of hands: currently at 105cm to base of hands 5x8. I put a dumbell between my legs so I dont tip over forward (is this effective or taking away shoulder gains?)

Some days have bigger victories where I can have longer holds, and some days I'm more tired and have to remind myself to keep the mentality of ""quality of quantity"" while celebrating a few shorter holds. I also find it important to take breaks on some days to recover arm strength, but consistency is key. I only started in July, but was able to see more progress with the help of a personal coach at my local circus school who specializes in many different acrobatic arts including handbalancing. I could only hold a balancer of about 2-3 seconds without the wall in the beginning, but a few months later, my longest hold is 21 second. But it's far from consistent. I can maybe get good form holds every 2 in 10 kick ups at the moment, but it's a process that I try to make enjoyable by celebrating the small victories, even if it's just one or two good holds per session

What was your mentality when it came to learning handstands? Any tips/suggestions are always welcomed

"Interesting paper proposing a biological mechanism for muscle growth in response to resistance training from the Cavendish Labs in Cambridge. Nothing earth shattering from the POV of current practice, but the proposed mechanism does a much better job of explaining things than 'exercise damages the muscles which regrow bigger'.

"Hey Y'all,

First post here so apologies if I am breaking a rule. I recently moved into a new apartment with some super nice high ceilings. The first thing I thought when I walked in the front door was ""Man, these are tall enough to train muscle ups indoors. As a result of this I have been researching the Khanh Trinh foldable pull up bar on amazon. It is tall enough to do muscle ups on it but my biggest concern is whether it is stable enough? 

Has anyone here ever used this pull up bar for muscle up training and if so would you be able to recommend it? The bar has a pretty hefty price of about 300ish dollars so I would hate to waste money on something that's a dud. There are very few reviews and although the company says it can be used for muscle ups I am still fairly skeptical.

Thanks for any time and assistance. Much appreciated","bodybuilding, fitness"

For a sort of perspective on my abilities so far, I’m 6”2 185 lbs and I can do 10 pull-ups after I’m warmed up, my push-ups go to 25 max, and I can plank for maybe a minute or so at max. Not sure what that says to experienced people, just trying to give a perspective of what I’ve worked up to so far.

"Hi everyone,

I'm training since 3 years now and I really like how my body have evolved to what it is today. I find a real passion arround the bodyweight fitness. Currently, I have a program that I do 2 days per week.

Only downside is, my biceps are completely a weak point.  They are short.

I have tried to stimulate them with multiple exercices that I have removed or kept in my program (Bodyweight curls during 5 months, Pelican curls during 6 months, One arm chin up progression that I have kept in my program).

I have even tried to isolate them with some dumbbells exercices (which is no more the case). I also tried to work on the brachialis. I don't feel that my biceps are growing even when I have progressed on all this exercices. That's why I'm asking for advice here.

How could I work on them to make them grow ?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"https://i.imgur.com/3VlIPRa.png

I can only get my brain around ""shoulder below hands"" type of hanging. That's the type of thing I'm used to doing with chins and pullups.

I guess I'm not understanding ""why don't the hands spin around the bar"" when arms are at the angle this guy's are in the pics. Maybe I'm being low-IQ about physics or something?

As best I can think of this, by leaning backwards your center-of-mass is no longer ""below"" your shoulders so where they go wouldn't matter, and it does look like his navel is underneath the bar.

So in theory maybe you don't need to grip the bar at all (ie just bend the first knuckle but not the rest?) to create anti-rotation? Like one of those ""no hands pull"" wrist monstrosities but not quite so extreme?

But the stress is clearly different on the lats in some way because of the angle of the torso and I guess the leverage on the lats?","bodybuilding, fitness"

"I plan to only use calisthenics for upper body, as my goal is to attain the basic advanced exercises (Handstand Push Up, Planche Push Up, Front Lever Row, One Arm Pull Up and Muscles Ups). The reason for these moves are that they’ll stick with me and maintain strength to perform in any sports and life activities without reliance on external weight, and keeping equipment minimal since at most the luxury of rings is a nice addition.

As stated above, one of my goal is to keep my equipment minimal at home in my studio apartment. I have a pull up bar, rings, parallettes, and a 50 lb strongman sandbag on the way. I also have a pair of Olympic Dumbbell Handles, but don’t wanna try on them if I can just get the same strength gain benefits from Sandbags and Bodyweight.

I’d like to add that I’ll be joining MMA, bjj, judo and other martial arts facilities. If I ever need further strength at a faster pace, then I’ll use their weights (assuming they have).

As for the sandbag move to strengthen the muscles that deadlift and squats hit would be sandbag shouldering.

This would mean my routine would be the Recommended Routine for upper body, and progressively moving up in weight with sandbag shouldering as my replacement for both the squat and deadlift.

Again, the goal is to keep the daily routine minimal, fast, yet productive in preventing and reducing injury, while developing the strength needed to handle 200 plus pound (and heavier to 300 lb) opponents, as well as handle daily tasks like kindly helping buddies move easily.

I assume that if I can eventually shoulder a 250 to 300 lbs sandbag, for reps and sets, that I’ll have all the posterior chain and squat muscle strength needed to be equally or even stronger than those that use exclusively barbell, dumbbells or kettlebells as their primary strength methods.

So, what is your experience, knowledge and opinions on this approach of mine? I’m open to positive criticism with helpful advice and suggestions.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey all, hope everyone is having a great holiday. 

I've lurked here for a bit and have done a fair amount of my own research before starting the Recommended Routine. Unfortunately, right when I was getting into it in the fall (had a lot of time off while transitioning jobs) I ruptured my Achilles. 

Recovery has been slow and steady and I can put some weight on the leg now, but I think in general I'll be taking sports or anything with explosive movements off the table for 2022 until I get the confidence in my agility back. 

I'd like to get back into the Recommended Routine, with the caveat being that even exercises that don't directly exercise the leg still involve it in some way (getting up to or down from the pull up bar, contact with ground for push-ups, etc). Cardio is also out of the question for a little bit. My main motivation is looking good for my wedding in September (and of course, being healthier in general). 

Of course I'll be talking to my physical therapist about ramping up my activity level, but I wanted to see if this sub had any thoughts too as it generally seems to be one of the most helpful and supportive places I lurk on this website.

i have given myself the first three months of this year where i am not jumping into learning calisthenic skills but rather want to use these months to condition and strengthen my joints and tendons specifically wrists and ankles. i understand tendons and connective tissue take very long to get strong but i just need to get them strong enough to start the most basic progresssions.

i need guidance on how to do this. specific routines i shoudl follow and how many times a week. ifi this was you and you had three months to do this how would you go about it? been looking at potentially just using kinstretch PAILS/RAILS 2-3 times per week. or that GMB wrist routine daily? a bit lost to be honest.

"I've always had trouble making gains from exercise, but this level of regression is new even for me.

Background: 40M and thin. I did some GTG chin-ups earlier this year, getting to 5 max. Then I mostly stopped working out for half a year, until picking up kettlebells a couple months ago.

Two weeks ago, I got back to chin-ups, maxing out at 3 reps. Which was better than during my break, so the kettlebells must've helped here.

I did one day of 6 sets of 10 reps, where first set was 3 chinups + 7 negatives, and the remaining sets all negatives. 2 minute rests in between sets, and that was it for the day. Muscles were ANNIHILATED, which felt great! And sore for days. Behind my armpit (teres major?) the muscle was visibly super swollen quite a while, so I just gave it some rest, stretches and sauna.

However, despite 10 days of rest (with some active rest like jump rope and one round of kettlebells) as well as tons of protein and calories in the meanwhile, I couldn't get a single chin-up.

Gave it a few more days, and still the same story - first chin-up gets stuck halfway through.

Please tell me what exactly happened to my muscles here and what should I be doing instead, because this obviously isn't working.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hi,

So just some info on me to begin with. 175cm ~70kg and 22M. Been training with the rr for almost a year now. Went from 0 pullups to 12 solid reps on rings and from 12 really poor pushups to 20 pushups with solid form. I'm looking to start training with adding weight to these movements. But seeing as I have no experience with traditional strength training I'm not really sure how to program this.

I was thinking of doing a ppl split so that on each upper day I can focus all my energy into the weighted movement + some accessories. I was thinking something like this for the workouts.

Push: Weighted pushups, db ohp, some tricep isolation and additional shoulder work. (Lu raises and external rotation exercises)

Pull: Weighted pullups. Ring face pulls, ring rows, bicep curls, some forearm isolation too. Probably reverse wrist curls and finger curls.

With programming for the accessories, I have an idea of what to do. It's the weighted movements I'm unsure of. I plan on starting with 5kgs on each movement and seeing how it feels. But beyond that I'm not sure, other than my goal is building strength. Any advice would be appreciated!!","bodybuilding, fitness"

Important: I will continue to refine this post; so it may serve as a template you can use anytime.  If something is difficult to understand, please post here or direct message me.


Here is the first step I took that led me to exercising regularly from obesse to normalcy.

I used to be 30% body fat now I'm currently 14%.  Test I used was a basic caliper test.

So, those who wish to have an outline may study this one.

When and where?

Anywhere you can sit with privacy because being disturbed may bother your concentration.

I started with breathwork.  I learned to set a time for the day to do atleast ten minutes of it and another ten minutes before bed.  A total of twenty minutes a day.  Choosing to do it for atleast ten minutes started a wonderful daily routine.

Basic buteyko breathe work protocol

Wake up early.  Because you want some moments to yourself before you start the day.  For me it's two hours before work.

I wake up, I prepare my timer.  I sit down and relax and then do a breath hold and I then record it.

How to do the breath hold?

Prepare a timer (your cell phone)

Sit down and relax.  Get comfortable and time yourself 3 mins + to get oriented.  Then inhale normally exhale normally and hold your breathe.  Start the timer until the first sign of the urge to breathe.  This is when you want to inhale.  When that happens, stop the timer and breathe normally.

Noting that number, it'll be your first base number.  Then take 3 minutes to do reduced breathing, which is simply inhale normally and slowly exhale.  If you want a guide number 3s in 3-20s out.  No matter how you do that, the key is you can hear your breathing.

Checklist

Nose breathe
Can't hear the breathing
Stomach/side of ribs/back is moving for breathing.
Chest remains unmoving by shoulders not going up.
Imagine the body akin to a jug where the bottom is wide and the top narrow.

After this 3 minutes of reduced breathing.  Take 3 mins rest and then take the test again.  Inhale normally exhale normally then hold your breathe.  The goal is to hold atleast 2+ seconds more than the original.

If you improved.  You're done for the morning work breathing.  Do it again only as you need and before you sleep.

If not, go for at most 1 hour total for that morning.  Which is why I suggested 1-2 hours before you start your day.

Guide lines

If your breath hold is less than 10, focus on doing the 10 mins breathing every day morning and evening.  Or as needed.

Aim to get your breathold to 20+ from here the next activity is walking.

The idea is fairly the same, you do 3 mins relaxing take the CP, then do the breathold, but this time you walk and then time it. Once done, you take note.

Then you do 3 mins of reduced breathing and walking.  Which is simply inhale normally and exhale slowly.  The urge to breathe here will be stronger.  When the 3 mins is done, breath normally for 3 mins.  Then again take the breath hold.

Compare the base breathe hold to the one after walking.  And then see if you improved by 2.  If not repeat the process, but limit yourself at most 1 hour.

Walk 2 x a day.  And do the breathing as needed.

The goal here is again to reach 20+ walking breath hold.

When able to do 20+, you can apply it on jogging.

The same 20+ breathold goal.  And from there to running and then to sprints.

You can apply this for bodyweight circuits push pull legs.  To burpees pull up circuits.  And adapt it to other exercises.

My breath hold record for now is 55.  And it took a while to raise it there.  The higher your breathe hold, ideally, the healthier you are.  But don't get hang up on it.

The breath hold and reduced breathing takes advantage of the Bohr effect.  To help you distribute more oxygen to the body.

This is the activity that started my weight loss and path to getting healthy.

How I do it now?

Same,

I wake up, take the breath hold, and do the reduced breathing after I do my pull ups/dips/squats/burpees. Thru the nose.  And then take 3 mins to calm myself by normal nose breathing.  Then I do the next exercise. I finish the whole exercises and then at the end take the  breathold and see if I improved from the first or base breathe hold.

Shortcut template (gold information)

1. Relax 3 mins and breath hold.
2. Reduced breathing 3 mins (do after exercises i.e. burpees)
3. Relax 3 mins-15mins and breath hold

Begin with just breathwork, then walking, then running/bodyweights/sprints.

Bench mark.  -20 breath hold, stay at current exercise.
+20 breath hold, progress to the next exercises.

Repeat as needed.

Note:

Once you do sprints and bodyweight or weights once a day 3 x a week is enough, but the breathing exercise you do on your rest days instead of the exercises.

If you want to do random breatholds on the day just to pass time.  Inhale normally exhale normally and hold for 20s.  You can do this anytime, anywhere.  This is what I replaced my smoking with. Hehe

If you've got questions, please ask.  Or if you want a vid walk thru to do it, I we can schedule it sometime after new year.

"Hello I am 15 and I’m over weight

So cause if my fat there has been fat like on the back of my next causing bad posture and sole fat has also been forming at the back of my head to give my a weird shape like this https://imgur.com/a/aSKdhMb I have been doing exercises at actually lost a couple of pounds but what kind of exercise can I do to fix my posture is there anything I could buy ? Also if you can give me some advice to lose weight I would not mind also like what would you guys say I should do and eat at my age to become healthy oke of the thing I like about my self is that I like to eat  healthy stuff so a diet would not be to much trouble","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey so I'm pretty fucking confused. I just had a DEXAScan in a cheap hospital in a South American country.  The cost was around 40 dollars and the machine seemed really slow and they said I was too tall for the full body scan but eventually I did it anyway and they scanned everything except my feet to make up for that.

To get to the point I'm 30 y/o male under 21 BMI so around 20 BMI and it said I had 23.6% body fat and that my legs were 56% bodyfat. I have had a break from the gym that was pretty long but have gotten back and been working out 4-5 days a week the last 3 months and eaten lots of protein.

My first thought was, is it even possible to have 20 BMI (near underweight) with close to obese body fat? Mind that I have a super marked inwards going waist line, well defined face showing clearly all cheek bones, 4 pack visible when flexing my abs.

Sure I'm not super strong but I lift more than the average person my age and wtf Im like 20 BMI, for 5-8 reps max I can do the following: 30 kg per dumbell in dumbell bench press, 15-16 kg dumbells biceps curls, 6-7 wide grip pull ups going down to straight arms, 18-20 kg dumbell shoulder press.

Legs are a bit weaker where I only use 50 kg for squatting good form 6-8 reps so having higher bodyfat legs could make sense but 56% sounds a bit extreme on my BMI no?

When questioning this result some of their doctors tried to say that this is completely normal? That part is the most confusing one.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"When I looked this up I saw something called Russian dips but they aren’t quite the variant I’ve been trying out, but I was doing them all day at work since they wasn’t anything to do and my chest and triceps feel sore and they haven’t felt sore since I started doing regular dips.

The variation I saw was like starting with elbows and turn into a regular dip, but what I’m doing is literally pushing myself up and down with my elbows. There’s less range of motion but I feel it may be hitting certain areas regular dips don’t. Does anyone try something like this and if you do how beneficial you think it is compared to regular dips?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm interested in increasing the amount of pull ups i can do in one set. Most of the time i have done typical full body workout three times a week and i have done pull ups in every training. In these trainings i have usually done 3 sets of pull ups and tried to make same amount of reps each set (so the last set is close to failure). 

I have heard that one good way to increase the reps (in any excersize?) is to do pull ups nearly every day (like 5 times a week). This way you should do few sets but in each set you should avoid failure and leave few reps in reserve (this way you dont burn out your muscles every time you train and you are ready to do the same training session next day, if necessary). 

Is this something to try out or is it completely bs?","bodybuilding, fitness"

I don’t care for getting huge or shredded, just overall improving my fitness without going to a gym.

" When activating your core, not only do you suck your navel to your spine, but are you also supposed to flex and tighten down your abs after this motion or should I just keep my navel sucked in tight to my spine? I injured myself 14-15 months ago doing seated rows post deadlifts within my thoracic region due to poor posture and lack of core activation. In fact, I thought activating your core was simply just flexing your abs, so upon doing my seated row I curled my back too much flex my abs and got a nice little pinch in my thoracic region which irritates me at times to this day. Any time I lift now I tighten my gluteals and pull my navel into my spine to keep things nice and tight. I also have been focused on posture correction stretches/exercises.

"Hi all, just wanted to get a few opinions on something really quick so thanks for any advice. 

I’ve always been a bigger guy but I’ve always been on the weaker side, struggling with push ups, pull ups, mostly body weight stuff. Recently I’ve been trying to make better choices and I have a Genesis Health Club near me and they have a deal going on so the membership is only like $47 a month and I’ve been thinking about going and trying it out but I have two issues:

1. I’m worried I’m going to embarrass myself. Like I said, I’ve never been good with body weight stuff. I haven’t worked out in a few years either so I’m going to be starting from scratch. I don’t know what to do or how to do it and need a routine but that’s a whole other post for a whole other time.

2. Would it be worth the money? I really don’t want to get discouraged and end up paying for a year contract and not making use of it, but I also don’t know if I have the motivation to even start going let alone start working out consistently right now. Just kinda stuck stressing myself out about it.

Anyway, those are my questions/ issues, anyone with advice and/ or experience about gym going and motivation I’d be glad to hear it. Thank you in advance if you comment.

UPDATE - Thank you all for your thoughts, advice, and sharing your experience. I’m less worried about what others will think now but I’m still stuck trying to decide wether it’s worth the money or not yet lol, but that’s on me I’m just a really indecisive person. All I know for sure is I want to get in better shape and all of you have made some really good points about working out at home versus going to the gym and I really appreciate it. I’m going to try and go for a tour tomorrow and I’m try to remember to ask if they have like a free day or month trial thing to see if I can even stick to going before I get stuck in the contract. If anyone else has anything to add please do I’ll answer when I can. Thank you all again for your advice.

UPDATE PART 2 - I went in today for a tour and the place is overwhelming as hell lol. The building is huge on the outside and inside and anxiety hit right as I got out of the car. I felt really out of place. I ended up going in and getting a walk around the place and asked some questions. I found out some good news, they offer 3 free sessions with a personal trainer of your choice and I also don’t have to do a 1 year contract at all, I can sign up with just a monthly to see if I like it or not and all in all it’ll be anywhere from $50 and up depending on when I start because of a set up fee or something and the actual monthly payment. Just wanted to say thank you all once again for your advice and sharing your experiences. I think I’m going to go ahead and give it a shot. If I can remember to I might give a third update about if I’m sticking to it or not. Wish me luck lol. Thank you all again.","bodybuilding, fitness"
" 

I've always been a cold shower in the afternoon and hot shower at night guy. Cold shower for muscle recovery and shit (mainly to wake me up after nap) and hot shower to help me sleep better. But recently i found that most athletes cold shower after their workouts so i was wondering whether should i cold shower or hot shower after workout (forgot to mention my workout finish 3hrs before bed and after 1hr i do hot shower).

So here are the main benefits of both, for cold: muscle recovery, sigma male shit, for hot: relax muscle to sleep better, beta simp dickhead shit. Does better sleep(hot) > better muscle recovery(cold) or vice versa, or is there other factors to consider

Btw why does cold shower in the morning even help recovery, i mean you are starting the day to work, do you recover as you work??

Btw asking this cuz nobody seem to analyze the pros and cons or provide good science, only personal annecdotes. Also personally i sleep better with hot, be more awake, but perhaps performance in the gym would suck more than cold??","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hi everyone,

This year I decided to get my ass in gear and lose weight/improve fitness. Been a success so far and I've lost nearly 70 pounds. Mostly improved diet, cardio (exercise bike) and some light weights (100 pounds bench press)

My girlfriend has been very supportive and has bought me a punching bag for x-mas. I'm very happy with this and can't wait to start using it. 

I'm a beginner and don't want to start off wrong. I've been doing some research and found some contradicting ways to start.

"Hi! I've been doing this routine for a while now, tweaking things here and there as I see fit. My goal is primarily to build muscle.

**Upper body workout:**  
-warm up with some abs and sometimes skills (l-sit, tuck planche, handstand)  
-pseudo planche push ups with parallettes until failure / near failure.  
-superset with chin ups / pull ups until failure / near failure.  
-rest for 3 to 5 minutes  
-repeat for a total of 6 times.  
-dropset the last set with push ups and negative or static chin ups.  
-end up with abs.

I'm able to do around 12 pseudo planche push ups with a good lean in the first set, descending to around 6 on the last set. With chin ups I'm able to do around 8-9 the first set, descending to around 5 on the last set. I do slow and controlled chin ups. 

For **lower body** I'm not so structured but I usually do 6 sets of pistol squats until failure (around 9 or 10), some calf raises and abs.

**Weekly schedule:** upper, lower, rest, upper, lower, rest, rest.

Is this a good way to set up my calisthenics? What would you change?

Let me know! Thank you!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"L5’9” guy trying to get fit and bigger again at 21.

Already tried multiple times before but I can’t last more than 3 months before not finding the passion to do it.

I’m leaving for the US and tbh, I feel a bit insecure about myself. 

I’m very skinny and my shoulders are too narrow (14 inch biacromial width) and my deltoids are only about an inch away from the acromia).

I’m not looking for a greek god physique. Just enough to get some width and tone.

I’m about 50 kilos and the only thing I’m fine with is my waist since it’s very slim.

I find it really difficult to be consistent and it doesn’t help that I have Tourette’s and GERD. 

Tourette’s make it difficult for me since I have tics that put stress on my arms, back and neck and I twist nerves easily.

GERD makes it difficult for me to do dips and push-ups due to lack of oxygen since I find it hard to breath when I’m under stress.","bodybuilding, fitness"

Shaking isn't a big deal tho, I still can manage to do the exercise, but you know, it's a pain in my butt. It's like a fly who constantly annoys you.

Also, I read that drinking coffe might be a cause of all this, and I indeed, like to drink some coffe.

"I always see people posting sets and how much reps they do for each set but when I work out and do push-ups, pull-ups, core workouts and lunges etc. I was wondering is it okay to do workouts until muscle failure each and every time? I never really have a target number of reps in my head I just do it until my muscles can't do it no more and let's say if I'm doing a push-ups and I can't do anymore I will push as hard as I possibly can and stay in the one spot halfway through the push-up until my muscles give out is this good to do every time my workout or should I be aiming for a certain number of reps each time. I'm usually sore as all hell the next day or two after working out so I think that's a good thing but sometimes I need about two rest days just to feel back to normal and be able to go back at it.

I’ve been on a fitness journey for about a year now, I started with only cardio and slowly got into calisthenics and looked the best I ever did only a few months into my journey.

But I quickly realized that with my circumstances, getting to the gym really isn’t possible for me (which is okay!!) 
Moving on. I’ve decided to start my calisthenics journey again. My question is… 

How much can a girl change her body through only at home workouts/calisthenics? I’m feeling a little discouraged because I’ve not found anyone online with jaw dropping transformations or anything like that. 
My goal is to lose body fat and to gain some lean muscle mass. I don’t need to be a beef ball, that dream has died (maybe one day though) but to just achieve that healthy toned look throughout my entire body :)
I’d love to know about some female calisthenics influencers if y’all know of any!!!

"I have been doing callisthenics for a long while now. Until now I have been focusing on the hypertrophy rep range, honestly because I was a skinny-fat runt most of my life.

However, now I have seen some decent results, I've reached some more advanced progressions on some exercises and honestly... I don't feel like going for even harder progressions in some cases. There are some exercises that I just like, that feel good, that feel like the best bang for my buck or because further progressions feel overcomplicated. I was thinking in that case about just increasing the amount of reps in a set as a way of progressing. Also, I'd like to work on my strength-endurance and work capacity more, not just max strength and hypertrophy.

However, while I am OK with not making any more gains, I wouldn't want to loose too much of what I've already built. The question is - would going more into the endurance range *on exercises that I am already doing* lead to loss of muscle mass? Or just slower/no gains?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"After having a serious bout of covid back in August, I am still suffering from fatigue and  my appetite has increased to a ridiculous amount. I've always been lucky because genetically,  I have the gift of being able to put on muscle. But with that comes the downside of putting on fat pretty easily as well. I'm trying to get back down to my pre- covid weight of 220. Here's my story. I would appreciate any advice. I'm pretty open minded and have developed my workout and nutrition routine over years of trial and error. I'm 46 and male....

So pre-covid I was working out 6 times a week. My workout averaged out to 4 weight lifting sessions per week with cardio and 2 days of just cardio. My weight lifting regimen was 3 days of working just upper body and 1 day of legs. 
My upper body workout is as follows:
Chest- bench press or dumbell fly. 
Back- pull downs.
Biceps- standing barbell curls with the curved bar.
Triceps- pull downs.
Shoulders- reverse butterflies and overhead dumbell or machine press.
Also I do shrugs for shoulders/neck/back.
I also run between 20 to 30 minutes on those days.
For my legs once a week I do squats, calf exercises, hamstring curls, and the leg spreader machine which I don't remember the name. I usually run for 20-30 minutes on these days.
I also do 2 days of 30-40 minutes of running. I occasionally throw in the elliptical machine for 20 minutes as a substitute but this is rare.
I always hit the 150 minutes of cardio per week. In addition I do 2 sessions of karate of 90 minutes each but the intensity varies so I don't include it as that much of a workout. 
Post-covid I am usually always fatigued before I workout. Even first thing in the morning having eaten or fasted. I struggle through my workouts anyway and am keeping the same schedule. My appetite has increased a ridiculous amount. I'm always hungry. It's hard to keep on a 2000 calorie diet and I usually end up around 2500 to 3000 every day. (Side note is the brain fog and hair loss but that isn't relevant) To put it in perspective, I was 220 pre-covid and was 214 after covid. 3 months later I'm 240. 
Keeping the same routine but upping the weight since I've been eating so much,  I have increased all of my weights. My thinking is that if I have such an appetite I might as well put on muscle by increasing protein. As for my gains, rather than list them all, I'll just say I've increased my bench from 5 reps at 225 to 3 reps of 315 in the last 2 months. 
I want to get back down to 220. Any advice on possible workout or nutrition changes would be appreciated. I know that's a little vague but I think workout advice is always vague considering how different we can all be genetically. As a side note I've always struggled to find the right calories in/calories out formula and had settled at 2000 pre-covid but had plateaued at 220.

"Hello there, 

I'm looking for a new bar/station that allows me to do mainly pull ups and if possible dips or other upper body exercises. I need something that doesn't need to drill in the wall or attaching to the door frames.

For the moment I had a look on the BaseBlocks equipment like THE BIG BAR and also the B BARS, looking on the website and YouTube I see that this kind of equipment allow me to do a lot of exercises,  maybe the B BARS more than the BIG BAR.

Do you have any suggestion on this kind of equipment, available for shipping in EU?

In the past I had a pull up bar for door frames, sometimes used with rings, but never used a pull up bar that wouldn't allow me to stand with my legs dangling.

"Hello, I took some advice from my previous post about being stuck with ring pull-ups.

I used to go to failure for each set, now I do one day with my old failure mindset for hyperthrophy and one day for overall strength.

As far as I understood, it's ill advised to go to failure while doing strength training, but I feel like I can't push myself enough when I stop before failure.

I can get 4 reps with good form using 22lbs of added weight. I can pull that off for 4 sets. However, I don't feel like my muscles are fatigued. Am I supposed to feel this way?

Pushing for the 5th rep breaks my form, still not failure (maybe 2-3 more with half decent form in the tank). Should I crank that 5th rep? Thank you.

Edit: For reference, the ""good form"" is chest to bar (although bar doesn't exist in the current context since I use rings) while the ""half-decent"" form is slightly below that with a bit momentum involved.","bodybuilding, fitness"

I'm looking for a standing pull up bar for working out at home. The walls do not support a wall-mounted bar and the doors are all non-standard size.

"Hi there, I got interested in bodyweight fitness because of the skills you can learn. Currently I am aiming to learn handstands and muscle ups however I do not wish to neglect other areas of my body so I designed a push pull core(+legs) routine for myself. 

I spent few months bodybuilding so I have fair amount of strength for my body weight, benching more than I weight etc. I also noticed that bodyweight excercises are somewhat limited when it comes to legs so I will do weighted squats and leg machines for legs. 

The routine I came up with is based of the spreadsheet that my friend sent me from this sub (looks somewhat like a talent tree). I have main excersises followed by a ""-"" indicating things that I can do to make it harder or to diversify for the day. Also I start with the most advanced movement then move down to the simple one, for example I do archer pushups -> incline pushups -> regular pushups, etc.

"I am 47 and I’ve been doing the RR for 10 weeks now.

Ive been able to make good progression. When I started i thought id never get a pull-up, but I’ve gone from barely able to do scapular holds to 3x8 band assisted pullups in 10 weeks (I’ve made good progression on every exercise so far). I give a lot to the workout, I’m almost always struggling to get to my feet after the third pair of exercises.

I’m 185 cm and 88kg (190 lb or so ) and Ive been eating 3,400 calories a day (my TDEE is 3,100). I eat well, lots of whole foods, no refined sugar, 180 - 200 g of protein per day.

I just bought a digital scale (Withings) and it tells me that i have 23% body fat. I know that this may not be accurate, i could be 19-27%. However, my eyes agree, i can see lots of definition starting to show in my chest and shoulders, but i still have a belly.

What’s my best path forward if i want to look better? Should i

1. Stick with the RR and eat 3,400 and hope the fat burns and muscle grows?
2. Add some cardio to burn more fat (leaving me more tired/time poor)
3. Eat at 3,100 and continue RR
4. Eat at 2,700 and continue RR

I know that every person is different, so I’m looking for any general recommendations.

Thank you for reading.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi! I'm 17F, and can't even do a single proper KNEE pushup, I used to workout  time to time but I'm not consistent, this year I started with a 21 day stretching challenge, and also along with it I'm planning to practice and achieve proper regular push-ups this month 

I read somewhere to start with tabletop push-ups and that's what I've begun to do, after 2 days of being able to do them, I tried and was able to do 2 knee push ups but then after that day I don't know why, I couldn't even hold a proper knee pushup. I just collapse before getting back up.

Advice on how to achieve a proper regular pushup?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey! My mom just turned 58, shes still pretty healthy and walks atleast 30-40 minutes 5 days a week (walks home from work every day). And sometimes longer walks on the weekends. She is not obese or severely overweight, just some extra lbs and some excess belly fat which obviously not great. And she has not lifted weights (ever) or had any form of resistance training in many many years.

She has gained some weight in the last few years and would like to lose some. I've calculated her macros and will help her plan her meals and learn to count calories somewhat as I am still living at home for another 6 months before going to Uni after the summer, I'll make sure she gets some more protein aswell! Hopefully I can get her started abit while I'm still at home. She asked me for tips, or if we could start slowly every weekend with some bodyweight exercises together both for health and for bonding time.

I am not quite sure where to start? Before doing any added weights I'll tell her the importance that we go get a clear from a doctor first which I would recomend anyone at any age. I assume some cardio, and the regular push pull and leg/hinge exercise is beneficial at any age? Like pushups (starting easy against a table or wall). Maybe getting up from a chair in the start and transitioning into squats/lunges, and maybe some row movement? Other than that I was thinking some yoga or just light stretching. But I would really love some tips or guidance from anyone with more experience, I only started exercising regularly a couple years ago myself but have been doing pretty well myself, however I am in my 20's and I assume it's quite different?

I have built like a mini gym at home during Covid, we have access to dumbells, a barbell, squatting rack, bench, resistance bands, pilates ball and yoga mats, and a pull up bar.

Is there anything I should avoid? Or any signs that we should move onto something else, and some things to keep in mind, like soreness not going away after a few days?

Thank you in advance!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I am planning to buy a power tower, fill a backpack with weights, and progressively overload on pull-ups, dips, and pistol squats (the ""calisthenics big three""). How dumb would it be if I only did these exercises at 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, 3x per week? Maybe throw some leg raises in there for abs? My main goal is hypertrophy, not strength.


I would consider myself an intermediate trainee (been doing a mix of calisthenics and bodybuilding for the past few years) and just want something simple yet effective to make gains while I'm out of the gym. I have ran the recommended routine for a while in the past, but I prefer the simplicity of just adding weight to the basic movements.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi everyone, so I'm training for the one arm chin up, I do one finger assisted Chin ups on rings and Mantle Chin ups on rings (assisting ring lower). However with Mantle Chin ups I completely stopped progressing because I just can't pull high enough with my right arm. I don't know if it's normal, with my left arm I can pull till my chin is above the whole ring but with my right, I can barely get my chin above the bottom of the ring. What are the best Chin up progressions that I could replace the Mantle Chin up with? Archer Chin ups? Or should I do weighted Chin ups to build more strength? That would be limited though, because I train at the park and would have to carry weights in a backpack.","bodybuilding, fitness"

Few years ago I started to run and sprint as a workout and lost upto 30kgs doing that in alternative days but life happened and I couldn't keep working out as I used to this lead to me feeling depressed and overeating, I started gaining the weight that I lost and it came back with a vengeance , I am now 118kg...


I want to get healthy. I want to do bodyweight workouts as it seems to be more my style than going to a gym , I am not able to go to gym due to time constraints. Weight training also isn't something I could see myself doing for a long time.
I am interested in bodyweight workouts as it seems to be more easy going for me and something that I could do for a long period of time to yield the desired results.


The results I am looking for is physical as well as mental, as losing weight and being in a better shape would help me feel less of a burden and studies have shown that people suffering from anxiety get improved quality of life if they integrate workouts in their daily routine.

I need your guidance in learning what's a good place to begin doing it as a overweight man, I am asking this so don't start working out things that are better for fit people and end up damaging my joints, muscles.


My current fitness level if it helps is following
I can hold a plank for upto 1 minute, 35 squats
My second question is about push-ups.
I have tried doing one but I can't seem to lower myself down , I have tried doing knee push-ups but they present the same situation , I have tried doing wall push-ups with 40x3 but still I saw no improvements at all.

"Hello, I've been seeing strength gains in my pullups and dips, but it's not helping me with endurance at lower weight. For instance I started doing dips with 35 lbs a few months ago I would be able to 7-8 in a row but in the next set I could only do 4-5 sets. I assumed the problem was my strength so I started doing more strength training, and stopped hypertrophy training for approximately 2 months. My 1 rep max now on dips is 95lbs and 40lbs with pullups. However im going back to the lighter weight and still hitting the same reps. The funny thing is though the lighter weight does indeed feel alot lighter then it used to, but my endurance hasn't changed at all. Do any of you know what's wrong, I know alot of solutions, but I can't find a solution for this problem at all. If you know what I can do to fix this please let me know.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi!

I am doing the RR, and would like to start working towards the wall-supported handstand push-ups (new year resolution... :))

I am doing handstand as part of my skill work, before the strength work, every workout.

I would also like to start doing pike push ups to build the strength towards handstands. However, I am not sure where to place them in the RR. They are not skill-only, and they do not seem to be focusing on the chest as much as ring pushups or pseudo-planche (please correct me if I am wrong!). 

The only idea is to replace dips (I am at 3x8 there, 3x6 if I use rings).

What would you suggest?

"Hi all!

I have a question that has been in my head for a few days now... I want to try and grease the groove with weighted pull-ups (+10kg), I have a vest at home and a pull-up bar so it is easy to do. My max is around 11 but I'm starting gtg with 4 reps I think, if that's the wrong approach please let me know!

So I also do like a full upper body workout once every 5 days or something, where I do several back and chest exercises, including inverted rows and pull-ups/chin-ups. Is it possible to combine this with grease the groove? Like do the upper body workout on Monday, Tuesday rest and gtg from Wednesday till Saturday or something and do the upper body day on Sunday again, or is this not smart at all to do?

Or is it better to drop my pull-up exercise from the upper body day?

"Hi, so I just got into fitness and nutrition recently as I want to lose about 10-12 kilos. I am calorie counting using MFP and aim to eat (as healthily as i can manage) around 1500-1600 calories daily (TDEE 1800) and jump rope 30 mins a day (30 secs on, 30 secs off and repeat 30 times) 3-4 times a week.

But I want to incorporate resistance training to improve strenght and build lean muscle and since I already have calisthenics equipment, I wanted to start resistance training along with jump rope.

The thing is, the RR is very long and I want to do something sustainable long term so I wanted a shorter routine to start out. I plan to do this on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and my jump rope workouts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays with complete rest on Sundays. Please critique this and help me build a good routine:

3×6-12 reps high incline pushups

3×6-12 reps rows

3×6-12 reps squats

3×6-12 reps chair dips

3×6-12 reps lunges

3× 30-60 sec plank holds

"So, I have decided to try and get off my lazy ass and try and at least start doing some exercise. I'm 19M and haven't really done any physical activity the last 7 or 8 years. Maybe the occational try on some pull ups or simething to see if I could do them.


I started climbing at a local gym that opened earlier this year, but not nearly often enough to be called working out or whatever. I have been maybe 10 or so times this year. As well as maybe once a week trying an L-sit and some pull ups to see how long/many I could do. Just a single try.


So I like setting goals, like checking off things on a list, even if it is not the most efficient say of doing things. I don't really know what is realistic, as I don't want to set a goal that is uber ridiculous. I thought I wanted to go for some amount of L-sit, 3 muscle ups and then 1 or 2 more exercises that I don't know what should be yet.


Currently I have been able to hold an L-Sit for 20 second, though I'm shaking quite a bit as well as ~8 pull ups with what I think is ok form. As for the L-sit, whay s realistic? I couldn't find much info on how long is long. Some YT videos of people doing ~1 min on the floor or 2 min hanging from a bar. Then this lady who apparently held it for like 7 minutes or something on the floor. Which just made me even more confused as to what to aim for. And the 3 muscle ups where inspired by Mike Boyd.

The only way I can get anywhere close to getting my elbow angle to 90 degrees is by leaning forward a lot.  I can feel my shoulders 'shrugging' upwards as I do this, presumably meaning I'm not keeping my scapulae fixed in position.  I realise this is bad form and I will continue to work on support holds for strength, but is a lack of shoulder extension whats holding me back here?

I youtubed some shoulder exercises and they all talk about importance of keeping the scapula retracted and depressed but this is very difficult.
Can anyone recommend me your favourite shoulder exercises and any cues to keep scapula position correct?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I’m a trans guy, 19. i’m roughly 200 and 5’9”, and i’m okay keeping it that way! i’ve been on T for nearly a year now, and heard about how easy it is to gain muscle mass and get “beefy” on t. however, i’ve tried working out and eating right but i can never quite get it to beef me up in the way men do. i really want to look like those body builders who are really strong as in “bara” if that makes sense, but if i DO get muscles, it all shows up as a slimmer waist and i slim down, which is not exactly what i want. if i try downing protein and then exercising, my chest gets bigger as does my stomach, which is ALSO not the desired outcome. the diet part i think i have down, it’s just the workouts. are there workouts i can do that will help strengthen my core, get stronger physically, etc, but NOT slim my waist or increase my mass in my chest and stomach?

I’m at a pretty low level of fitness right now so I’m just looking for some more short term goals that are kind of under each exercises’ umbrella. For example, like 15 pull ups and 10 dips before aiming to actually do a muscle up or changing to explosive pull ups.

It's been working pretty well, so far.  But I can't do things like the Steam Engines due to a badly healed hip injury.

I've been doing basic squats instead, which I technically can do.  But they still feel pretty bad, mostly due to the screws in my hip.

"I want to see what everyone’s opinions are on the front lever row for full range strength training, specifically scapular retraction.

I value the FL row due to its crossover to static FL and as a counterbalance to horizontal pushing work.

But recently as I’ve been working on fixing some postural issues (rounded shoulders, scapular winging, impingement) I’ve noticed how the FL row doesn’t allow full ROM (range of motion) because it is almost impossible to properly retract during the movement. 

My pull work pretty much revolves exclusively around FL work and chin-ups. But neither of these movements build scapular retraction (am I correct?). So does that mean that your average calisthenics push-pull program  (assuming mine is average) is not effectively balanced since it never allows for full scapular retraction training?

"Here's 3 examples of heavy weighted one arm passive hangs:

1. [\+120 kg one arm passive hang (19Kamau79)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAdLii79cn0&ab_channel=19Kamau79)
2. [ \+100 kg one arm passive hang (Adam Raw)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1JBx2Mm9e8&ab_channel=AdamRaw)
3. [\+100 kg one arm passive hang (Meckanimal)](https://youtu.be/GxJ_B6p216w?t=96)

This proves to me that weighted one arm passive hanging is relatively safe for the shoulders. However, what would happen if I trained weighted one arm *active* hangs instead (or weighted one arm 'scapular pull ups')?

By 'one arm scapular pull ups' I mean [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w14o5qECZJg&ab_channel=Littlebeastmtraining), but adding extra weight,  and performed dynamically (for reps) instead as a hold, for the goal of gaining scapular depression & retraction strength (1-5 reps/set) which I guess would be useful for:

1. **Carryover to weighted pull-ups / one arm pull-ups / front lever**. After all, scapular pull-ups are the initial motion of deadhang pull-ups (right before bending the arms), so getting stronger in that position will make the pull-up motion stronger in that specific ROM. They're also the initial motion of a [front lever raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alqj0dHg3-4&ab_channel=DanielDii), so it might carryover to front levers as well
2. **Overall shoulder health / injury prevention:** Passive hanging is good for stretching the shoulders tissues, and active hanging is good for strengthening lower traps and overall shoulder stability. So combining the two movements dynamically ('scapular pull-ups') would provide the specific benefits of both variations.
3. **Improved grip strength/endurance**, which would carryover to any pulling exercise.

So the benefits are clear: basically scapular retraction & depression strength + some grip bonus. What I'm not so sure about is how high are the potential risks when training one arm scapular pull-ups with extra load. [This is an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSTqlujE9sw&ab_channel=MSKNeurology) of someone explaining risks of pulling scapula back and down (retraction + depression). So the questions are:

1. What kind of injuries am I likely to get when training weighted one arm scapular pull ups? Maybe shoulder impingement, or even a labrum tear?
2. Or is the motion very safe and thus completely worthwhile to train it from a benefit vs risk ratio perspective?

"Hi.

I will get to the point:

Is it possible to increase pushup reps while building muscle? If so how, like what methods could I possibly use?

I currently do hypertrophy workouts for chest, shoulder and tricep, and I was wondering if I can increase my pushup count while not lowering the amount of muscle I could _possibly/potentially_ build? How can I do this, i.e. should I do hypertrophy and endurance in a workout? Or keep a routine of 1 endurance and 2 hypertrophy per week?

So, basically I want to still be able to build as much muscle as possible while being able to increase my reps.

OR should I do Grease The Groove instead and keep doing hypertrophy workouts, as I want to bring my reps from 40 to 60-70+? I have heard a lot about it and that I has brought some excellent results.

Thanks a lot!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello calisthenics athletes, I'm currently doing 4 sets of +5kg weighted pull ups (aprox. 10 reps) and trying to improve both numbers and/or weight, whatever comes first.

Is this a good approach for harder exercises later on? Just checked and exercises like archer and typewriter pull ups seem to be harder than my shoulders-width weighted pull ups, mainly because the former two use the lats more compared to the later.

Is this a good way of training? Taking into account muscle ups and front lever, which are even more advanced exercises, need more strength and technique.

So what do I do? Do I keep pushing for more strength or should I do a combination of sets? Weighted set + wide grip set + chin up set + archer set, etc?

The same applies to other exercises like dips (weighted dips vs russian and imposible dips) push ups (HSPU vs archer/one hand push ups) and so on.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hello, i am currently doing the recommended routine with weight, i train with a 14 Kg vest (30.86 Lb?) and i currently perform 2 pull ups, 7 dips, 5 psuedo planche push up (i really doubt that with a good form, but without weigths maybe) and bulgarian split squat 8.

&#x200B;

I had gained a lot of strength doing this, but recently i was playing futball (i do not do any sport apart calisthenics) and i saw a bar and can not resist to do pull ups, a couple of co workers give me positive feed back, i never think in training to perform tricks or something, just for health, but this event encorage me to maybe learn some basic tricks.

The bad thing is that i do not know anything, besides the recommended routine i do not know how to start to practice tricks.

Some ideas or sugestions? i perform the rr 3 times a week (almost) and i really do not know if i could extend my training period more that 30 minutes more (i workout in the morning, maybe could do two routines one in the morning and one in the evening) so i was thinking in just ""play"" trying to achive the basic progression of certain tricks before the rr routine (planche, front lever and handstand), is this rigth? maybe perform or practice the tricks in the days i do not do the rr, but of course that leads to no rest time, or maybe just one day of tricks but that could slow down the trick progress.

any adice would be welcome, and also, i have some fat in the waist, maybe it is hormonal (i am 31 years old), but it will be a good idea to add cardio in the rest days?

Typically I set out a program and on some days I do what I set out. Sometimes I modify based on how I'm feeling. Some sets I record reps, others only video. Sometimes I exercise with a goal in mind, sometimes I'm being playful. All said, I built this and tweaked it until it was flexible to handle all the scenarios I find myself in. 

I would love your feedback. I would love to see your your fitness tracking methods.

"Hi guys, so as the title says, I have been struggling with my handstand progress.

 I started a few months back and at first the progress was coming really fast. 

The thing is, I always only did chest to wall handstands, as I'm terrified of the kickup, which I'm aware is an issue. 

I'm probably an intermediate and strength Is definitely not an issue, however the balance is. At the beginning of my handstand training, I basically measured how far my hands are from the wall everytime and progressed that way.

 After a while I got to a point where my hands are at about one hand away from the wall. Since then I tried to improve my balance and get my feet away from the floor, and I did - a couple times for just seconds. 

Sometimes I found the balance but immediately fell back because of fear of falling forward. Lately I also feel like I'm using way too much strength in the handstand and have zero balance and awareness. I can't seem to get my alignment right either. 

I feel a lot of preassure on my shoulders and I'm not sure if that's normal.
 I always do my handstands on the wall for 45 seconds for 4sets, resting 2 minutes between.
 I do them after my warm up and before my push workouts, which I do twice per week. 

Should I start practicing handstands more often? I never did because after push sessions I would always be sore and I feel like it would limit my handstands a lot. 
Also it seems like handstands are interrupting my hypertrophy workouts, which I mainly focus on.
 Today I felt very weak after handstands and incline pike push ups were almost impossible with proper form. 

What is the fastest way to progress and get away from the wall? How many times per week should I train the handstand, since I'm focusing on hypertrophy training? I will appreciate any tips.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"So for 6 sets, each are different variety of pushup (diamond, wide etc), then the seventh and 13th sets i start the cycle over again for another 6 variety. Each set consists of maxed out reps (till exhaustion). So my question is, is 18 sets too much? I do these everyday. But I'm wondering at what point will it become more muscle endurance than actually building muscle, which is what I'm actually after. The reason I do 18 sets is because on the 12th set my triceps are dead but my chest is not that worked. But by the 18th set I can feel my chest is worked but my triceps are completely spent and feel like they're going to blow up. But I mean I want to get both equally spent so don't know what to do here..?","bodybuilding, fitness"

I don’t have access to a gym currently, and I need some good at-home exercises to help tone my chest! I have decent endurance so I just need something that’s efficient and possible in my situation! Bonus if it doesn’t require any equipment at all!

Currently I’m just doing several sets of traditional push-ups and diamond push-ups, but I can’t help but think that there are much better exercises for the chest that I’m just not aware of.

I’ve never been a gym person, so I’ve always just exercised by running, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups and the sort of old school “gym class” stuff. It’s kept me very fit but I definitely want to tone my body more!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi all, I am wondering what is the best way of incorporating rock climbing during the week if I am doing the recommended routine (RR) as per the suggested 3x a week. My thinking is that if I am doing the RR 3x a week, then any additional working out, such as rock climbing, during the week would lead to overuse injuries. I really enjoy rock climbing and I also enjoy doing the RR so I appreciate any advice on how to do both. A couple strategies I can think of is alternating between just rock climbing one week and just the RR the following week, or doing the RR one to two times a week with rock climbing one to two times a week. My main concerns are that I will progress slowly towards my calisthenics goals or I will end up with unbalanced body strength by too much pulling exercise (from the rock climbing).

"First of all sorry for my shitty english.

I want to share my experience with the so called Sky Mentorship from Dominik Sky and warn others of this potential scam.

Some time ago I found this Sky Mentorship on YouTube and thought, why not giving it a try. The mentorship was supposed to be a personalized guide from experts.

So I had an appointment with one of their ?staff? Let's call him James. (can't remember his name. I think it wasn't his real name anyway). We met in Zoom and we talked for 1 hour. First James wanted me to talk about my training experience and my current problems in calistenics. I explained my situation, the typical plateau in like everything and how my current routine looks like. After that, James gave me an overview of their 'service'. Individual training routines, why my routine was trash and why I am stuck on this plateau. 

At the end, he made an offer (verbally). If I'd pay 1.700 €, I would have gained access to all the things he pointed out earlyer for life time. But due to their full schedule they couldn't offer individual support but access to 'all the knowledge Dominik has' with videos. This would have costed me only 1.500 € BUT this offer was a one time chance. Also there was only one chance. If I delince this offer, they won't come in contact with me in the future. I had to decide in this moment. He gave me a link via Zoom to the payment. 1.500 € with Paypal.

All this made me think because it seemed weird and here is why:

\-In my opinion the price is absurd. Think about it. Where I life, a normal gym membership with trainers and all the other stuff and staff costs 30€ per month. That's a bit more than 4 years of membership if you summ it up to 1.5k

\-I had no valid information about getting my money back, If I won't like it. He said for one month I had guarantee. For sure...

\-They use my personal training issues as bait. It's a clever strategy to stick to the emotions to make them (the victims) taking the bite.

\-Reduce the price to make it a bit more comfortable.

\-Put pressure on the victims by the ultimatum of a limited offer.

\-No real contract. Just words.

\-I didn't know who I was talking to. I had his voice and his fake name.

\-They promised individual support but suddently they are busy and can only offer videos. For real?? There are enough videos out there already. What does Dominik know what others don't?

&#x200B;

I didn't want to pay immediately because I was't convinced and needed some time to think about it. So he gave me another appointment 3 days later. That's not a thing they normally do, he said again. But I got time to wrap it up and decide to not take the bite.

So far, I didn't find any information of other people that have tried the Sky Mentorship. I'm pretty sure it's a scam. If I'm wrong, they need a more serious way of selling stuff.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"I have a lot off experience with powerbuilding it was my main workout source before Corona. When everything closed I turned to calesthenics. With this I had a lot more progression in how I look(probably also had to do with there being no parties). Now back to today the gym is back open. Now i'm twisted so much between the two that I asked myself if others blended them.

First some personal pro's and cons 

Pro's calesthenics:
* You train everything even small muscles like stability in your wrist or grip strength. 
* Training sessions are usually much shorter with same exhaustion of the muscles afterwards (how I felt it)
* It's like cardio and strength training in one
* You do have more functional strength

Cons:
*Training chest is difficult because after dips exercises become more difficult in stability and schouder rotation strength then pure pec strength like planche.
*Leg training is also hard because when you reach pistol squats. The only good ones are jumping squats and pistol squats.

Pro's powerlifting:
*With squats and deadlifts your posture is rock solid. Which has benefits for a lot off aspects in my life.
*You do get really strong and feel powerfull. But only on certain lifts
 
Cons: 
* If you want to train everything you are busy for 90 minutes or more 
* I often forgot wrist strength and now my wrist sometimes hurt when using them to much
* If you don't know how to balance your workouts you often have unbalanced physique(a lot off insecurity in self made programs)
* Full body is also difficult because in a single workout you train every muscle but not as it should (back: only vertical or horizontal pull. One of the 2 is missing)

Also research on adding calesthenics in gym workouts always leads to pure calesthenics, not with added lifts of the big 5.

So I was wondering if any of you have a calisthenics workout with added big lifts?

These coaching cues have helped my clients and I make consistent progress, PAIN FREE. It helps reinforce good posture, as we often sit a lot with rounded shoulders. If you're looking to build a stronger, thicker back, keep these cues in mind!  


🌟 Practice without the rings first - extend your arms out and hold your fists.  
🌟 Think ""shoulders away from ears"" or ""pack your shoulders to your back pockets"". Then think ""squeeze shoulder blades together and open chest"". Try to keep this posture during your set. \*\*  
🌟 When you pull, aggressively pull your elbows back. Imagine someone owing you money but refuses to pay back, and you're elbowing them in the gut! 😤

"Hi everyone ! 

I'm planning to loose some weight for the next month (I don't have much hope but I'll try anyway aha) and for this time I only have floor, rings and my beloved family countryside. I've made a light workout session that I could do 5/6 times a week that I plan to pair with a light 5/6k run. So I'm just not sure how to proceed with the routine. 

I know I want to execute right in the morning before eating anything but from there I don't know if I should go with the running session or the workout first. 
With the run, I'm really waked up and aware when I start the workout but I'm already out of gas and will struggle a bit in rep ranges I would not without the run. 
With the workout I'm in theory at maximal strength capacity but I'm very hard to ignite in the morning and it would be a struggle for like the first half of the workout and I also will breath heavy at a much lower pace in the run following. 

I think that's a workout I can do even with a run before, like for the ring pullups it's a 4 sets drop (15-14-13-12) where my max is around 4/3 of the biggest set (19~20reps) but I'm not sure about how the run could negate in a way the workout being right after.

I'm probably not the only one who does this.  But I bet some time in your life you've had cramps in the soles of your foot, especially if you didn't warm up properly.

I find doing this as a finisher for leg exercises good.  Squishing the stress ball with your foot.

Good for swimming, track and field, or sports where you need to move on your toes much.

Doesn't take much to get to hypertrophy.  Just be sure to have somewhere to sit.

2-3 x a week

You'll see the difference once you've started on it.  Less cramps and you can claw in the floor with your toes more.

Strengthen those toes.

Same applicable with the fingers.

Note:

Below is my plan, any help and advice is greatly appreciated!

PUSH-UPS

I aim to do 5 sets of 20 push-ups as a benchmark to know that I'm ready to do 60 in a single set. Is this an advisable number of reps? My plan is to do 5 sets of push-ups every day, increasing the reps every week until I achieve the desired number.

"So I've decided to go on a little journey called 'planche', the last major obstacle before I can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete. And I've given myself 4 months to do it.

This is where I'm currently at (filmed end of December): https://streamable.com/fkzlbt

That was about RPE 7. Right now my balance gives out before my strength does (can't even do a proper headstand for more than 8 seconds, another thing I will be working on), but I fully understand that my shoulder, chest and back strength is going to need a massive upgrade to pull this off.

So why 4 months? Because that's what works best for me. I got my first iron cross after 4 months of specific training. Anything longer than that and I tend to burn out and regress, so 1/3 of a year for a strength training cycle is the best I can do.

My 4 month training cycle will go from being about 40/60 strength/hypertrophy that it is now to about 80/20 strength/hypertrophy, doubling my strength training volume. Basically, I'll be training as a power lifter.

I will also be working heavily on the antagonist muscles to avoid postural imbalances, which means I'll also be training heavy for front lever and p-bar victorian, but after I do my planche block in the training session.

This will be the first time I share my calisthenic training journey with anyone and I mainly wrote this post to hold myself accountable (so no slacking off!!) and maybe get some tips and support from you guys. I'll be doing monthly updates until month 4, so stay tuned.

"I've used a multitude of workout tracking apps for my gymnastics ring training as well as tradition gym training, the first one I got worked okay for about 6 months, but then one day all my data was just gone. Next I used ""Strong"" and I still use it to this day to track every workout, but the only shortcoming is that I found myself getting so involved in the details of every rep, set and exercise that it was hard to focus on the bigger picture: training each muscle frequently, and with adequate training volume, specifically I wanted to make sure I trained each muscle at least twice per week with a certain amount of sets for each muscle group.

At first I just used a spreadsheet, but after a few weeks, I kept thinking that it just wasn't very convenient or user friendly to have to open a spreadsheet, tap to open the keyboard, type something in, dismiss keyboard and repeat for each muscle group as I trained, I wanted something that wouldn't distract me from my workout, because tracking my sets and reps in strong was already enough of a distraction.

So I made ""Built Training Log"" pretty much entirely to solve my own problem, however I now see that it could be of use to much more people.

Link: https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1576488381?pt=123286328&ct=bodyweightfitness&mt=8

It's basically a grid of 3 state buttons with muscles or exercises on the Y axis and the 7 days of the week as the X axis, with a sets column on the end to make sure you get enough training volume. First you plan out your week by tapping all the muscles / exercises you want to do on each day, then during your workout, all you have to do is tap to fill in the planned blocks after you've completed all sets for each muscle group / exercise.

Tracking my training has been a breeze ever since I finished this app so I hope others find it just as useful as I do.

Not sure if this is against the rules or not, just wanted to share this because I think it could make a lot of peoples lives easier when it comes to tracking workouts.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Maybe I missed it but I couldn’t find a thread of “peak week” strategies. There seems to be a big variance of what people do during the week before the show.  It seems to vary widely from changing nothing to extremely complicated dehydration, diet, and drug protocols. I’m curious for those who have competed what they thought was the most effective peak week strategy for them.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I run an Upper/Lower Split that is basically the RR splited in two, but with more volume for legs on Lower days.

For each Upper day, I picked different progressions that allow me to work on different rep ranges.

So, on Upper 1, I aim on low reps(1-6):
- One Arm Chin Up progression
- Planche Push Up progression
- Front Lever Row progression
- Ring Iron Cross progression

On Upper 2, medium reps (6-10)
- Archer pull ups
- PPPU
- Archer Rows
- RTO Ring Dips

An lastly, on Upper 3, high reps
- Pull ups
- Push Ups
- Inverted Rows
- Dips

I do 3 sets of each exercise each day.

Does this kind of weekly periodization make any sense?
Or is it better to just stick with one kind of training for a given period of time?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi! Can someone in a really simple way explain the best workout routine for building muscle mass using only bodyweight exercise and light dumbells, sliders and a booty band? 
I have tried to research but a lot of the articles confuse me with their fitness terms such as volume and so on.

Also to add a bit about me i have tried a lot of different home workouts, and i enjoy pilates and yoga the most and hiit the least. I am not a fan of super high intensity exercises or high rep ranges, so something in between would be ideal. As for cardio i hate running, but love walking/hiking/dancing.


Example i would understand: “to grow muscle you should do 3-5 sets of 10-12 reps for 3-4 exercises that targets the muscle - this should be done x times per week”

"hello guys. so after predominantly weight training my entire life im slowly moving towards bodyweight styles of training, or rather, incorporating bodyweight fitness into my training,

i have decided to invest in a pair of rings which i very excited about. having never owned/ used a pair of rings before i had some questions

firstly: im a small guy with small-sized hands. should i just go for the fig standard 1.11 thickness or the larger 1.25. as i said before i do have smaller hands and assuming the thinner ring will be more comfrotable, but just wanting to know from other individuals. for the time being i am leaning towards the 1.11 thickness

secondly: how long should the straps be? the plan will be to hang the rings of a power rack pull up bar approximately 8ft high. currently im looking at the rogue wood rings which come with a 16' strap. would that be adequate to lower it to a height comfortable for dips and push ups or do i need something longer?

thanks guys. any info is much appreciated","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hi,

34M, 5’7” (170cm), and \~152lb (69kg).  I’ve been working out on and off for 16 years without any real guidance.  Currently, I only have access to a pullup bar, so I am doing bodyweight exercises for now.  I have three goals--the immediate ones are to lose weight to get a visible six pack and to increase the number of weighted pullups/chinups I can do, and my longer term goal is to gain as much muscle as I can (hypertrophy).  The FAQ “Is My Workout Good?” section indicates that a good routine “Doesn't include high rep situps or crunches,” so should I break up my 3-100 rep sets of crunches into more sets of fewer reps?  I use a calorie tracker.  I rest every other day.  I’m thinking about adding the Front Lever in one of the days, and, soon, I’m going to do 2 sets each of weighted pullups and chinups, decreasing the regular pullups and chinups to 3 sets each.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve my program, I would be most appreciative. 

**Day 1: Pull Day**

10 weighted pullups \~16lb (7kg) weight

10 weighted chinups  \~16lb (7kg) weight

"Hello there, I'm not sure if it's the right sub to post this, so feel free to redirect me.

**Context: **

I'm a 23yo guy, been climbing for a few years, but always seeked a balanced type of physique. Thus I always end a climbing session with a full body workout, and I run on my off days. 
I recently read ""overcoming gravity"", and became even more interested in balancing my workouts. This book answered a lot of questions regarding bodyweight fitness. 

However by doing a few spartan races, I noticed, not surprisingly, that I struggled with weights. My legs shake a bit, and I don't feel very confident in these obstacles. I think of the spartan races as a recap of my overall fitness. So weighted obstacles being a big weakness, I thought that maybe implementing a few weightlifting exercices into my routine would help me fill this gap. I was thinking about deadlift, bench and maybe squats.

Now, **by no means do I want to be a world class climber, break running records or become a strongman.** I just want to be a balanced athlete, with no big weakness that could lead to injury. Weightlifting and bodyweight training as I see them are tools that could help me reach that goal.



So I was at a gym earlier today, this place has a great boulder area, as well as an area with multiple pull up bars, and also a few ""cages"" for weightlifting. Coaches there are either specialized in bodyweight training or weightlifting.
I climbed a bit, then went into a bodyweight workout, and then, as I felt still pretty fresh, asked a coach to help me learn the technique for deadlifts since I've never done those.
He basically said it was useless for my practice, and could even deteriorate my running and climbing game.

**Hence the question : is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone trying to be balanced ?**","bodybuilding, fitness"
"***TL;DR: How do put on weight without putting cholesterol at risk besides eating more? And what exercises can I do to build a bit of tone?***

As an insight, I'm 15 years old and I do a lot of road cycling. Despite that, I have a high-ish cholesterol (I'm certain it's genetical because the majority of my father's family have high cholesterol and/or diabetes). I'm 50kg and can't seem to change that at all, even before I started cycling so much.

***How do I put on weight overall without putting myself at risk of cardiac issues from my cholesterol?***

Yes I eat a lot; as much as I can - I carbload before big rides and I eat plenty of protein (that'll reduce a bit in the new year for cholesterol purposes). I don't eat much fruit because it's so expensive here but I eat a good amount of veg. I've been recommended by my GP to not use protein supplements because I'm still growing so that's not an option. Nutrition on the bike consists of carb/oat bars, gels and sweets. I have alright core strength from cycling but everything is really skinny and ugh.

***What exercises would you recommend to build a bit of muscle on my arms and chest?*** not looking to get hench, just gain a bit of tone to not look too lanky. With school and guitar and cycling, I don't have the time or money to go to a gym.

Any help is appreciated. seems like one thing has a knock-on affect with another and another for me.

"Hi gang,

I’m putting together a new custom routine. Would you mind sharing your thoughts and feedback?

**Some initial FYIs**

• I’m rehabilitating a shoulder injury atm so I’m not going too heavy in my quest for strength skill progressions. Mostly I’d like to keep what I currently have and if I make progress it’s just an added bonus. As such I’m also trying to fix some posture issues which caused my injury by incorporating rows and face pulls.

• I’m focusing a lot on lower body mobility; my hips are incredibly restricted when it comes to tilting for the pancake/forward fold, hence all the pancake work (mostly hinge work). All of this mobility also includes PNF hence no other specific leg work

• My job is pretty exhausting so I need to keep my workouts as time and energy efficient as possible, hence the supersets

**ROUTINE**

Frequency: 3x/week (Mon-Wed-Fri)

**Monday: heavy pull-pancake-core**

A1. Adv. front lever rows 3x6

A2. Straddle good mornings 3x15


B1. Chin-ups 3x7

B2. Seated pancake good mornings 3x15 


C1. Face pulls 3x15

C2. Ab floor slides 3x20


**Wednesday: heavy push-pancake-core**

A1. Tuck planche push ups 3x8

A2. Straddle good mornings 3x15


B1. Wall Handstand pushups 3x6

B2. Seated pancake good mornings 3x15 


C1. Face pulls 3x15

C2. Hanging leg raises 3x12


**Friday: light full body-front and middle splits**

A1. Ring rows (full retraction) 3x12

A2. Split squats 3x12


B1. Dips 3x12

B2. Sumo squats 3x12 (horse stance squats)


C1. Straddle compressions 3x12

C2. Passive stretching for splits


D1. Front splits with PNF

D2. Middle splits with PNF

"This is a question that's already been asked multiple times but with exercises that still feel like you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance.

In my case I'd like to train on off days just for the sake of increasing numbers. Right now I can do about 8 HSPU per 4 sets for **strength**, today I checked and I can only do **36 normal push** ups which is not really that much compared to before I started doing calisthenics. With calisthenics my strength and hypertrophy gains are notorious but it seems I didn't improve in the endurance aspect.

My primary goal is strength and progressing on calisthenics movements (currently pursuing planche and front lever) and endurance comes second.

My endurance goal is to be able to do more normal push ups, inclined pull ups, etc. So, doing something like 2x40 reps of push ups on off days just for the sake of, one day, being able to do 50 reps or more. Will it interfere with my current strength progress? I'm an office worker, I pass 8hr/day in front of the computer and I don't really do any kind of exercise other than my strength routine 3 times a week.","bodybuilding, fitness"

"Hi guys, since September I moved in Milan for studying and I started working out outside in a sport center near my house. But in the last few days temperature started to drop, and I have little to no equipment to have a proper workout session outside. Could you suggest me some gear that could help me? (for example, gloves for doing pull-ups, since the bar is too cold to have a proper grip with bare hands; etc...). How should I layer up? And, above all, how can I warm up properly? Right now I'm sticking to the RR, but every time I complete the warm-up I'm still cold. Thanks for the attention and have a nice day!","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I'm 26, 6'0 and 160lbs average (I say average cause my weight varies a lot) but used to be in the 152lbs range before I started working out consistently 2 months ago. When I started I could barely do 3 bicep curl sets with the 20lbs dumbbells and now I can do 30lbs without feeling like I'm dying. I go to the gym 3 times a week and focus on my arms (I have breadstick arms). So after 2 months I do feel stronger but visibly I don't notice any gains, obviously I look swole after working out but after the months 2 my arms look pretty much thr same. I eat enough protein every day plus a whey protein shake and a generous amount of carbs. Any tips to start seeing muscle? Is 2 months enough to start seeing results? What am I missing?

"I've been trying to figure out for the longest time how to deal with my muscle imbalances from soccer. For reference I kick with my right leg. I've noticed that in terms of balance  (think single leg squats) my left leg is stronger since I used it to plant before kicking, whereas I'm still wobbly on my right leg (knee tends to cave in so I have to focus more).

As for glute definition from the side (think mirror side view ""p"") my right glute is more lifted and bigger than the left (I guess you could say the left side looks like the before and the right looks like the after). This makes sense since I was kicking back so much on my right side so it feels like my left glute is either inactive or the muscle isn't as developed.

Whats a good way to correct this issue. Also if you've struggled with the same issue before, how long did it take before you were able to correct the issue and how often did you perform your exercises?

"I've been working out for a while and I've noticed that bodyweight exercises give me a better workout than weight training. 

However, I would like to know if I mainly do calisthenics, will it be possible to get bigger? Not necessarily very large, but overall bigger as I'm more lean ""hard gainer"" and shorter. I do have dumbbells and a pull up/dip station. 

I usually incorporate both. So I will generally do dumbbell rows right before pull ups etc. Any good routine to incorporate both? I will start to slowly get back into working out next year in January since I was unable to the past 3 months.

"First of all, a big thank you to this inspiring community for all the valuable information you've consistently been putting out there. I've been a lurker here for years!

Has anybody here successfully split the recommended routine?

I'm looking for ideas to reduce the time per workout while still maintaining the total workload. My goal is to work out 6 days a week for about 30 minutes each (excluding warm-up). All information I could find was referencing the old RR.

**So the goal would be to end up with something like this:**

* Mo: A
* Tue: B
* Wed: A
* Thu: B
* Fr: A
* Sat: B
* Sun: Rest

I know it's not ideal to split the recommended routine but a non-ideal workout is better than none and I found it easier to stick to it if I maintain momentum.

**At the moment, my workout looks like this:**

* Bulgarian Split Squad
* Chin Ups
* Bench Dips
* Banded Nordic Curls
* Inverted Row
* Push-Ups
* Ab Wheel
* Pallof Press
* Back extensions

Appreciate your help and looking forward to your suggestions!

**~~EDIT:~~** ~~Thank you guys so much for all the input! It seems like most of you suggest going for an upper/lower split. I think that's a pretty good idea and will give it a try.~~

**EDIT 2:** You guys are so helpful, thanks. Really appreciate the constructive feedback and also the concerns some of you expressed.

**Taking the top comment into consideration, how about this schedule:**

* **A:** pushups + dips + squats + ab wheel
* **B:** chin-ups + rows + nordic curls + back extensions

I would have to let go of the pallof press for the moment but it could be alternated with the ab wheel every few months.

"I am currently training to increase hypertrophy and strength. Both for reasons related to my sport (acrobatics) and for aesthetic reasons I would like to stop once I have reached some goals of % lean mass and body weight.

Here my question arises, what to do once I have reached the desired weight and lean mass to keep improving? Both from the point of view of diet and training.

I'm looking for protocols or authors who talk about it. If I search for the maintenance phase, I found little or nothing of interest. But I wonder, for example, who does weightlifting or martial arts, once they have reached the weight of their category which regimes they follow?

Thanks in advance!

Edit:   
**Of course once reached the goals a person can keep improving stuff like technique, flexibility, mobility, cardio, etc.**    
**Of course If you stop training and eating enough you will lose your progress**

**The questions are, without gaining any more lean mass weight:**

* **Is it possibile to still improve  strength?** 
* **Maybe improve the aesthetics of muscle composition?** 
* **Is it helpful to do a  little hyper-caloric diet? Or it's better to keep a normo-caloric?**","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Few days ago I posted here that I’m interested in starting a body weight routine and looking forward to starting soon. I got some satisfying answers but the there’s one thing I need to figure out how to fix before I start. 

Few months ago I went to the gym and started lifting again after not going for a year and a half. Now note that I’ve always been a couch potato. Constant gaming and film watching. 24 years old , 6’4 ft fall btw. I’ve never been constant at the gym mostly because of college , which I already graduated from. 

When I started lifting, my sleep went to complete shit. I normally sleep 12:30 to 7:30 p.m. sometimes until 8:30. I strongly cherish my sleep, mainly because in my late teens, early 20s I struggled with sleeping. Falling asleep has never even an issue but staying asleep for 7-8 hours was. I would sleep at 12 then wake up a 4 or 5 and couldn’t fall back asleep for another 2-3 hours, leading to being late a work and such. Thankfully now I have better sleeping habits.

But when I started exercising I went back to that shitty sleeping habit.I worked out on a Monday, fell asleep at 12 and woke up at 5:30. Couldn’t fall back asleep. At all. Tuesday I work out again and it was even worse cause I woke up at 4 in the morning that night. Felt like complete shit so I didn’t workout that day. And it that sleeping pattern continued until Sunday. I stopped working out after Tuesday but the sleeping pattern continued. It’s like my body is so used to be fucking lazy that it rejected fucking exercising or something. 

Some have said it’s because I worked out in the evening but that wouldn’t make sense because like I said it continued even on days I didn’t work out. Monday night things went back to normal thankfully and I haven’t exercised since. This happened to me last summer as well. 

What is the issue and how can I fix it? I’m sure it’s like some hormone/adrenaline thing because guess what, when spider man no way home came out, I was fucking excited for the movie and anxious id be spoiled for it that I woke up at 4:30 am and couldn’t fall back asleep at all either. Idk if it’s worth mentioning that.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey everyone,

I have been actively doing BWF and going to the gym for almost two years now with the frequency of about 3-5 a week (generally 5, but some weeks are weaker due to lack of time). I went from 62kg with 1.88m (pretty thin, yeah) to 74kg while reducing my body fat. 

My problem is that I always feel like my body weights too much on its own. I occasionally do cardio, but not that much to avoid losing the little body fat I have. I eat a lot of calories (I count up until 2200 daily and generally go a bit over it). 

I have been considering starting some fighting sport, such as boxing or similar, to try and get used to moving faster. But at the same time, I feel like maybe the problem lies somewhere else and that the sport would just be too exhausting, since I generally just feel really tired all the time.

I generally sleep 7.30-9h a night, I have pretty regular schedules, rarely drink, no drugs, last year I did overall physical and blood exams and everything was A-OK. Maybe it's something I'm missing on my meals? But I think I eat pretty much all types of food (Mediterranean diet). Could also be the depression, since I was diagnosed quite a while ago, but I know a lot of people with depression who can physically move fast without any problems.

Thanks in advance if anyone has some advice or something.

"I plateaued on the weighted pull up for a while. I was running a sets of

Warm up:

1 set of either 4 muscle ups or high pull ups

Main Set:

5 reps of 85 pounds

5 reps of 80 pounds

6 reps of 70.

I tried to get to 90(2 plates) but I was stuck at 4 reps. Unfortunately I got into a car accident and it took me out for a while. When I got back I had to humble myself and start back at 70 pounds for 5 reps. For the longest time I was stuck at 80 pounds for 5, and could occasionally hit the 85 for 5 but not like I had before. I tried experimenting switching grips up, etc but I didn't see much improvement. 

One day I decided to change my routine up a bit.  I noticed I was lacking was volume. I changed my routine to:

5 reps of 80

5 reps of 80

9-12 reps of a plate.

2 weeks later I could hit 95 for 5. Curious to hear if anyone else has stories about breaking plateaus by changing up a workout. One thing I realized was how specific of a change I needed to make to break the plateau. I had tried to change it up by adding one set of 15-20 bodyweight chins after my set as I do not work chins and thought maybe my biceps were my weak point.

I used to complain a lot in high school about how I was working out consistently and wasn’t getting any stronger. Well, I was I guess, but at an extremely slow rate. Recently, I starting taking whey protein powder that has creatine in it (I didn’t even know what creatine was). I noticed that during my gym sessions I was significantly stronger and able to train longer, my muscles looking visibly bigger too. My theory is that my genetic makeup causes my cells to have naturally very low ATP stores and that’s why I feel such a dramatic difference from creatine. I was always training to failure but I think my muscles were failing so fast that there was not enough muscle damage and time under tension to make gains. It finally feels like a linear progression where every gym session I am a little bit stronger than I was last time. My question is what if I stop taking creatine but continue working out? Will I just go back to being just as weak and as I was before? Will my progress go back to being extremely slow? Not trying to gather pity here just genuinely curious.","bodybuilding, fitness"

2.Is it better to train basic exercises like pull ups/dips and focus more in running?
3.Is there any way to train both calisthenics and running and advance in each one?

"Hello everyone, since the start of Covid I like many others I assume, gained a nice chunk of weight whilst like others also lost weight and took a healthier turn to their new lifestyle.

I am unfortunately immunocompromised so I I don't necessarily want to tackle the gym. 

From what was left over from those who bought a bunch of equipment,  I have in my stock (for now) 2 sets of dumbells- 25lb/35lb and a bench that shifts the headboard up/down with the additional part to attach and do sit ups. 

Now this is my ideal want 

Mon- tricep/back

Tues- Chest and maybe tricep again

Wed-legs

Thurs-shoulders 

Fri- bicep + back(unsure of back)

"I know broadly speaking that the Fighter Pull Up program follows the Greasing the Groove concept of achieving a lot of volume with long rests. However the number of reps are different for each program.

Fighter Pull Up: ""you start with an all-out set and then cut a rep in each consecutive"" eg 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

"The exercise in question is easiest to describe by picturing Jesus Christ in his last moments. Just the the look of it, not the feeling for obvious reasons. 


So I was standing in the gym stretched between two cable machines facing each other (cross over pulls set-up) with my arms locked straight. It felt like dead hang with arms pulled to the side. I was able to do both passive (dead) stretch and active stretch as well as very limited range scapular pulls. I experimented for a while with amount of loaded weight to the point I had trouble getting hold of both cables because you need to grab one cable, then walk over to grab the other. That limited my maximum loading so I gave up. 


This morning at home I did a unilateral version on rings. So I laid on the floor on my side and grabbed a ring above, and just hang on it doing sort of a ""'hanging' side-plank"". Now this was very different and much higher load than in the gym. 


I could do both passive hang and active hang and a little scapular motion as well, and then I stopped abruptly in fear that this could be one of those moments of stupidity when one get injured and ends up with a dislocated shoulder. 


So I wanted to see if any of you have experience with this ""stretch"" and if it's any different than a dead hang or if it overlaps too much or not safe enough to be worth considering.

I plan on strength training with my Olympic dumbbell handles, strongman-designed sandbags, and adjustable kettlebell (12kg to 32kg).

My goal is to get strong for overall life situations (ie: helping to move things, survival, etc), as well as participate in everyday life, hobbies (baseball leagues) and learning materials arts.  

My plan is to use the recommendation routine from the bodyweight Fitness subreddit for upper body (2 to 3 times per week), while using my dumbbells, sandbag and/or adjustable kettlebell for legs and posterior chain. The concern is that I don’t know how to incorporate each tool into my program.

A major concern of mine is that when I competed in high school and college years for baseball, I frequently got hamstring injuries when running the bases, so I know that’s a weakness of mine that I wanna avoid. I hear that RDL isn’t enough to mitigate hamstring injuries, but Nordic Curls and GHR are more effective.

"Hi, I've been working out according 5*5 program about 3-4 months and there're really good results, yet at some exercises I failed, because of incorrect execution.
But it isn't main problem. As I know, this program is for 3 days per week and I worked at this regime, but know it's not possible and I have to attend the gym 4 times per week 1,5-2 hours, don't ask me why, just because. 
So I tried to work out at this regime at some point of time, there's a moment when you have to go to the gym 2  days without break, I tried and didn't like it, because i don't think I'm phisically able to do this.
Thus, I've got 3 ideas how to optimise the program:
A) at 4 day i'm doing all exercises as usual, but with really low weights. It gives me opportunity to master the technique of exercises and doesn't demand from my organism a lot of resources.
B) at 4 day i'm doing exercises which aren't connected to a program and train those muscles which doesn't work, while I am working out according the 5*5, yet I don't know which is that exercises, because I feel like every muscle is working when I'm training as usual.
C) change the plan, but really hard, from basical basics but I really don't want to do that.
Thus, this is my situation now. Pleas write your ideas, if you know what exercises I can in B) variant or programs which are like 5*5, write it.

"I just recently achieved my full back lever and I'm trying to improve my hold times (my max is roughly 6-7 seconds now) and I'm trying to get it to over 10 seconds.

The problem I run into nowadays is that I'm unable to perform the back lever in consecutive training sessions even though I don't feel very fatigued (Eg. training on Monday, then training on Wednesday). As far as diet and sleep are concerned, I am eating more than enough and I sleep at least 7-8 hours a day.

On Saturday I was able to do 1x 7s hold and 3x 5s hold. Today, I was barely able to hold it for a couple of seconds. It's 2 days apart so I assume that it would be sufficient rest before training the move again. The amount of volume I do isn't really crazy.

My typical upper body workout looks like this:

\- Skill work: Back lever

3-4x holds

3x5 skin the cat 

Pull-ups: 3-4 sets 12-15 reps

Pseudo Planche push-ups: 3 sets 6 reps (reps constant, lean forward more for progression)

Horizontal rows: 3 sets 15 reps

Dips/straight bar sips: 3 sets 15-20 reps

Hollow body hold: 3 sets 45+ secs

"I'm planning to start training and progressing asymmetric pull ups in January (asym. pull ups --> archer top position hold --> typewriters --> archers). Before that I'm thinking about getting stronger in wide pull ups with holds to make it easier to progress in asymmetric pull ups. 

My idea was to use the fighter pull up programm on the wide pull ups with top hold. I would do this type of workout (5 sets, avoid failure, long rest between sets) 4 times a week. In addition, I would do my basic training once a week (pull and core in 1 day, push and legs in the following day). The basic training is there so I don't neglect other muscle groups.

Does this make any sense or should I rather do something else to strengthen my vertical pulling?

"Hey everyone, I´ve been doing bodyweight training for around 8 months now. I recently got a weighted vest and I´d like to use it to progress on my journey. From what I read online, the idea is to either use it to get out of a slump (not seeing progress for a bit) or when you´ve already hit a desired max rep and want to take it further. For example, if I´m looking to do 6 to 8 reps of an exercise and I manage to do 8 reps for multiple workouts (I was thinking 3 to 5), I would add 4 kg with the vest and continue until I can do 8 reps again, then add more weight and so on. The same thing if I´m trying to do 6-8 reps but have been stuck in 6 reps for multiple workouts (again, I was thinking 3 to 5), though I´m not sure if I should stop after using the vest for a bit and see if I can manage more reps than before. If someone could let me know if this is fine or whether I should go about it differently, I´d appreciate it. Do you have any other tips you´d like to share?

1) i consider adding small 15min full Body HIIT Session after the RR. Does this have a bad Influence on building muscles? By Google i just find to not to it before/to long but no real scientific answers. Does is maybe even help?

2) should i / can i do longer HIIT (30-40 min) workouts on the between days or does this too destroy my aim to build muscles?
i love Team HIIT trainings with a heartbeat sensor with aim to stay above 80% max heart rate and only drop below in the resting times

3) how about spinning classes with the same structure - Intervall Units with getting max heart rate 80-95% max?

To do this, you need a pair of straps. You can use martial art belts. I bought mine for 5 bucks. If you don't have a plate loader, you can just loop the strap through the weight plates.

Benefits of this setup:
* Allows you to go down as deep as you want.
* The weight hangs directly below your upper back and chest.
* Doesn't cause discomfort in your lower back.
* You can go extremely heavy without needing a spotter like with a bench press.

I have done reps with 65 kg of plates hanging off me like this. It's definitely the best way to go heavy on chest at home.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hi. 34 years old male here. Currently at 90kgs. In an effort to control my blood sugar (T1D) and stay healthy, I started the bodyweight exercises. I am doing the BWF Primer right now (Week 2, Day 9). Healtly diet is also on the list.I may be a bit too much focusing on little things, but if it can prevent future injury, why not right? ) My question is which grip is better when doing the table row, parallel to your body or perpendicular?

I don't have any suitable table because the legs are in the middle. I also read here that the row is a 'must do exercise'. I know the are many alternatives to replace the table,.For now I am doing it with dumbell pull and in the meantime I am designing a sort of specialized apparatus to do it properly. As of right now I am in the position to make it better (if any) and I also have the ability to make the grip orientation any direction I want.

I have seen the barbell with parallel grip where you kinda stand in the middle when lifting it. If the regular barbell is good, why is there other type of grip for it?

If you guys can give me some pointer about the grip orientation it will be badass!

Thanks in advance. Of course the equipment I design will double as clothing dump. Haha.","bodybuilding, fitness"
"Hey guys, I just wanted some critique on my routine (made it myself).
For reference, I'm a 17 year old male, 166cm, 63kg. My current goal is strength, with hypertrophy as an added bonus, I guess. My routine is structured like so. Four days of workouts in a week, with Tuesday, Friday and Saturday off. I do a straight arm - bent arm split, with leg work added onto straight arm days. 

Workout 1 - Sun/ Wed:
Warmup + Stretching
15 minutes skill work (Handstand and L-sit to V-sit progression) 

[Back lever progression (5-30s) - 
210s rest] × 3 

[Front lever progressiob (5-30s) - 
150s rest - 
Planche progression (5-30s) - 
150s rest] × 3 

[Anterior chain movement (Pistol/Shrimp squats) (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest - 
Posterior chain movement (Deadlifts/ Reverse Nordic curl) (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest] × 3 

Workout 2 - Mon/ Thu:
Warmup + Stretching
15 minutes skill work (Handstand and L-sit to V-sit progression) 

[One arm pull up progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest - 
Handstand pushup progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest] × 3 

[Muscle up progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest - 
Dip progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest] × 3 

[Front lever pull up progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest - 
Planche pushup progression (4-10 reps) - 
120s rest] × 3 

So, I have a few questions regarding my routine selection 

1: Do you think I should have more training days in a week? Like 5 days, split like 1/2/1/2/1 - rest 2 days - 2/1/2/1/2 - rest 2 days. Or maybe even 6 days a week? 

2: Should I have some focused core work in the routine? I think I'm hitting the core quite well with everything I'm doing, but maybe add in some extra work? 

3: If I am adding in core work, should I reduce the load on the bent arm day by taking out one vertical pull and push movement so it becomes 2 pairs, which then gives room for the core work?","bodybuilding, fitness"
"I hope everyone has a great Christmas (or day/holiday if you don't celebrate Christmas)!

I haven't seen anything posted about it yet, and it may seem like common sense... but a lot of people will be spending time with friends and family today, and there are A LOT of kids on this sub/forum who need to hear this -- There will be lots of food, drinks, desserts, etc., and while days like today may be a diet-conscious person's nightmare; relax and enjoy the day.

Food does not give you happiness, but it's one thing that people come together over, and one day of being relaxed, not stressing, and being normal will not kill you or derail your progress. Days like today aren't ones to miss out on, or to make the people around you feel awkward because you're that person with the prepped food in Tupperware, while everyone else is eating normally. It's not hardcore, it's not that extra 1% that's going to turn you into Ronnie Coleman, it's just not necessary.

Unless you're deep in contest prep, don't be the stereotypical, meathead bodybuilder who doesn't enjoy the food and time with friends/family. Nobody likes that person. We get too little time to spend with the people we care about as-is, so take advantage of today, be present in the moment with the people you love, and make some great memories. Tomorrow you can pick right back up where you left!

P. S. don't try to compensate by eating less tomorrow or doing additional cardio... that's a very slippery slope into an eating disorder. Unless you have a great relationship with food (and even then I still think it's not worth it), just get back to doing exactly what you were before, and pretend the previous day didn't happen.

"Hey everyone, thanks for reading.

I've been working out (at home) since august, doing basic calisthnetics. I feel like I made some decent progress during that time, but recently I've been wondering. Should I be pushing myself to the limit every workout?

Over time I became strong enough to do some exercises I couldn't do before. For example, at the beginning I couldn't do a single push-up. Now I can do about 16 reps x 4. The more 'capable' I became, the more i tried to increase my reps every week. I don't really stick to (example) 4x12 pushups, when I am able to do more. I usually do as many as I can, until I feel like my muscles are about to burst. It doesn't really hurt, it's just a feeling of huge strain.

Is this a good strategy for 'doing more'? Should I keep pushing myself until I can't anymore? or is there a better way? Thanks for any replies in advance :) I'm just trying to make the best progress possible","bodybuilding, fitness"

"TLDR: First meet went great, it’s amazing what a good handler, a good taper, and 800mg of caffeine can do for you on meet day.

[link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNyUVRWAOA5/?igshid=1ldpeyf1xxcvj) to all my 3rd attempts.

I wasn’t originally going to write a meet report but as some of you saw last week, u/abhutchison very generously offered to handle me after finding out she was 5 minutes away from my meet, so I wanted to let you guys know how it went.

Background: I’ve been lifting weights since my freshman year of college and started powerlifting style training about a year ago. I’ve made a decent amount of progress so I wanted to see what I could do on the platform.

Meet Prep: I’ve been running SBS programs for the past six months, but I decided to make my own 4 week peak leading up to this meet. It was pretty simple with me increasing singles and rpe each week and then tapering the last week.

Meet day/day before: I walk around under 82.5 so weigh ins were no problem, I carbed up the day before and got a decent amount of sleep so I was feeling pretty good going into the meet.

Squat: Squat was probably my worst lift of the peak so I had no idea how these were going to go.

Attempt 1: 190kg. Smoked, 3 whites 

Attempt 2: 200kg. This was my third time ever squatting this but it moved just as fast as my opener, 3 whites

Attempt 3: 210kg. After my second attempt I was pretty confident that I had this. It felt heavy on my back but it moved at like RPE 8. 3 whites PR

Bench: The only thing that I was worried about for bench was the rack commands and the pauses. Luckily only one of these things got me into trouble.

Attempt 1: 122.5 Easy. I didn’t even listen for the rack command but I guess I got lucky. 2 whites, 1 red for wrapping my wrist on the platform

Attempt 2: 127.5. This is were things got interesting. It moved like air, but I got 2 reds. One for jumping the rack command, and also for having my butt up. This confused me at first because the head judge gave me the start command while my butt was still up. I had no idea this was a rule but apparently in the USPA the ref looks at the bar, not you, to determine if you get the start command or not.

Attempt 3: I was getting kind of nervous here, I knew I could get 132.5 up but I had to worry about both the rack command and quickly getting my butt down while setting up. Luckily, u/abhutchison talked to one of the USPA ppl and they told her she could give me a hand off so I would have time to get my butt down before starting. This gave me one less thing to worry about and I had to think was “wait, wait, wait” so I wouldn’t jump the rack command. 132.5 moved well, 3 whites PR :).

Deadlift: after going 3/3 on squats and a PR on bench, I was feeling pretty good going into deads. Finally got tired of my attempts looking easy so she convinced me to bump up my 2nd and 3rd deadlift to go for the Jr state record of 255kg.

Attempt 1: 230. Smoked 3 whites

Attempt 2: 245. My original second was 240 so this was a bigger jump than I planned but it moved faster than ever. 3 whites

Attempt 3: 255. After my first 2 attempts I was feeling great. This was probably one of my best deadlifts in terms of technique. Slack pull was perfect and form didn’t really break down. Moved quickly and didn’t get stuck at the floor. 3 whites PR

My biggest goals for this meet was to go 9/9 and total 1300+, with a side goal of 400 wilks. I managed to hit 2/3 and even though I missed my second bench, I’m still happy I was able to “complete” all 9 lifts without having a grinder. u/abhutchison definitely had a big impact on my performance. I’m 99% sure I would’ve missed my 3rd bench if she didn’t go out of her way to figure out the weird rule and also remind me to not jump the rack command. I also would’ve settled for my original 3rd deadlift of 250kg without her giving me the confidence to go for 255. 

Overall this was a great experience and I couldn’t ask for a better introduction into powerlifting. The atmosphere was great and I met a ton of wonderful people.","powerlifting, fitness"
"I've done a post about my training running into this meet in r/weightroom, which is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/p9atfg/programme_review_sbs_20_lprtf_for_meet_prep_meet/).  

TL:DR.  second meet, first since Oct 19.  Set two all time PBs, equaled my best gym PB, increaed my total by 85kg.  

I need to apologise. For some reason the live feed the fed did via facebook appears to have vanished from the ether so I don’t have any video of my lifts. Which is pretty frustrating for me as we all know no vid no did. However, the meet is on openpowerlifting so I guess it did happen?! (mods I'll message you my openpowerlifting profile link as a flair request shortly :) )

My previous meet was my fed’s novice meet in October 2019, where I totalled 340kg at 84kg with 112.5/77.5/160kg for a 228 DOTS. I’ve also done two oly meets, which were in December 2019.

My original handler AKA my younger brother had to drop out about a week before as his work is a bit bonkers right now, so I was scrambling between either going DIY or seeing if there was anyone available in the wider fed who could step up and help. I got lucky and the equipment manager offered to handle me. I am very glad I took her up on this offer. Despite doing hours of set-up the night before and then being busy throughout the meet AND then having to lead the tear down at the end, she found time to look after me and it was a great experience. 

My weight has been solidly in the middle of the u93kg category so that’s the category I signed up for. I was one of 7 u93 and actually the only senior; there was one sub-junior, 4 juniors and 1 M3. 

I ran through a dress rehearsal of warm ups and openers the Sunday before the meet. [These I have videos of here](https://imgur.com/a/QIf84fI). I legit was scared at how fast my squat opener moved. It felt like nothing. I had a small scare when looking at the bench videos because it kinda looks like my heel is slightly raised. My fed is IPF affiliated so it’s flat feet all the way. I played about with foot placement a bit when doing my deload bench session during the week and improved it some, but I was still worried. Deadlifts are the greatest lift and I had no worries there. 

Meet Day

I weighed in at a decent 88.2kg, which was actually 1.5kg below what my home scales had registered me at 2 hours previous. I blame the nervous poos. 

I was in flight A and went out first or second on pretty much every attempt. The M3 lifter and I had almost identical attempts so we switched positions several times. 

Squats

Opener 125kg 3 whites. Absolutely smoked this. Moved faster than my last warm-up. I actually came off the platform feeling like I’d been pranked and they’d loaded 60kg. 

Second attempt 135kg 2 whites. Easy. My brother was watching at work on the live stream and told me it shifted fast. Wasn’t sure why I’d got a red from the side judge and neither was my handler. 

Third attempt 145kg 3 whites. +5kg all time PB, +32.5kg meet PB. So apparently my red in the previous attempt was because I hadn’t fully locked my knees out after walking the bar out. The head judge was kind enough to let me know this while I was waiting for the command. Was able to rebrace, lock it out and hit the lift. Might have let out a big scream when I saw all three whites. Hindsight reckons I could have made 150, but this was already 5kg over what I was aiming for anyway. 

Bench

Opener 95kg 3 whites. Phew. No issues with my foot placement and heels at all. It did not move anywhere near as fast I would have liked but 1) this is due to me maybe not training with a decent enough pause on the chest and b) it being an ambitious opener. 

Second Attempt 100kg 3 whites equal AT PB, +22.5kg Meet PB. Sllooow. But I was pumped to make this. Like really, really pumped. This is literally the second time ever I’ve benched 100kg. 

Third Attempt 105kg 3 reds. Decided to send it and go for a bigger jump than I’d intended. Was honestly feeling good. Got about 6 inches off the chest before I had downward movement. For another day. Still pumped from the 100kg though

Deadlift best lift

Opener 160kg 3 whites. Flew up. I find deadlift the weirdest lift to do on the platform. All you’ve got is the head judge sitting there with his hand up just waiting for you to do something. It was the same judge I had in Oct 2019 so slight feelings of Deja-vu!

Second attempt 170kg 3 whites. Moved better than expected to be honest. Handler put in my next attempt and we had a joke that she should have just added another 5kg while my back was turned. 

Third attempt 180kg 3 whites. +10kg AT PB, +20kg meet PB Man, I wish we’d added another 5kg. This moved like warm butter. Best lift of the day for me and I am so gutted that I can’t find the livestream because I wanna see if it moved as fast as it felt. 

Total 425kg +85kg meet PB. 

Conclusions

* · Very, very happy to be able to compete again after a long time. I don’t compete to win as I doubt I’ll be competitive ever. Lifting is very much a hobby and stress relief for me, so I compete to be better than I was last time. I was definitely very much better than last time. 
* · My local fed are good at organising meets. It was a long day but there were 4 flights and 45 lifters. My flight and flight B (23 lifters in total) got done in 2.5 hours. The spotters in particular from Implexus Gym in Leeds were tireless and contributed to the smoothness of the meet. 
* · Could I have handled myself? Yes undoubtably. All the other lifters in my flight helped out with warming up and provided incredible support, especially one of the u105s in my flight. Would I have had as much fun? Definitely not. My handler was great, I got the right amount  of motivation and hype from her as I wanted and it was all around a great experience. 
* · Best lifts of the day for me were one of the women u76 setting 4 M1 local fed records. She’s also the chairwoman for the fed so it was cool to see the executive practicing what they preach and doing it well. The woman who won best lifter and the u76 also had the best third attempt deadlift I’ve ever seen. It literally went on for several minutes and she didn’t hitch or get any red lights. Incredible grind and wonderful commitment to the bit. The entire venue lost their minds at this point. 
* · Pleased to have hit in competition the metric 3/2/4 pl8s. I doubt next time I’ll get such big increases, although you never know. 
* I wasn't dead fucking last! I beat the M3 lifter on DOTS!  

I'm planning now to do the SBS2.0 hypertrophies template for a bit to get some decent volume in.  My fed will probably be running a Spring meet in March or April so I may compete in that.  

Having said that; I am really tempted to try competing with the APBU in raw+wraps; I messed about with wraps a little bit in the run up to this meet; it's a long story but initially I didn't have a place at this meet when I started my prep so I had planned to do a mock meet at my gym in wraps, for shits and giggles.  

I wish I'd got videos.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Obviously not nearly as impressive as most meet reports here, but I wanted to share as this was my first ever meet. Roughly 8 months before this meet was the first time I had ever touched a barbell, and prior to that had no real strength training experience besides some rock climbing. I obviously have a long way to go, but happy with my first meet performance!

9/9 Successful Attempts
Squat: 125 kg, 135 kg, 140 kg
Benchpress: 85 kg, 90 kg, 95 kg
Deadlift: 160 kg, 172.5 kg, 180 kg
Total: 415 kg

I didn't really take note of which lifts got red lighted. The only ones I saw were one red light for each side judge on my 2nd and 3rd deadlift attempts.

I didn't go into this meet with many programming adjustments leading up to it or anything. My plan was to simply learn how to compete and I wanted to put up a 400 kg total. I simply cut volume and accessories a week out and focused more on training heavy singles. I did not cut weight at all, as I have been sitting around 72-73 kg comfortably and didn't think that was good idea to do for a first meet either.
Every attempt, with the exception of my 3rd deadlift attempt, was a weight I had done in the gym before. My 3rd squat and benchpress were just under my gym PRs. I didn't want to risk a lot as I had no idea how I would feel or perform on the platform. Happy I picked my attempts safely as that made me go 9/9, but I didn't expect such a surge of adrenaline on every lift. My 3rd deadlift was a ~5 kg PR and every lift felt easy compared to most of the heavy singles I'd done the previous week.
I went into this meet expecting to be super nervous on the platform and unsure what I was supposed to do. Upon arriving, the meet director and team were incredibly helpful and all the lifters were friendly and supportive. The environment was more relaxed than I expected and I had a fantastic experience. Definitely a community I want to be a part of and I look forward to my next meet!","powerlifting, fitness"
"On the heels of our previous video on proper form for heels up benching, former IPL World Record holder, Dave Spitdowski, Jr., shot this video for the Garage Gym Life Media YouTube channel on How to Bench Flat footed. As Ryan Di Pompeo covered in the last video, benching with heels down presents some technical challenges with leg drive and your butt coming up, both of which Dave addresses in this video.  Dave also covers his preferred set up and things he teaches his clients to consider as they get into position to bench press in competition or in training. 

[How to Bench Flatfooted](https://youtu.be/nGy3vjelFpI)","powerlifting, fitness"
"**TL;DR** - First meet moving up from 72kg to 76kg, went 7/9 with a squat and bench PR. My goals going into this meet were: S 157.5kg, B 85kg, D 182.5kg. Fell 12.5kg short of a 76kg qualifying total for Nats with 410kg.


**Background:**  I started powerlifting competitively in January of 2018 after watching my best friend compete for the first time the previous October. I had been lifting consistently for a little over two years at this point with a sole focus on cross training for roller derby. I juggled roller derby and powerlifting together for all of 2018 with consistent knee pain from skating and various bumps and bruises/fatigue/minor injuries. Signed on with a legitimate coach in my area in January 2019, dropped derby for the year to focus on PL and going to 2019 Raw Nats. This is my 9th competition and my first as a 76kg lifter. I had planned on returning to derby in 2020 and welp, Roni had other plans but I'm okay with it. 

**Squats:** I hit my first ever 300 squat in competition in January 2019. I have struggled for a long time with a mental roadblock any time there's 300lbs or more on my back and have been working on mental toughness with squats. Hitting not 1 but 2 squat PRs in one competition was huge for me. I unfortunately did not get my third squat here because I jumped the rack command but it was SO LOUD and I was so stoked that I made the lift that I just racked it. I've never missed a lift for jumping commands but there's a first time for everything right? :']

[2nd attempt](https://streamable.com/sorved) **152.5kg/2.5kg PR** Judges originally gave me two reds for ""not having my knees locked"" at the beginning of this squat, but the head judge reversed the call because she had given me the start command anyway so thankfully I got this lift.

[3rd attempt](https://streamable.com/4htnrh) **157.5kg** Not getting this lift in competition for missing a command kind of crushed my soul but if there's one way to make sure I'll never miss a command again, this is it *I guess*. Coach says we'll still increase training numbers bc as far as we're concerned, this was a legitimate squat that was obviously not missed due to strength.

**Bench:** Literally no complaints here, training or otherwise. Bench has been progressing steadily for a while and I'm super close to a milestone number.

[3rd attempt](https://streamable.com/a5n6cf) **85kg 7.5kg PR** Was pleasantly surprised to learn what weight was on the bar after this lift bc I literally am the worst at kilos to pounds. A lot of the time I do better **not** knowing what weight is on the bar when it comes to PR attempts because again, mental toughness yadda yadda yadda. But yay big bench PR!

**Deadlift:** Deadlifts are my fav and although I have some form breakdown to work on when it comes to heavy weight, they're still bae. I once failed my opener and second attempt in competition because I used to pull sumo before I had a coach, and I was so upset and angry because I just didn't understand what was happening (later found out it was due to an awful rug on the platform, for real). I switched stances for my third attempt and ripped it up off the floor conventional and haven't pulled sumo since. 

[2nd attempt](https://streamable.com/6om73f) **172.5kg/matched best** This was a great deadlift, no complaints on the second attempt. Decided to go for the big pull at 187.5kg for my third to try and hit my meet goals but it just straight up wasn't there. I started pulling and it broke the floor by 4-5 inches (did NOT feel like that...felt more like 1 inch hah) and pretty much table topped it. Hips shot up and it just felt like garbage, so I stopped. In hindsight a 10kg jump from 1st to 2nd attempt instead of 10kg from 2nd to 3rd was probably a better idea so I could have kept with the theme of 2nd attempt PRs but, alas. We'll get 'em next time!

**Excited to see what the next meet brings! Goals are a qualifying total for Nats 2022 and to beat the only person I should be trying to beat -- myself.**","powerlifting, fitness"
"I have noticed a significant difference in the way that old-school benchers such as Scot Mendelson and  Dave Hoff bench and newer people like Julius Maddox and Kirill bench. If you look at this video where Scot teaches the bench, he is essentially only using upper back and inner tricep strength to do the lift.

[How to Bench 700lbs | Scot Mendelson Teaches The Bench Press & Body Drive - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCBAJoQvms8)

Now, compare this to how Julius Maddox does it and while he does incorporate back strength to leverage the lift, it still remains very chest-dominant.

[Julius Maddox, 744 All-Time World Record Bench Press - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSTEYTwnB1g)

Same thing with Kirill:

[Kirill Sarychev 335 kg(738.5lbs) RAW Bench Press World Record 2015 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOeRI6MDyns)

I'm wondering: what differences have you noticed between the two lifts? And can any one of these be more effective for certain groups of people? I like Scot Mendelson's style since he pretty much makes a human version of a multi-ply shirt in his technique and relies on full-body strength rather than just muscling it through with your chest. But, I'd love to hear your thoughts!","powerlifting, fitness"
"Hey everyone, this is my first post on r/powerlifting, and I decided to share my thoughts and progress on [Candito's 6 Weeks Program](http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-programs/) and how I autoregulated this to see progress in my SBD. Before I go on, here's some background, so you know what kind of lifter I am.

I'm a 171cm/5'7"", 73KG/160lbs, 23M Singaporean aspiring competitive powerlifter (so I haven't competed yet, but planning soon when the federations here are allowed to hold a meet!) and previously, I lifted for about two years doing a mix of fuck-all and bodybuilding. Before making a switch to training solely for powerlifting, I consistently used [nSuns's 5/3/1](https://liftvault.com/programs/powerlifting/n-suns-lifting-spreadsheets/) and saw very little progress as my body couldn't recover very well from all the volume work. As a full-time designer, while also doing full-time studies, I needed a program designed with periodisation such that I can recover in a way my body is more suited to.

Throughout my previous gym experience, I suffered from a left rotator cuff injury from overhead pressing. Really unnecessary injury, but I had to live with it as a lesson for myself.

I ran Candito's 6 Week Program for three full cycles, but some autoregulation and adjustments extended the program by a week or more. You can't really consider them exactly ""6 weeks"". I started my program in mid-November 2020 and consistently ran the program till March 2021 (so it's about 20 weeks).

Some caveats:

* My PRs are gym PRs;
* I tested all my lifts on separate days, not using an SBD day;
* I always tested my PR, even though the program doesn't necessarily require you to
* I bench pressed and low-bar squatted with wrist wraps
* I didn't use a belt for all my PRs (I'm too broke for it, LOL)
* \#SumoIsLife
* I hook grip, so rip thumbs
* My leverages aren't the best, but not the worst. I have average length arms, average length femurs.

&#x200B;

||*Week 0 (Mid-Nov, 2020)*|*1st Cycle (Dec, 2020)*|*2nd Cycle (Mid-Jan, 2020)*|*3rd Cycle (Mar, 2020)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Squat*|100kg (220lbs)|110kg (243lbs)|130kg (286lbs)|140kg (308lbs)|
|*Bench*|95kg (209lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (220lbs) touch-and-go|100kg (231lbs) comp-style|110kg (243lbs) comp-style|
|*Deadlift*|140kg (308lbs)|150kg (330lbs)|180kg (396lbs)|200kg (441lbs)|
|Total|335kg (738lbs)|360kg (794lbs)|410kg (904lbs)|450kg (992lbs)|

In short, after 20 weeks, my total went from 335kg/738lbs to 450kg/992lbs.

Almost a thousand-pound total and in between, I even managed to fix my deadlift and low-bar squat form, which probably contributed to the jump you see from 1st cycle to 2nd cycle.

Generally, this is what I applied to make Candito's awfully good for my progress.

# Understanding my Body's Reaction

I started my 1st cycle without adjusting anything. Suppose Candito told me to do 3x8 for a barbell row, sure. If there wasn't an accessory exercise for the day, I didn't any. Overall, I found some personal issues with the program that I can tweak:

1. Bench volume was too low
2. Squat volume was too high
3. Deadlifting after squatting didn't feel too bad, but I felt better doing the reverse

**Note: the program tells you to use your Week 5 lift results to calculate your max. I disregard it and treat it as a max peaking phase and add back-off sets to accessorise. I test my lifts on Week 6.**

Here's what I did to adjust to the program specifically for each of the three lifts:

# Bench Press

This program gets a common complaint about having too little volume for bench press, and that's right. If you follow the program to a tee, you'll find that you're doing more back and shoulder work right after bench press, without having insofar a single compound accessory that's a push and *not* shoulder work.

Hence, I always added more sets and tweaked the weights and intensity according to the week's goal (e.g. if I'm starting to peak, I'll dial back the reps and up the weight).

Here's a general recommendation:

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Larsen Press (70%, 3x5)|Closed-Grip (60%, 3x8)|
|2|Larsen Press (80%, 4x4)|Closed-Grip (70%, 3x5)|
|3|Paused Bench (85%, 3x3)|Larsen Press (80%, 3x2)|
|4|Paused Bench (90%, 3x2)||
|5|Paused Bench (95 - 97.5%, 3x1)||

Why?

* Larsen + Closed-Grip is a killer back-off exercise after bench, but really good for volume work.
* Paused Bench can vary from 1s to 3s paused, but the idea is to get really good with the technique and mimic competition style with a weight that I can reliably perform anytime.

I also threw in much back work and shoulder work rather than working on chest stuff with the dumbbell. This was a philosophy transferred from nSuns; if **I am to bench** ***n*** **kg, I should also be rowing** ***n*** **kg** for at least one rep with good form.

# Squat

Squat was an unfortunate lift. I had a ""stripper squat"":

* Knees tracked too far
* Torso fell forward a lot
* Hip shift to the right
* Using my quads to drive rather than from the bottom-up

Overall, shit form. My squats were so goddamn ugly. I fixed that in Week 1 and got my groove by learning to lift without the mirror. Since I constantly used the mirror to watch my squat, I kept using it to judge depth, judge barbell position and became overly reliant on visuals rather than my body.

My squat is still somewhat ugly, but I was squatting with much less injury potential. Side note, I still hate squats!

Here is my general recommendation on what I did for my accessory:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Squats (60%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (60%, 3x3)|
|2|Squats (70%, 3x8)|Paused Squats (70%, 3x3)|
|3|Paused Squats (80%, 3x2)||
|4|Paused Squats (90%, 2x2)||
|5|Paused Squats (95%, 2x1)||

I didn't include front squats because my quads were *wayyyyy* more developed than my hammies and glutes. I also included other accessories after squats:

* The best way to improve squat is to do more squats (with good form throughout, of course)
* Paused squats help me build more confidence in performing sub max lifts reliably.

Because I did deadlifts before squats, my posterior chain is totally fried, and I usually end the day by the end.

# Deadlift

Yes, I do sumo deadlift, and I absolutely love it. You can see why there's a 60kg gap between my deadlift and squat (more on that later). I tweaked my form throughout the cycle after realising that it was a [knee hinge](https://www.elitefts.com/education/the-sumo-deadlift-youre-doing-it-the-wrong-way/). More tweaking later, and I worked out a form that's more suited to my body.

Here are the accessories that I did from Cycle 1 to 3:

&#x200B;

|Week|Accessory 1|Accessory 2|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Conventional Deadlift (65-70%, 3x5)||
|2|Conventional Deadlift (75-80%, 4x3)|Paused Sumo (70%, 2x4)|
|3|Paused Sumo (80%, 3x3)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|4|Paused Sumo (85-90%, 3x2)|Deficit Paused (70%, 3x3)|
|5|Paused Sumo (90%, 2x2)|Deficit Paused (75%, 3x3)|

Why?

* Conventional helps with the hip hinge at lockout (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong), but since I don't lift conventional I treat it as volume work;
* Paused sumo really helps a lot, much like how I programmed paused squats and paused bench. It's really to build confidence with the weight, but paused sumo also drove me to get good with my form.
* Deficit paused is a real killer, but it helps with squeezing out every bit of my legs.

# Reflections from 3 cycles:

Gonna keep this short so in sum:

* For every set of bench, I tried to do 2 sets of back work. If there were 9 sets of bench, I did 18 sets of back work (varying exercises)
* Row your bench weight
* Am I a deadlift specialist? Probably not, I suck at squats, and I'm unconfident about it. Going under the bar and feeling the whip makes me feel dread. Mental strength is critical.
* Take care of your rotator cuffs
* Rear delts are your best friend
* Warm-up like hell and activate every muscle you need for the lift that day.
   * Bench: hip flexors, glutes, upper back, lower back, delts, and triceps.
   * Squat: hip flexors, glutes, back, chest stretches (for low-bar), more lat specific stretches, quads, hamstrings
   * Deadlift: ~~every damn thing~~ hip flexors, glutes, lats, upper back, quads and hamstrings

# What I'm going to do from now on:

I will run the program three more times again as I've already seen progress during my training. Previous RPE8s now feel like RPE7s, and my hook grip is getting better. This time, I'll do things a bit differently after I end this cycle:

1. More shoulder work. My overhead press is still a paltry 55kg/121lbs for a 1RM, and I believe there is a substantial carryover.
2. I will up the bench volume so that I can work on my leg drive. Most of my PRs for the bench are still quite reliant on my chest and shoulder strength, not so much for my leg drive
3. Squat more!

Thanks for reading this long-ass review! I'll be back 20 weeks later to share my progress.

*Just to share my targets by the end of three cycles so I can look back at this post and see if I've done it:*

* Squat: 170kg/396lbs
* Bench: 120kg/264lbs
* Deadlift: 240kg/507lbs
* Total: 530kg/1168lbs

"tl;dr video version [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUATr3TF3eJ/?utm_medium=copy_link).  7/9 day that should have been 8/9 if I was smarter adjusting to bench start/press lengths on the day.  Ended up with all lifts meet PRs for a total PR of 86.5kg


First meet since 2019 after multiple cycles of gym closures and having to swap from DIY strongman on a budget, to rented equipment in a tiny basement, and back aagin.  Somehow through it all managed to still come out of it all much stronger than I went in (no small part due to the blood sweat and tears of /u/bigcoachd).  

**Squat**
This was the one lift I was going in with the most confidence in, and it showed.

* 290 Opener - 2 whites, call on depth
* 312.5 - Took this a bit deeper after the opener, almost died but made it.  3 whites
* 317.5 -  2 whites, but much smoother than my second.   I likely had 320 in me still, but wanted to play it safe.


**Bench**
This is one that I guess I was overconfident in and did not properly adjust to the day.

*  200 Opener - 2 whites, flagged with a blue.
*  215 x2 - The much longer than I've trained with hold before the start command was given threw me off a lot.  Hindsight I should have taken smaller jumps on the day.


**Deadlift**
This was the lift I actually had the least confidence in going in, since peaking for it didn't go as planned.  

* 310 Opener - 3 whites, felt significantly slower than it was, so that combined with bench perfomance made me take smaller risk jumps here
* 320 - 3 whites again, starting to feel really fatigued
* 330 - 3 whites, barely managed this.  Bar felt like it came to a standstill at least 3 times.


All in all it was successful day.  Every lift was a meet PR, and squats a slight lifetime PR.  As much as I'm frustrated with the bench I really shouldn't complain with a 86.5kg total PR, but am left with wanting more.  

Biggest take away is hire Dave Osborn as a coach.  He makes you try trying more gooder.","powerlifting, fitness"
"\[Hi all. I posted this in one of the daily threads and didn't get any responses, so I'm trying the main board. The rules were a bit dubious on where this post would belong. I apologize if this still belongs in the daily thread. I'm happy to take down the post to oblige the rules of the community.\]  


 

**Bottom line: Looking for some perspective on selecting my openers for my first PL meet.**

**Context:** Saw that there was a USPA meet in my hometown in mid-Dec. Got a wild hair on my ass and decide to register. It will be my first-ever meet. I'm about four weeks out from the meet. Not the ideal timeline to just find out about a meet, but whatever. I don't expect to be competitive. I have a bad combination of being too weak, fat, and young to actually be competitive. This is mostly just for the experience and challenge.

**Me:** 37 yo, male, \~240 lbs, 5'8"", diagnosed with low T (150 ng/dl, on low dose T now for about 3 months but haven't gotten updated blood, no AI)

**Training background:** Been doing SS off/on since Jan 2020. Started with all empty bars and progressed from there. Didn't really have a lifting background prior to this other than fooling around in the gym while deployed during my military time. I've progressed to the point where I'm now doing a modified SS Texas Method. Biggest deviation is that I do lift sumo instead of conventional due to recurring low-back issues (from poor conventional form most likely). If you're familiar with the TM, you'll notice my ""intensity"" weights and my ""volume"" weights.

**Current lifts:** (note, I've never approached a session in the gym with the goal of ""discovering"" my 1RM, 3RM, 5RM, so I don't know what my peak numbers could be. The below numbers are just where I am currently at in my progression. I have about one more week where I will likely be boosting each of these lifts about 5-10 lbs for multiple reps before I switch focus to mock meet prep and lifting with commands. All weights below are in lbs.

**Squats**

Intensity: 355x1x5, then 360x1x1 for fun

Volume: 310x5x5

**Bench**

Intensity: 265x(2,1,1,1)

Volume: 227.5x5x5

**Deadlift**

Intensity: 350x1x5 and 360x1x1 for fun

Volume: 306x3x5

**Meet Lifts:** Considering this is my first meet, I anticipate a lot of stage fright/performance anxiety. As such, I've decided to go with pretty conservative openers because, at this point, every successful lift is a Meet PR. I've never lifted with commands, but that will be my focus from Thanksgiving to the Dec 18 meet. I believe my form is pretty rock-solid as far as getting three whites goes. It strictly follows the SS form, so not an optimal PL competition form, but it will get me whites if I stick to what I'm familiar with.

*Squat opener:* 160 kg / 353 lbs

*Bench opener:* 110 kg / 243 lbs (I'm most nervous about my bench due to the pause at the bottom while waiting for the cue. I don't bounce, but I don't pause either.)

*Deadlift opener:* 160 kg / 353 lbs

Am I totally off base on anything? Do the openers seem like reasonable targets based on where I'm at? For my second and third attempts, I have three numbers preselected based on how the previous lift felt, ie a safe option, a strong option, and a stretch option. Pie in the sky, I'd love to have at least 6/9 successful lifts and break 1,000 lbs.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Background: Last meet I did was in March 1st and was my first meet with my coach. Fast forward almost year and half later and I have made substantial progress with my coach.

Meet Prep: 12 week prep that was off and on pound plates and kilos. Was hitting prs almost every session and weights all moved fairly well despite being busy with real life things.

Meet Day: Woke up at about 10 and ate 2 eggs and drank some water as I was fine on weight. Weigh ins were around 12 and managed to be 2nd in line. Recomped with wawa hoagie and pedialyte.

"This is my 3rd time competing in Virginia, and let me tell you guys, this level of meet production is worth every single penny you spend to travel and prep for the meets held here.

Background and Training:

I've been competing for over 3 years now. This meet was the first (and only) time I ever have coached myself for an entire prep. I did not run anyone’s programming except for my own, and treated myself how I treat my own clients. I took a rather aggressive approach with my peak, with a taper 4 days out, rather than 1 week. My final heavy singles (which I estimated were second attempts at the time) were 1 week out instead of doing openers/sub maximal work as traditional programs would go.

This prep was about 8 weeks total. I originally signed up to compete as a 52kg and retry this weight class after missing weight the last time, but without a coach to check me and make sure I’m cutting weight properly, I didn’t feel comfortable. I ended up emailing the director to bump up to 57kg, which is my usual weight class.

Meet Day:

I weighed in at 56.3kg, which was a bit heavier than I anticipated being. I was expecting 55.9 since I had been consistently weighing in at 55.6-.7ish, but my belief is that I had too much sodium the night before with some Spanish rice I ate haha. I was one of the first to weigh in so I was in and out and ready to roll.

Squats-

Opened with 130kg/286lb. This was a number I was very comfortable hitting, as it had became a final warmup for my heaviest sessions throughout prep. Good lift.

Second attempt was 137.5kg/303lb. I hadn’t hit anything above 297 in comp prior to this, so this was a platform PR for myself. Good lift.

Third attempt was 142.5kg/314lb. My right quad cramped up really bad going into the hole and I ultimately lost it and couldn’t get it. No lift.

Bench-

Opened with 75kg/165lb. This was the heaviest I have ever opened for bench. I felt confident about this one but had a bit of a shaky bar path going down. I was able to come back and make it a solid opener. Good lift.

Second attempt was 80kg/176lb. Again, I felt confident. It moved even faster than the opener. But I got called on my butt coming up, so it was no lift.

Third attempt was 82.5kg/181lb. I shouldn’t have let my ego do the talking because I had to grind for my life just to get this up. Butt came up more obviously on this lift, so again, no lift.

Deadlifts-

Opened conservatively at 130kg/286lb. It flew and I knew I needed to finish these strong after how bench went. Good lift.

Second attempt was 137.5kg/303lb. This one moved just like an opener, and it felt pretty good. Good lift.

Third attempt was 142.5kg/314lb. I have ALWAYS struggled with this number on the platform and I FINALLY nailed it, with more in the tank. I was extremely happy with how this moved considering I only hit it once in training. Good lift.

Ultimately a 6/9 day. Not bad, not great. Just meh. Ended 2nd in the open (tied for first but lost on BW) and 1st in JR’s. Added 10kg to my total which is pretty cool.

Final Thoughts:

I am pretty proud of myself considering I coached myself into this meet. I didn’t know how it was going to go down or if I could even really do it. However, I really don’t recommend taking this route of self coaching for meets. Had I had a coach watching over me, I think I could’ve been a bit smarter with my bench attempts and not let my ego come out to play. Even if you’re running someone else’s program (think like Candito etc) I still would recommend getting a coach. Having that second set of eyes can be very crucial, especially when you’re trying to build a total up.

This was a fantastic meet and I am forever grateful for the community of powerlifting, and I really look forward to competing again in 2022. I decided to take a bit of time off to work on my deadlift and fix a few other things that I want to fix before hopping right back into another prep. A longer off season is long overdue for me. Thank you for reading this long post!

"**Background and training:**

This was my fifth meet after taking almost exactly two years away from the platform. I had two bad meets in a row and I am very happy that I took some time to allow my strength to catch up to my performance goals. As with the last four years or so, u/bigcoachD handled my coaching. We've really grown together from a 180 lb college kid with a slight knack for deadlifting to a 230 lb man with an actual knack for deadlifting.

My training has definitely evolved to have more input from myself in terms of the level of intensity that I am willing to push each day, especially in prep. Prior to the last year, I was a guy who would say everything was an RPE 7.5 even when my face was bleeding. With practice and trust, Dave let me control my destiny so to say, and it gave me great incentive and drive while also forced me to be accountable for my own choices and reckoning with weekly RPE 11 singles until I cut that shit out. We ended with a [625 lb squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/CT0LglhBEdZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), a [365 double](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQuQZMsgRFF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) on bench, and a fast as fuck [755 lb pull.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUBTGKCgiE3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) We set tentative goals of 661/374/771 on a top performance day.

**Weigh Ins:**

I whittled my weight down to 219.8 the morning of the meet. No water cut or anything, just shedding a few fatty lbs and taking a poop to get under 220 for this meet before the bulk to 242. My scale at home was 5.5 lbs heavy. Fuck. At least it's a Dots bonus instead of a new weight class! Food, carbs, food, water, food, sugar, and food got me up to 223 on the same scale for the day of the meet: that's what I call a refeed.

**Squats:** [videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUluv_lgH3O/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), 132 lb meet PR

588: three whites

* Moved like butter as an opener should. I came in with a goal of having my first 3/3 meet on squats and this was a great start. Heaviest opener of the meet and this alone was the heaviest squat of the day.

633: two whites, one red 

* Moved like a good jump second should. Making eye contact with strangers will never be normal to me. It skeeves me out to have some weird dude eying you down in a singlet and going ass to the floor doing it lmao. This was a perfect second due to feeling heavy but moving very well and giving me some confidence. The red was for a depth--first time that's ever been called on me before. But you only need two whites!

650: three reds

* Damn. The platform buckled under my left foot out of the whole and I had some pretty noticeable hip shift, so finishing this out was up in the air. Might have had it, might not have, but the spotters and judges did the right thing and did a fabulous job keeping everyone safe. 300kg awaits next time.

**Bench:** [3rd attempt here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUj7_oorYxz/), 71 lb meet PR

330: two whites, middle red

* Started with a soft elbow but got whites from the side judge. Fixed that up later and had a total still!

352: three whites

* My back cramped HARD. Have you ever grabbed on to an electric fence? That's what my entire torso felt like. I don't get to train on a competition bench, so the height and width allowed me to get a lot tighter (yay) so much so that my back squeezed itself into oblivion (boo). Still hit it tho.

363: two whites, middle red

* I took my normal grip here but didn't arch as hard and kept my heels up rather than down into the platform to keep from cramping alongside making this attempt really conservative. Same soft elbow call on the other arm. Same judge that gave me the depth call on a pretty deep squat. Hmm.

**Deadlift:** [videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUoNM39g_4r/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), 83 lb meet PR

705: three whites

* Having a dramatically higher opener than anyone else feels simultaneously baller as fuck and really awkward. The meet director, upon hearing my deadlift opener, didn't even look up and said ""in kilos honey."" Hearing the music dull and everyone fall eery quiet is so fun when you blow it up. Best part of the meet for sure! Felt that platform wonk again so I moved the next two back to get some stability. This would have been the heaviest pull of the meet on its own.

733: three whites

* Took a good jump to have a real solid PR and feel some weight in my hands. I need kilo plate practice. Again having the whole gym cheer for you on the white lights is an awesome feeling. You see that shit in ATWR videos and it feels fun to get some of that yourself. Just a little bit of external validation for your hard work can go such a crazy long way.

749: three reds, nap

* Having the whole gym in your ear for your third dead (as the last pull of the meet) is a really special experience. That alone made this cool. No music, no frills, just a bunch of strong people telling you to pick that shit up.
* Took a little napper after clearing the knees on this one. Just didn't have it in me--went from holding it at my knees to waking up with a judge grinding her thumb into my sternum and some big ass hands on my titties. Ordinarily you have to pay for that.
*  Deadlifting is so hard after squatting and benching max weights and it only becomes more pronounced as you get stronger, imo. My slack pull was a hair aggressive, but everything else was good. Just gotta get stronger. I've only ever blacked out on failed pulls before, I think from the pressure build holding the weight instead of pulling through the sticking point.

**Total:**

1729 lb total, 488 Dots. 324 lb total PR!

**Conclusion:** ***Best Lifter, 1st place 100 kg, heaviest squat of meet, heaviest deadlift of meet, biggest total of meet (raw/wraps/single ply), biggest overall Dots (male/female raw/wraps/single ply). Not a bad day.***

Everything I learned and gained from this one is that I need to keep getting bigger and keep getting stronger. I want to mix in some days of squatting and pulling together. I want to gain another 20 lbs. I want to keep hammering accessories. I want to practice execution on calibrated plates. I want to show up on meet day and prove how strong I am. My mood on this is content: not happy, not sad. I set huge meet PRs, I know what I'm capable of after this, and I have a plan to make it happen. 1800 lbs and a 500 Dots were stretch goals for this meet--a year from now I want to blow those out of the water. It's pretty neat that I can show up to a meet of a lot of people who train in the gym the meet is held in and walk away with best lifter on a very meh performance day. I also now have deadlifted more than my coach by 37 lbs. Yeah yeah, he's out-benched me by 149 lbs, but who is the real winner here?

Till next time... ^(bulk to 242)","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background**

This was my second meet, and first without a coach or a handler.  I totaled 1275 in my first meet in 2019.  I am fortunate enough to have a gym in my garage, so I have been able to train without interruption through the pandemic.  Like many of us, I skipped meets in 2020, so I was excited to get back on the platform in 2021.  

I prepped using the RTS 12-week peaking template, which was also my first foray into RPE-based training.  The program uses the now-familiar ""single @ 8"" formalism to baseline the session and cascade into the volume work.  I squatted twice a week, benched 4 times per week, and deadlifted twice per week on a four day split. Competition movements were done once per week, with all other exposures being variations. Most sessions took me 2 hours to complete, though my work capacity is crap, so younger, fitter individuals could probably finish faster.  Overall I would recommend the program to any intermediate lifter.  

**Squat**

I gave up caffeine for two weeks before the meet and was feeling like I was floating after reintroducing it this morning.  Do recommend, if you can handle the headaches in the first few days after coming off.  

It's always a bit disorienting to come from my garage power rack to a monolift with a squat bar.  I competed in the ""Raw Modern"" division but wore sleeves instead of wraps, and walked out my squats.  For my opener it was no problem, but I almost blew the walkout on my second.  I squared it away for my third and hit an 80 lb meet PR.

Attempts:

1. 465lb (211kg) - 3 whites
2. 505lb (230kg) - 3 whites
3.  [530lb (241kg) - 3 whites](https://gfycat.com/halfmetallicdrever)

**Bench**

Team Poverty Bench checking in.  Benching four times per week helped a lot, but my left elbow is trashed.  I've been getting some relief from resisted finger flexion with a rubber band, so I was hammering that between squats and bench.  It held for today but I need a break from benching for a while to heal this.  Hitting 315 in a meet was pretty great, NGL. 40 lb meet PR.

Attempts:

1. 275lb (125kg) - 3 whites
2. 305lb (139kg) - 3 whites
3.  [315lb (143kg) - 2 whites](https://gfycat.com/infantilequeasyaustrianpinscher)

**Deadlift**

I switched to sumo for this meet, with the thinking that I have a higher ceiling using that stance vs conventional.  I trained sumo hard for 12 weeks, but I still have a ways to go to technique-wise.  Nevertheless, everything seemed to move well during warmups.  I almost dropped my second, but I got the down command in time.  My third was a 25 lb meet PR and moved better than my second.  However, I was *this close* to passing out.  Glad I didn't.  

Attempts:

1. 500lb (227kg) - 3 whites
2. 560lb (255kg) - 3 whites
3.  [575lb (261kg) - 3 whites](https://gfycat.com/shadowyqualifiedleopardseal)

**Summary**

RPS runs great meets in New England.  Everything ran on time, there were enough warmup bars and weights, and it's just a fantastic time.  The metal was blasting, everyone was hitting PRs, and for a few hours, everything was okay.  I was worried about going in without a handler, but the ad hoc crew that developed through warmups took good care of me.  I'm very thankful for the community in this sport.  My goals are a 550lb squat and a 600lb deadlift at the Massachusetts State Championship in March.","powerlifting, fitness"
"The idea has been brought up in the past but we figure it might be worth some serious discussion again considering that few (if any?) feds use old Wilks anymore, so should we still use it? 

So considering...

1.We want to stick to a single coefficient formula for the purpose of conformity across flairs, making it easier for comparison.

2.DOTS seems generally the most approved of when new coefficients have been discussed in the past. IPF Points are stupid and new Wilks is far too controversial to say the least.

3.Openpowerlifting, our main resource for results defaults to DOTS.

What do you guys think of switching from Wilks to DOTS as the standard coefficient for flairs?","powerlifting, fitness"

TL;DR 5/9 PR'd every lift and missed 3 chances to get 2k. Got to lift in my home gym, Rochester Performance Gym, with some of my homies.

&#x200B;

Squats: Went 1/3 hit 850 for a 50lb pr. Depth calls were really tough for a Multiply meet so adjustments had to be made. Mid back locked up pretty bad on my opener so I only took a 30lb jump to 880. Felt ok on the pick but called it on the descent. Waived my third which probably salvaged the rest of my day.

Bench: Went 2/3 hit 485 for a 10lb PR. Bench has been a trainwreck for me this training cycle. Got an Overkill Redline in November and haven't been able to figure it out. Switched to a 56 SDP, had more issues, switched to a 58 SDP 2 weeks out and was able to get consistent touches. 465 flew up, misgrooved 485 and had downward motion about halfway up. Retook it and got it.

Deadlift: Went 2/3 hit 644 for a 7 pound PR. Deadlifts are my worst lift but they decided to finally show up today. Opened at 611 and it felt fantastic. Went to 644 and it moved like a second should so I went to 672 to try for 2k. Got it to my knees but ran out of juice and was probably too far forward.

&#x200B;

All in all a great day considering I was just happy to have gotten through the meet.","powerlifting, fitness"
"First - this meet was insanely well-ran. Huge kudos to Sabre and everyone who ran this meet. 

TL;DR hit a 262.5/579 squat, 363/165 bench, and 300/661 deadlift. Lift videos: https://www.instagram.com/p/CPOsC90ASGX/?utm_medium=copy_link

For me this meet was insanely gratifying. It was my first official meet since November of 2019 where I hit a 632.5kg/1394lb total from a 225/496 squat, 142.5/314 bench, and 265/584 dead. That was at 103/226ish bodyweight. 

Then I had a fat-boy winter and got up to 112/247 and hit 687.5/1515 at a mock meet (would’ve been a meet if not for COVID - gyms shut down the day after) from a 255/562 squat, 147.5/325 bench, 285/628 deadlift. 

In October I tried cutting back to 105 but I felt like a skeleton. It was worth it to improve body comp because by July of 2020 I was 115 bw and kinda chonk. Now back to that but much better body comp. Total regressed to 662.5 I think. 

From October to now though, I had a perfectly paced bulk from 103/226 to 115/253 (about 1lb per week for 6 months?) and the best training of my life. Never overshot but also never undershot. Sessions were just hard quality work. They started off boring and well-under all-time PRs, but after about 12 weeks I was hitting sub-max working sets above previous rep-maxes. The biggest thing was that because my sets were not killing me I was able to string together so many more quality blocks. 

Peaking started and I did my same-old tried and true peaking strategy. High volume triples 3wks out, working up to an @9ish triple 2wks out (hit a 252.5/557 squat triple, 152.5/336 bench triple, and a 275/606 deadlift triple), before openers and tapering in the last week. 

On meet day I ate kinda normal in the morning - at 115 I wasn’t in danger of missing 120. Just didn’t pound water til after weigh ins. Squats felt awesome, but were the only lift I missed on. Got too excited for 606/275, stepped out a bit too wide and clipped the rack (spotter pulled the upright into the plates by accident but didn’t catch it after. So it goes), and just ran out of talent on the way up. 

Didn’t feel too bad going into bench but wasn’t hype either. Hit my opener at 331/150 and commands were viciously long so I went with my safe attempts (157.5/346 > 165/363) and hit them easily. 

Deads felt decent but wasn’t sure what to expect. Had never pulled more than 285/628 before today. 272.5/601 flew for an opener so took a decent jump to 287.5/633 without even thinking it was a PR. Brain was completely empty lol just music playing. 287.5 was probably an @8.5 and I really wanted the 1603 total and a 300kg pull so I called it. Ended up being a perfect third and I felt on top of the world. What a day :). 

Was very lucky to have my wife handling me she never missed a beat and had my attempts ready to give to judges as well as communicate with my coach (https://www.instagram.com/s.marko - been with him 2.5 years now. Best total prior was 545/1204 in early
2018. Now it’s 727.5/1603 in mid 2021. That speaks for itself). 

Feel free to ask any questions about training or anything.

" First ever meet in the books. Finished with a 3rd place medal and a hunger to compete that has increased tenfold. Extremely happy and proud that I was able to put up a total I’m fairly impressed with.

Went 9/9, which was my only real goal in this contest. Not sure if I got any red lights, as the three judges just held up sheets of laminated paper since the screen wasn’t working on the platform, lol. I just looked at two of the refs each time and never saw any reds. I really hammered the commands and cadence of the lifts into myself before going into this. 

First squat: 185/407
Second squat: 195/429
Third squat: 207.5/457

All three attempts went up lightning fast. I was playing it a little too safe, I wasn’t sure how the adrenaline would affect me, if the commands would be harder than I anticipated, etc. But i didn’t struggle with these nearly as much as I thought I would which gave me loads of momentum going forwards. I’m fairly certain I could’ve added another 10kg on my final attempt that day, but it’s water under the bridge now.

First bench: 135/297
Second bench: 147.5/325
Third bench: 157.5/347 (first among all 105kg jrs)

Bench was always my strongest lift relative to squat and deads, so I knew this was where I could be aggressive and push myself. Second attempt flew, and I planned to only go up to 152.5 but I had to take advantage of the moment, and I managed to make a perfect choice as 157.5 moved very well. I don’t think I could’ve added any more without an extremely ugly form breakdown. 

First deadlift: 212.5/468.5
Second deadlift: 240/529
Third deadlift: 252.5/556 (16lb PR!)

I actually planned on going with 200kg as an opener but I changed it to 212.5 last minute, so I wouldn’t have had to make any big jumps and I could better set myself up for a YOLO third attempt. This ended up being great as I nailed my third attempt, and secured a perfect 9/9 day.


All in all, this was a BLAST !! I can’t wait to compete again. For now my goal is set to get my total up to qualify for nationals, which in the CPU is 652.5 for junior 105kg. Not a huge leap, but a smaller goal I can set my eyes on for the next couple months. Going forward, I know I have to up my squat, which is good as my deadlift will follow. My bench is fantastic where it is now, which is a huge relief.

"Let me start off by saying I had ZERO IDEA THEY WERE USING POUND PLATES UNTIL I DID MY WEIGH IN. Idk why, but, they did.  Now that that’s out the way:
I decided to take part in this meet back in February. A friend of mine who is a chairman reached out and told me about it. Inviting me to participate. It had been since Dec. 2019 that I did a meet. I was itching to get back on the platform. 

OFF-SEASON:
Very tough. Depression, anxiety, my OCD ALL hit me hard to the point of suicidal thoughts. I also was diagnosed with being in the spectrum. Talk about a rough patch. Decided to get help and then COVID happened. New meds and irregular therapist visits made it hard to stay on track. My weight shot up about 10lbs bc the meds. I also somehow injured my left shoulder to the point I couldn’t do a push-up. With minimal equipment. But at least the basics, I was in a “stay active” program. Nothing heavy, nothing fancy. 

8 MONTHS OUT:
Training started to ramp up and hit a stride. Body felt fresh and ready to hit heavy weight again. My goal was to compete at some point in 2021. So I decided to start sharpening the lifts and build a good base. 
3 MONTHS OUT:
PRs we’re coming in all lifts in both volume and 1rms. Goal was to stay healthy and continue slow progress.  Don’t rush into anything. 
6 WEEKS OUT:
1RM test day. Then went into reload week and prep for the meet started. My final heavy session before the meet was NOT GOOD. I used a different method than I have in my past 2 meets. Instead of only heavy singles, I used Garret Belvins method (https://youtu.be/ggmiPH5y3F8). 
 WEIGH IN DAY:
Woke up at 76.5kg. BC the meet was being held at a school, weigh in was at 4:00pm. I went to a sauna around 2 and did 10min intervals of sauna and hot tub. Checked my scale and it read 73kg. Showered and drove out to the location which was about 75mins away. As I approached the venue I stop at 7-11 to get my rehydration beverages for post weigh in. MY CAR WONT START!!! JUMPER CABLES WONT WORK. ITS JUST DEAD! I call my homeboy and he sends triple a out to help and heads my way. I get an Uber to the venue and make it just in time. Scale reads 159lb/72kg. Success. I eventually get home at 9:00pm that night with only 1 meal in me , a gallon of water, and stress. 

MEET DAY: 
My homeboy rides with me out to the venue and decide we’re gonna just stay focused and keep outside worries away (lost my job 2 weeks out, car issue night before). I grab my air pods and watch my favorite funny videos and memes to get me in a good mood. 
SQUAT- 
Open at 405. Too easy 
Next 420. If this moves fast I’m going for a PR next. It moves excellent 
3rd attempt 460lb. 10lb all time PR 58lb meet PR. FELT AMAZING
BENCH-
Open at 300. New this was cake but was worried about 315 bc my shoulder was very tight. 314 was the record in the state for my weight class. I wanted it. 
Second at 315. Flawless. New record
Third at 330. 5lb all time PR 16lb meet PR.
DEADS-
Open at 485. I lowered my opener 10lbs bc my warmups were ASS. Opener moves better than all my warm ups.  GO Time
Second at 505. Easy money
Third at 530. 5lb all time PR. 18lb meet PR. I honestly think I could’ve pushed and squeaked out 540 in hindsight. 
OVERALL:
Goal was to get as close to 1300total as possible, best overall lifter, take bench record. Mission accomplished.

"I thought i'd write up my experience doing the Texas Method the last 4 months in preparation for my first powerlifting meet. Before that I had ran about 10 weeks of Madcows which brought my lifts from around 235 Squat-> 300, 235 Bench-> 270, 295 Deadlift -> 375. The numbers are so dramatic because prior to that I had just been training once a week S/B and accessories for a few months. And before that hadn't trained seriously for 2 years.

M, 26, 5'7

Weight-> 205->215.

S- 300->374

B- 270-> 308  
D- 375-> 440

The first two weeks I started with the 4 day u/L TM which I enjoyed because of the additional time for specifically upper body accessories to help the bench, but due to scheduling I switched to the 3 day. I started about 2 weeks after finishing madcows and just did light work/deloaded as my bench and deadlift stalled out, but my squat had still been going up steadily.

I trained bench M/F and press W without rotating them out. I also subbed out pc for a deadlift variation. I did the first 4 weeks with RDL's 3x5. Then Did 4 weeks of speed deadlifts with chains 8x3 at 225. Then took a deload, did 3 weeks of 8x1 Sumo deadlifts, then stopped doing a deadlift variation altogether as I had finals coming up and built up fatigue that wasn't allowing me to recover fully, specifically my lower back since I low bar squat too. I also incorporated 3x8 at the end of my volume day for flat db bench, which I occassionally switched out for low incline db bench. I also usually added some tricep pushdowns on friday. I found that I really needed this extra volume on upper body in order to keep progressing and my upper body was able to recover fine no matter how much extra I added.

 I have microplates so I would usually progress 2.5lbs a week on bench, starting with a top set of 5 at 245 week one, I had to drop to 2x3 at 270 on week 7. By week 10 I was down to 3x2 at 280. Week 8 I deloaded doing cgbp for intensity, and volume with larsen press. I also did halting deadlifts that week for intensity to deload, no deadlift variation on monday, lowered the volume/weight for squat and did Safety Squat bar for intensity. 

&#x200B;

For squat I also had to drop down to 2x3 on week 10 to progress, and I started week 1 at 1x5 275 and week 10 was 2x3 at 335. 

&#x200B;

Deadlift I had to drop to 1x3 at 375 on week 7, same as bench, while i started week 1 at 1x5 at 330. 

By week 14, my 3rm to use as openers were 345/285/405. 

&#x200B;

Thoughts- I think the program is really good as long as you can make the correct modifications to it to run it as long as possible. The main modifications I think that helped me with it are-

 1) dropping down from a 5rm to a 3/2/1 to keep progressing. 

2) Using a deadlift variation instead of powercleans.

3) Adding upper body volume- In addition to db bench and tricep work, I would ocassionally add extra sets of bench to my intensity day, or adding in cgbp or larsen after my volume work. 

4) Only pressing on light days, Bench M/F. 

5) taking deloads when you need to. This was a good experience for me to listen to my body and there were 2 or 3 occassions where I would get to deadlift and almost fail at 365 which was my last warmup. I knew then to take a deload the next week and I would use lighter variations of the lifts like SSB, swiss bar bench, halting deadlift, CGBP as well as lower the volume

6) Not listening to the volume % offset for squats. I found that for bench the prescribed 5x5 is fine but I absolutely cannot do whatever the % was recommended, like 90% of ID I think. I stayed around 75% of ID and was able to progress fine that day, any higher and its absolutely brutal when I tried it and always ended up tweaking something and needing a deload the next week. 

&#x200B;

I also found doing front squats on light day for a heavy 3x3 never taxed me too hard and surprisingly helped my deadlift a bit. 

All in all, I am going to be doing a HLM type program with slower progression as I cannot really progress weekly anymore. After a certain point, even with the deloads, having to go in and pr every week for SBD on the same day was mentally exhausting and wore me out a lot. When I had exams or was trying to stay around the same weight for my meet, I noticed I just wasn't able to recover very well from it at all. Another issue I have is that deadlift:squat ratio, I think adding in a deadlift variation on monday helped but it just felt bad to only have one real set of deadlifts per week, as opposed to 8 of squats counting front squats. Deadlift is my favorite lift and im much better at it than squatting, so I think I would've been better off using some more energy on deadlifting, however with how much squatting the program has, when I tried to add back off sets to my deadlift I'd end up being too fatigued for the next week. Overall, I'd highly reccommend trying it out if you can still progress week to week, and watching this video on it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QyYU56cj\_A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QyYU56cj_A) as this is how I was able to rotate the rep ranges and even gave me a guide to use for peaking.","powerlifting, fitness"

"**TLDR: Did my first meet..went 7/9 ..didnt really meet expectations but learned alot**

**Background: I was just a fat kid that played video games until i got tired of being bullied and started working in late 8th grade. Lost weight over the summer and ended up really enjoying lifting and working out. Found larry wheels on yt and discovered PL. Started wrestling freshmen yr but got hurt, then decided after recovering i want to be a powerlifter.**

**Meet Prep**

I had a coach so that I could master tech and not get snapped up. Meet prep went really well. Ended up hitting a 375 Lowbar squat (grinder), 205 paused bench and 210 tng bench, 425 conventional deadlift for a 1005 total. I was hoping to to hit a 1k total and go 9/9

**Meet Day**

First meet but the gym I work at hosted it which is cool. No real probs here.

**Squats**

**1st attempt. 150: super easy. I miscalced and took 325 lbs as my last warmup**

2nd attempt 160: also easy: this was about what I hit for my last warm when i hit 375 in training

3rd attempt 170: not bad at all. Way easier than training.

**Bench Press**

**1st attempt. 80: easy. I opened my flight which was a little unnerving**

2nd attempt 87.5: moved decently. no comments

3rd attempt 92.5: .Missed because my butt came up. strength was there but tech was off. I know i have to work on that now.

**Deadlift**

**1st attempt. 170: Decent: this was a little slow. I was def tired at this point**

2nd attempt 180: Slow: pretty tired by this point. not a bad rep but def a little slow

3rd attempt 190: Failed. I was out of gas and couldnt break the floor. (im slow off the floor and fast at lockout)

**Recap**

My first meet and I learned a lot. I know ive got to get better at bench technique, gpp and deadlift technique. Technically won a gold medal because i was the only 16/17 guy there but idc about that..practically a participation medal. Had lots of fun and i am only more motivated to get back in the gym and training.","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background and Training**

Videos: [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/COGJn9wAta4/)

5’6/27/M, this is meet number 12 for me, after about 9 months since my last meet. Still running my own programming, as it’s done pretty well for me thus far. Leading up to this meet, I finished prep with a 690lb squat double, 475lb bench single, and 645lb deadlift single. Squat was going fantastically this meet prep which is why (spoiler alert) i was a bit disappointed with my squat performance in the meet. This was just a small, local meet, meant to act as a “tune up” before I go to Texas this fall to compete in the Pioneer Open. 

I actually chose this weekend to compete, hoping to make it off the wait list for the Kern, but that didn’t happen, so I competed locally anyway.

**Meet Prep**

This meet prep was a little longer than usual for me. 21 weeks instead of 14, just to give myself an extra cycle of being serious about my training. I took my standard 2 week taper, deadlift and squat openers 10 days out, and bench opener a week out. No injuries this prep, so that was a huge positive, but personal reasons ended up eliminating a lot of drive and motivation to train/compete. I’m not one to quit, though, so i stuck through with the program, even if it was the bare minimum sometimes.

Easily made weight this time around with a water load and a sauna. Didn’t take anywhere as long as usual. Weighed in at 197, rebounded to 208ish by the evening. Nothing to see here.

Meet goals: Whatever PRs I needed to get to a 1900+ total.

**The Lifts**

7/10. Didn’t do too well with my third attempts this time around. 

**Squat**

666LB/302.5KG, make: I took something that was heavy, but something I’ve tripled. This is the heaviest opener I’ve taken, and I smoked it, so I thought big things were in store for my squat.

705LB/320KG, make: So, this weight did NOT move like it should have! It really slowed down, and honestly, this is where I should have stopped. I had a plan though, and I stuck with it. This lift ties a meet PR, although this one was walked out.

722LB/327.5KG, miss: I knew as soon as a stood up with the weight that this was going to be too heavy, and too heavy it was. Got it up just to my sticking point, and the spotters caught me. Put it away, and I thanked everyone for keeping me alive.

**Bench**

463LB/210KG, make: Bench is usually the only part of the meet where I’m relaxed and stress free, but warm ups felt unusually heavy, and I didn’t have the comfort of having my “own hand off” guy as I’ve had in past meets. So I found a friend who had actually traveled to Nashville to watch the meet, quickly taught him how I like my hand offs, and went from there. 463 was loaded, nearly mis-loaded, as they forgot a red plate (the only thing my bench press and Julius’ have in common). But it came down, went back up.

485LB/220KG, make: Feels like gravity was increased a bit here. Not sure if I was zapped from squats, or if the awkward fast press command threw me off, but this weight moved a lot slower than it should have. Again, should have passed on my third after this attempt, saved the energy for deads.

496LB/225KG, miss: Weight was heavy. I missed it. Not even close.

Sub-total going into deads: 1190lbs.

**Deadlift**

633LB/287.5KG, make: Deadlifts consistently peak well for me, and this meet was no different. Opened 10lbs below my training max, and it moved like an opener should. I had a full power total.

672LB/305KG, make: Took a little bit higher of a jump than planned, in hopes of keeping my total close to my last meet’s total at this point. This weight moved nearly as quickly as my opener, so it was time to go for a PR.

689LB/312.5KG, make: I did everything the same way, just like practice. Grabbed the bar, and… it moved surprisingly well! Pulling this allowed me to tie my last meet total. Also pulling this was an 11lb all time PR for me.

699.96LB/317.5KG, miss: So Pete Rubish kind of talked me into going for a fourth attempt. Said something about being disappointed if I potentially left a milestone like 700lbs on a day where deadlifts were moving so well. Turns out, though, that four deadlift maxes make the body pretty tired, and although I gave it my all, it only got to my knees this time. No regrets for giving it a try though!

**Results**

Totaled 1879LB/852.5KG, going 7/10, and made a PR for deadlift. Ties my last meet total. I placed first overall, but best lifter went to the raw lifter due to limited number of classic raw lifters at this meet.

My final thoughts: this meet was a little bit of a shit show. The venue was WAY too small. There was no space for the lifters to warm up without being on top of each other, and without running into folks in the audience. Maybe going alone to this meet made things a lot harder than it should have for me, but I could hardly keep up with where we were in the meet, and there was only one projector with the lifter order, across the gym from the warm up area. And the awards ceremony took nearly an hour. USPA seriously needs to find a way to fix that. 
Now i’m taking this week off to just decompress from powerlifting, before i roll right into my next meet prep.","powerlifting, fitness"

"**PREP**

I took a decently long offseason of 22 weeks after my last meet in October. I was feeling pretty burnt out at that point, and 2 of my lifts did not progress leading into last meet. Really dialing things back seemed to help me a lot, and I think I was able to perform much better with the 22 weeks between comps, instead of trying to squeeze in 2 meets in that time frame. I'm coached by Erik /u/agent21emh and he's been instrumental in helping me become a much better powerlifter. 

**MEET**

Used the water cut guide from /u/rawrylynch (https://sisyphusstrength.com/blog/2018/6/25/how-to-water-cut-like-a-pro) to manipulate my water/sodium levels to cut from about 85kg, and ended up weighing in at 82.4kg. Check in at the meet was very smooth and I was able to weigh in just after 7 AM. My rehydration went very well, and I was feeling pretty good to warm up by the time 8:30 rolled around. My session at the meet was only 1 flight with 8 lifters, so I was anticipating that the meet would move very quickly from this point on.

**SQUAT** 

ATTEMPT 1: 202.5kg/446 lbs 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/12bmy2ashqPOOzRI8YbEEbCeqaVJ7C3jw/view?usp=sharing

Squats were not feeling very great during warm-ups. I hit a sticking point just out of the hole for some reason, but I Was able to get through that and complete the lift. Our goal coming into this meet involved me going 3/3 on squats, so Erik and I decided to go conservative with my 2nd attempt, and added 7.5 kg. Good lift

ATTEMPT 2: 210kg/463 lbs

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bZ9KA138wyQpBbE9ah_kuoSUOc3-Lf15/view?usp=sharing

This ended up feeling and moving better than my opener. I widened my stance just a hair from my fist attempt, and I think that helped me move the weight smoother. Decided to add 5kg for my 3rd instead of really reaching for another 2.5kg. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 215kg/474 lbs



https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s9BEi7OSYfQbuWqgJtQO5IUzG63_wIuE/view?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gIy4dOkhQS_G8ZPGZID5_k9j0s0NUjer/view?usp=sharing

This is 2.5kg under my best all time squat, but I'm still happy with it. Powerlifting is about the total, not just the squat, and in my opinion, as soon as you can focus on your total instead of crushing each individual lift and maybe reaching for things that aren't there, you will become a much more well-rounded lifter. Was able to hit this through a decent grind, good lift.

**BENCH PRESS** 

ATTEMPT 1: 140kg/308 lbs

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VpB_6M3TIN8JaHdxDusNcmwd1h5pRUXF/view?usp=sharing

I'm not sure what it is about the Ohio Power Bar, but I consistently bench much better using that instead of other power bars. This was the easiest the this eight has ever moved for me, honestly felt like an RPE 5.5-6 when I'm used to this being around an 8. Good lift

ATTEMPT 2: 147.5kg/326 lbs

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVMq8CBPhgnoO4xNMRPqHpPSye-_5ko2/view?usp=sharing

Again, this moved better than this weight ever has for me. After my opening bench, I was pretty confident I could hit something big today, and this attempt really reinforced that. Good lift.

ATTEMPT 3: 155kg/342 lbs



https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LMI5_GAkzi8zkSCBD0YwOsZJ3IycawpD/view?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1czHuGwhCa70tsFHXlwXfE0RCIA5LVD2m/view?usp=sharing

2.5kg all time PR here, I MAYBE had another 2.5kg but I was very happy with this. Our planned 3rd attempt bench was 152.5kg/336 lbs, but we both knew after my 2nd attempt that this weight was no doubt. Good lift.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 227.5kg/502 lbs

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eBXLlBGv0VhD-uP4sFmhdvT6A7Cxsa50/view?usp=sharing

I made the switch to conventional after my last meet. I'd pulled sumo for 5 meets at that point and it just honestly never really felt right. My adductors were destroyed and I could never train sumo for more than about 8 weeks before I ran out of steam, even at 1x week frequency. It was difficult at first trying to get my technique to a point where I felt strong, but my first sets with conventional leading up to this were with 335 pounds for a set of 6. Like I said, really dialing things back ended up helping me a lot in the long run. Good lift here.


ATTEMPT 2: 240kg/529 lbs

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zk5WGrEaZIo5EEHbQJYggen5eJ9ihCrd/view?usp=sharing

I'll give you some more context. April of 2019 I set a sumo deadlift PR of 235kg/518 lbs. I wasn't able to hit more than that until October of 2020, when I hit 237.5kg/523 lbs. 18 months between sumo PRs. This 2nd attempt here, conventional, was a PR just 22 weeks after my last meet. Good lift.

ATTEMPT 3: 250kg/551 lbs



https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOjmSALVj8Ii66bAF6kdZzBMlRib9T52/view?usp=sharing
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0ibS9zEvt3kMJbJ8_aMTiRTO9fHlO-W/view?usp=sharing

12.5kg PR here. We originally called for 247.5kg, but after going back to the warmup room and taking a second, I knew I could really push myself here and go for broke so we upped the attempt. It's honestly a miracle I got this lift. I sort of abandoned my technique and cues because I was lost in the hype. This was the last pull of the session so most of the other lifters were out there to support. It almost felt like a pre-covid competition, as lifters were allowed a handler and a spectator here. It's times like this pull that I really step back and realize how much I love powerlifting.

**RESULTS**

Ended up 9/9 (620kg/1368lbs total) with 2.5kg Bench press PR, 12.5kg deadlift PR, and 17.5kg total PR. This was my last meet as a Junior, and I really think it was my best prep I've had. I have learned a lot about the best way for myself to prepare for competition, and I'm excited to take that knowledge forward.
 

**WHAT'S NEXT**

I'm going to plan on competing sometime in the fall or winter I think. I'm going to focus on co-directing my first meet with Erik on July 24th, which I'm extremely excited for. I have much more competition now that I'm entering the Open class, so I'm looking forward to those challenges.","powerlifting, fitness"
"first meet recap (repost since I didn't have a flair, hopefully it works correctly this time.)

So I’ve never done one of these bare with me, long time lurker first time poster.

I had never even thought I’d ever be competing but thanks to a friend from the commercial gym I was at I learned of this one back in June. Anyhow on to the recap I went 9/9 and I believe I got all white lights on all attempts! All attempts were new state record as well as the overall total for the mens 100kg open class. My 3rds are all linked here ([https://www.instagram.com/inspiring\_vision/](https://www.instagram.com/inspiring_vision/)) most recent post as of me posting this.

Squat: 240kg/540.1lbs, 255kg/562.2lbs, 262.5kg/578.7lbs

They all felt pretty good but my third definitely felt a bit heavy on my back and I just couldn’t get as stable as I wanted. I feel like I maybe had 5ishkg in my. 15lb PR.

Bench: 162.5 kg/ 358.2lbs, 170kg/374.8lbs, 175kg/385.8lbs

Ive been dealing with a shoulder injury for about 4 years and this is by far the best my bench has felt ever, I feel like I had another 7.5-10kg in the tank but I understood the call. 20lbs PR.

Deads: 275kg/606.3lbs, 287.5kg/633.8lbs, 297.5/655.9lbs

This is my money lift but immediately going into the second attempt I got the worst cramps of my life. So we pulled back a bit and went conservative. I’ve hit 675 fairly easily before but I not sure what I had left in the tank due to cramps.

Total: 735kg/1620.4lbs good for 1st place in the mens open 220lbs/100kg class. I had an awesome time and I definitely want to compete again. I don’t think I could have asked for a better first meet. Also I've been into the ""powerlifting style"" training for about 3.5 years (15ish years of total training time), no specific program just lifting as heavy as possible on the compound lifts hitting each one at least twice a week. About 3 months ago I found a powerlifting gym and a coach here in Hawaii and he helped me a ton by getting my technique to a much better point on all lifts and an actual program to follow.","powerlifting, fitness"
"First time poster, so go easy on me please. 

I'd like to emphasize I am not intermittent fasting to lose weight, I'm actually at a great weight to compete rn. I'm doing it for the supposed health benefits outside of lifting. 

I'm a fairly experienced powerlifter, been training for about 4 years or so, 24M. Recently starting IFing, 16 hour fast only eating from 12-8pm. Basically all I did was stop eating breakfast, and eating the same calories (as extra) within my eating window. Been doing it for about 3 weeks now, and I feel good, but my lifts (especially higher volume days) have been feeling progressively weaker. Has anyone else experienced this? As far as I'm aware, I'm eating the same total number of calories, so I'm not sure why I'd be weaker. I have been getting slightly leaner despite not being in a deficit (maybe down 3-4 lbs since I started).","powerlifting, fitness"

"**TL;DR**

First meet. Good personal numbers (217.5 KG/152.5 KG/230 KG). Uh...that is all.


**BACKGROUND** 

So... bear with me it's my first time writing one of these things! Basically, I've been planning out this meet for almost a year. I really wanted to take my time and establish a good strength base before rushing into a meet and hitting numbers I wasn't happy with. Prep had a LOT of ups and downs, self-doubt, and a lack of self-confidence... but when the kilos come on and the bar was loaded, I knew that the hours upon hours of analyzing my form, writing shit down, talking to my coach, and overall progression had paid off.



**TRAINING**

There was....a LOT of bumps on this ride. I'll start in order with my squats. Squats actually progressed pretty well the first couple of blocks. Then, as I got closer to prep, it ended up CRASHING. AND. BURNING. I'm talkin' groin injuries, I'm talkin' hip injuries, and warmup sets becoming working sets. Luckily damage control was a success near the end of prep. The main lesson I learned was that I cannot rush steady progress. I need to listen to my body when it's time to take the foot off the gas. I very well believed I could've hit a 226 KG+ squat for an attempt 3 if I had taken the proper precautions. I'm glad I learned this lesson now instead of years from now. 

Bench was definitely my most consistent lift throughout prep. Not much to say other than I really want to get 165.5 KG soon. Bench just kind of clicks for me most of the time. Even if I feel exhausted or unmotivated during a training day. I will say that the main takeaway from my bench is keeping my ass on the bench at all times. I'm going to re-evaluate cues so I don't have to use ""explosive"" leg drive on the press (Instead, keeping lots of quad tension throughout the lift). 

Deadlifts were also consistent. I experimented with sumo a bit at the beginning of prep and the blocks preceding prep. I plan to take a couple of blocks in the off-season to perfect it. With that being said, those few months of trying to learn sumo might have been the best thing to happen to my conventional deadlift. For the LONGEST time, I could never get slack-pull correct in my conventional position. And as I learned sumo for the first time, the lat activation came naturally. When I used the slack pull techniques in a conventional position, I managed to add 20+ KG onto my pulls in a short amount of time. I really want to get my sumo to the same level as my conventional and have the ability to pull both. 


**NUTRITION** 

No complaints about dieting or cutting. In fact, for most of the prep, I was underweight. As the meet neared I got up to 99 KG so I just did a slight week-long water cut to get down to 97 flat. I managed to get in and out for the weigh-in and equipment check. Weighed in with my clothes on (which I'm not used to since I've always had to diet hard whenever I needed to meet a weight requirement). 97 KG Flat for the meet.


**THE MEET** 

Not going to ramble on too long about the venue or anything. I will say that I loved the gym (shoutout to Rochester Performance Gym) and that everybody who showed up couldn't have been any nicer to me! Very kind and supportive atmosphere at the meet.

**RESULTS**

8/9, 1st Place 100 KG Teen Junior, State Bench Record, And a bunch of qualifiers. 

First place for the first meet! There was only one other 100 KG Teen there so uh....asterisk. But I'm glad I managed to hit what I wanted to. 8/9 not too shabby for the first time around. I honestly think I could've hit a mid-340 to 350 lb bench if I had gotten that first attempt, but besides that, it was a perfect day. Managed to get a master's teen total and a class one Junior 20-23 total. I plan to compete again at IPL North American Champs in Texas in November (hopefully there will be more 100 KG juniors to compete against). This first meet really gave me the confidence I desperately needed. It's time to recover, locking these next few months, and put 100% into my program. Thank you to all who answered questions in the various threads I posted in! 

See you guys in November for the next meet report!




*EDIT 1: Accidentally put weight-class instead of actual BW for the title. Weighed in at 97 KG flat which is what I used to calculate DOTS.*","powerlifting, fitness"
"Meet #7. That is hard to believe, since I vividly remember writing up my first meet in September 2017. The years don't stop comin', etc. I've written up all the other ones, so HERE WE GO AGAIN

**Prep/Background/Blah Blah**

So, this meet was a complete outlier: I didn't prep. I didn't do a peak, I just saw it on the APF calendar when I was renewing my membership for a wrapped meet in November, and thought hell...I haven't competed in sleeves since May 2018. My coach and my bf, who are officially the only two people outside of me who have any say in my training at this point, both thought it was a not-that-crazy idea, so I pulled the trigger and registered. I didn't tell anyone. I just decided to do it, treat it as a combined max effort training day, and roll into my prep for November.  I really enjoy competing, and I wanted to feel that again before I got into a ""serious"" prep.

Maybe it's a little weird to keep it secret, but after the bad juju I felt from my October 2020 meet (which, don't get me wrong, was a very strong day and I'm proud of that total) I just wanted to compete FOR ME. Nobody else. Nobody else's business but mine. Just a chance to show myself what I'm capable of just from my normal training, and most importantly, to have fun competing to remind myself why I love getting on the platform. That October meet wasn't a fun experience for me for a wide variety of reasons that had nothing to do with the actual lifting, which made the actual lifting not the victory it should have been. I narrowed my circle significantly as a direct result of what went down in and around that meet, which I don't regret for a second, and I think I'm a better lifter for it. I'm also a happier person. I've always been a solo lifter, but I've gotten wiser about where I look for support. There's been a lot more headphones-in, head-down training the last eight months, and it is paying dividends.

As for actual lifting, I have trained conjugate since summer 2018 and I will continue as long as my body lets me. I have made two significant changes: I switched back to squatting in lifters and my coach gave me a TON of heavy conventional work. My hips were immediately thankful for switching to lifters and my deadlift training has been absolute gangbusters all year as a result of the extra conventional, so definitely two big positives.

After that last meet, I got sick with not-covid, followed by actual covid, and started a stimulant medication for ADHD. Those things combined meant I lost almost 20 lbs from my walking around weight before the meet. So, I got serious about nutrition, since I knew I had to come to grips with the fact that nutrition and not meeting my muscular potential in my weight class were holding me back, and because I needed to put a lot of weight back on. I started up with Andi Ramirez at Hybrid Nutrition and I've been lean and holding steady at 181ish since about April, and my training numbers have been steadily climbing, even in maintenance. I eat so much protein now. Good lord, so many protons.

**THE MEET**

West Indy Barbell is a super cool facility, loads of specialty equipment, and they managed to pull off hosting a meet *the same week they moved buildings*. Their AC went out right after move-in, but it wasn't overly hot the day of the meet and my home gym has been running 90+ inside, so I was physically prepared for that. This was their first all-women's meet and it was small, which meant there was just one flight of us and we moved FAST. From the time I started stretching for squat warm ups to sitting in a chair for awards was four hours on the dot. I gather I'm something of an outlier for a raw lifter because I prefer longer meets over super short ones, but fortunately the volume I have for my normal training set me up well, and I've got my between-lift snacks nailed (the answer to everything is PB&J and bananas). It moved so quick I really didn't have a chance to crash.  The West Indy crew was super nice and I definitely recommend visiting them to train if you're in the area, or for an APF meet in the future. Judging was fair and consistent with other APF meets I've been to/done myself.

**SQUAT - 3/3** [vids](https://imgur.com/a/a7v0rnF)

So, as I said, I haven't pushed a sleeved squat single in literally years, so I had no clue what I'd get. I opened with a relatively conservative 300 since I tripled that about five weeks prior to the meet. Fun story, during deadlifts, they announced their computer had spit out plate loads for a 45 lb bar rather than a 55, so all our squats were ten lbs heavier than we thought. Let this be a lesson about the power of the human brain and deception: I thought my 310 was 300, and moved it like 300; I thought my third was 340, and hot damn, it was 350.

1. 310 - smoke.
2. 335 - felt harder than it should've been because I braced like a doofus, but a 10 lb sleeved PR from a couple weeks ago and still pretty easy.
3. 350 - SMOKE. I actually posted the wrong video in my IG post about meet because it looked just like the other reps. 25 lb lifetime PR, 85 lb platform PR for sleeves. Apparently I could have gone another 10-15 lbs heavier, which is a HUGE confidence boost rolling into heavy wraps training.

Immediately after this victory, I got the dumbest powerlifting injury of all time by hyperextending my right thumb trying to get out of my knee sleeves. I am VERY right-handed and I hook grip, so I was uh, concerned. But no one saw me do it or heard the ""pop"" I did, so I just pretended it didn't happen and figured I'd deal with it later :P Again, the power of the human mind hahaha (it is currently all bruisy and swollen and I may be headed to the doctor oops)

**BENCH - 1/3** [vids](https://imgur.com/a/ZLUbpuv)

lol. This was a good lesson. I opened at 175, which I knew would be easy, and thought ""I can make the jump to 195 to try for a 5 lb platform PR."" Narrator: no, she cannot. I read earlier in the week that 10% is roughly the highest successful jump lifters make from 1sts to 2nds, and here I was going up by more than that. I know better than this--in theory. But I'm glad to have learned this lesson on a day where I wasn't specifically gunning for a particular total, so this is just kind of a big oh well. Opening at 180 and jumping to this would have been better, or staying at 175 and going 185 or 190. Things to play with.  I am going to make some changes to my bench set up to fix the cramping issue, too.

1. 175 - easy, but I felt the specter of the lat/erector cramps that have murdered me now 6/7 meets. oh lawd they comin...
2. 195 - I cramped as soon as I unracked. I got it halfway back up and just didn't have any more lat to push through.
3. 195 - this time, cramp didn't hit til I got the press command. How nice. But like I said, oh well. Live to lift another day and do a smarter thing next time.

**DEADLIFT - 3/3** [vids](https://imgur.com/a/GWFh2tg)

I went aggressive (I thought) with my opener and was a little nervous with how crampy my bench felt, but then I started warming up and I thought lol nah we good. Zero grip issues with the stupid thumb either. Hook grip, you're the real MVP.

1. 375 - looked like a last warmup. This was a 3rd attempt in November 2019.
2. 400 - also pretty easy. 3rd attempt last October. In the video it looks like I go up-down, because I heard ""down"" half-a-second before my bf yelled ""hold"" and tried to do both :P but I had white lights.
3. 410 - 10 lb lifetime PR, 3 whites, and I am truly unsure which muscles actually got me to lockout. I have to assume my brain. When it got sticky I remember thinking ""there is no effing way I'm failing this unless I actually die"" and my vision went almost entirely dark, but I GOT THE MF PULL.

This was also a pee PR. I don't know what happened other than I was very well hydrated, but I managed to pee on the platform every single pull. And, somehow, I was the only woman in an all women's meet who did so. SMH can't take me anywhere.

**TOTAL - 935 lbs @ 179.5 bw (best lifter)** [IG meet report post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSkW5sQLrxl/) and [a squat examination](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSnYY4aAuow/)

That is a...218 lb PR from my last sleeved meet. HAHAHAHA

This meet did exactly what it was supposed to: give me positive momentum going into the wrapped meet I'm doing in November. It was a HUGE psychological boost, and old me is very salty I walked into a meet with no prep and totaled what I did even with a garbage performance on bench (ha!). So I got a couple PRs, got to enjoy competing and help some of the other girls in warm ups and between lifts, and got to eat really delicious food before and after. (If you go to Indy, go to Mama Carolla's and get the rosemary chicken lasagna. Trust me here.) All in all, success, and now I feel ready to prep for meet #8.

ETA: so I sprained my thumb and they put me in a brace. And I still successfully hook gripped. So you too can hook 😜","powerlifting, fitness"
"Yesterday, I competed in my first ever meet (no need to hit a qualifying total here for SJ nationals). I had about eight weeks to prepare, because confirmation of nationals was postponed because of the Covid-19 situation here in the Netherlands. Prep went alright, but I had to peak pretty quickly due to first having to recover from detraining a bit during lockdown.   


# The Meet

Weighed in at 91.74kg, ate around 1800 calories and warmed up for squats. In prep I had squatted 205kg while fatigued at around RPE 9 so I was hoping for 210/215. First attempt of 195 went as it should so I moved up to 205, which moved great too, way faster than in prep. Third was 215 and I got it with a little left in the tank. All three attempts were National Records for -93kg SJ, third attempt was an 8,5kg PR.

Bench warmups felt a bit off because I hadn't benched in four days, in hindsight I should've moved my last bench taper training closer to the meet. First attempt of 128kg flew, so took 135 for a second. Second moved as it should and I moved up to a conservative 140 which went well. Again all three lifts were national records in my class. I had paused 140 before so no PRs here unfortunately, it did move a bit better this time though.

My first deadlift attempt of 210 felt a bit rough, so lowered my planned second by 2.5kg (more of a psychological move), opted for a bit more hype than might be expected for a second attempt and I smoked 227.5kg. After watching this back quickly after the lift I decided to try and chip the national deadlift record for my class by 1kg, which would also put me at a 601kg total. Hyped myself up to an extend I've never done before and it moved surprisingly fast, ending my first meet successfully and resulting in a 10kg deadlift PR aswell.

I went 9/9 with zero red lights which was my main goal, and I built a pretty decent total, qualifying myself for Worlds sj -93kg in September. Very happy about this first meet experience, and excited to build on this towards Worlds.

"My stats prior to beginning Jeff Nippard’s 4x Powerbuilding Program

* 27 years old, 150lbs
* Squat: 510x1
* Bench: 360x1
* Deadlift: 565x1

---

I ran this program after a 4 month bulk. I compete in powerlifting at 148lbs and ended up getting up to 165lbs before deciding it was time to cut again. 

* This program splits weeks, with odd weeks being more powerlifting focused and heavier weights. The even weeks were an upper/lower split, which I liked the change of pace each week. It breaks up the monotony most programs have.
* Ate at a deficit (obviously) but calorie cycled and ate at or close to maintenance during the odd weeks and a bigger deficit for the even weeks. This way I could perform better during the heavier lifting days
* Supplements: Vegan protein (no I’m not vegan, just digests better), creatine, fish oil, and vitamin D

**Results**

* While his program allows you to go for a new 1RM, he also states that unless you’re a powerlifter and have experience doing a 1RM to do an AMRAP at 90%. Although I’m a PL, I elected to just do the AMRAP because they’re more fun and I’m not competing at the moment.
* He also programs to do the AMRAP days with 1-2 days of rest in between, but I’m going out of town so I did them all on the same day, one after the other and all within 45min.
* Bodyweight: 150lbs this morning
*Squatted 455x6 reps, E1RM=528lbs (+18)
*Benched 325x3 reps, E1RM=344lbs (-16)
*Deadlifted 495x6 reps, E1RM=575lbs (+10)


**Thoughts:**

* I genuinely enjoyed this program. While my bench took a big hit, I’m really happy with how my squat and deadlift turned out all while losing weight for summer.
* The back and forth from PL weeks to upper/lower weeks made me look forward to training each week, and having 8 years under my belt it’s hard for me to stay hungry to keep getting after it
* I really liked the “Arm & Pump Day” that was optional to do on Saturdays during the PL week...takes me back to my bro lifting days when I first started
* The 4x a week was a great option for me since I was eating in a deficit. It gave me plenty of time to recover. If I were to run this on a bulk, I’d definitely do the 5-6x week program.
* 8/10 and would recommend others give it a shot. The program isn’t that expensive and it’s a nice change of pace from the other programs usually posted here.
*Not sure what I’m going to do next. Probably Simple Jackd 2.0 while on maintenance, then start bulking while running THE UNITY from Meadows and Tate, and then SBS RTF. I like incorporating more bodybuilding stuff and I want to run a Meadows program before SBS...any recommendations?

--- 

**tl;dr: Ran this on a cut while losing 15lbs, “increased” (didn’t test actual 1RM) my squat and deadlift but my bench suffered. 8/10 and would recommend.","powerlifting, fitness"
"A bit late but had not really come around yet to writing this up. Prep went good, but I had to cut about 3.5kgs water weight which is more than I had to cut for Nationals. I underestimated this by a bit and combined with the stress from traveling and the extreme speed that the meet was run at I performed worse than I would've liked. Nevertheless, we took what was there on meet day and I'm an amazing experience richer. It was truly an honour to compete at the biggest stage there is, we can only improve from here on out.

# THE MEET

**Squats**

1. 212,5kg - this was 2,5kg under my previous meet PR and it moved reasonably well. I had squatted 220 in training @ 8 so I knew this was there on any given day.  
2. 222,5kg - We took the planned 10kg jump and this also moved okay, not as fast as I would have liked, next jump would be 2,5 or 5kg. I had planned for 230+ but the water cut took its toll.  
3. 225kg - Wow. Really glad we did not jump 5 kg. RPE 11.

**Bench**

1. 132,5kg - 2,5kg under my planned opener as warm-ups felt slow. Bench was not there that day. This is probably because of the water cut and a sub-optimal taper. New data though. Moved as an opener should.  
2. 137,5kg - Planned 5kg jump, moved okay.  
3. 142,5kg - 2,5kg meet PR, but hit this in training @ 8.5 and it moved slightly worse even. Next meet big PR.

**Deadlift**

1. 242,5kg - Moved fast. Deads went great this prep.  
2. 257,5kg - 11,5kg meet PR. Moved good too, third was going to be a pull for deadlift bronze.  
3. 267,5kg - Ugly lift, but I got it up. Red lights were expected. Don't know why I hitched it up, strength was just not there at lockout. We have things to work on now.

&#x200B;

Overall pretty happy, we did what was possible on meet day, too bad I missed the deadlift but well, cannot win them all. Moving up to -105 and competing again in December at Europeans. I love the sport.","powerlifting, fitness"
"So I posted this thread \~3 years ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/atnu7t/top\_powerlifters\_who\_disappeared/](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/atnu7t/top_powerlifters_who_disappeared/)) and it gained quite good traction so why not revisit?

It's a little depressing, but also cool to remember some of the big name lifters out there who only some years ago were all anyone was talking about like a Haack today and now have effectively disappeared.

Of course you can check out the last thread but to throw some names out there -  Derek Kendall, Pozdeev, Belyaev, Malanichev, Vince Urbank, Kade Weber, Jamie Lewis, George Leeman, Eric Spoto, Jeremy Hamilton and many more.

Also, partly why I thought to re-do this thread, RIP Chris Hickson who passed away recently.

I'll kick off - at one time Derek Kendall was an absolute monster and then he just sort of disappeared. Dude was squatting like 900, front squatting 800, pulling 8-900. Just massive numbers (I could be slightly misremembering).","powerlifting, fitness"

"Hopefully this'll stay up. I at least think it's a bigger discussion than goes on in the daily thread. 

So I'm wondering with the (for now temporary) exit of USAPL from the IPF how much it affects the followers of the sport.

My biggest gripe with untested powerlifting has always been the lack of competition. All that seems to be on the line is all time world records. Small meets where almost no one seems to be in the same weight class and if you don't get the ATWR it seems like fans regard it as a bit of a failure. The lifters aren't there to win the meet but to get a record.

Watching IPF worlds always has some weight classes where you have 2-3-4 lifters battling it out for the gold. The world records don't really matter there (for me at least). It's a head to head competition for the win and I'm a bit sad that I won't see any US lifters at Worlds this year.

Now my point, the IPF one feels more like watching a real sport to me (especially equipped which adds a whole other level of uncertainty). What is the best part of powerlifting to you? A sport that needs on site competition or ATWR set at small meets with less or no competition? or are you just content with watching highlight reels on Instagram?","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Do you like having 2-3 sweaty men shoe-horn you into polyester, canvas or denim bondage gear.**

**Do you like having your joints wrapped so tightly they bruise and bleed?** 

**Do you like having your blood pressure turned up to 11 and being compressed so much that you think your head might explode?** 

**Do you get off on enduring pain and suffering, and watching others endure it too?** 

**Do you have a deathwish every time you get under the bar?**

**Yes?**

#THEN WELCOME TO THE FORTNIGHTLY EQUIPPED LIFTING THREAD!!!","powerlifting, fitness"
"This was my first meet. I started lifting 2 years ago with the goal of just seeing how strong I could get if I just showed up to the gym every day and did the work. My goal for the meet was just to do the meet and if the weight was moving I was hoping to break a 1100 pounds. 

Squat - I opened at 363 lbs. I knew I could hit this on a bad day. I’m glad I chose it because I toon a narrow stance at the monolift, got nervous, and just took the squat super narrow. Still got 3 white lights. And that set my mood for the day. I hit 374 lbs with three white lights for my second attempt. I got a personal best of 402 lbs for my final attempt with three white lights. 

Bench - I was nervous about the commands so I had been training with a 2-3 second pause. The judge was much kinder to me. I got my first two attempts of 242 lbs and 259 lbs easily. Then I tried 275 lbs and got stuck a couple inches off the chest. 

Deadlift - Deadlift was going great in training. I got all three of my lifts here at 418 lbs, 440 lbs, and 451.

I came in dead last in my weight class lol. But I’m so fired up and excited about this sport. I know I have a lot more capacity and can’t wait to see where my training takes me this year.

"started 6/4/2021
finished 24/7/2021

start-m/15/87kg/182cm

end- m/16/91kg/186cm


i ran the program over 109 days instead of 84 due to having to take time off of lifting due to exams.

results (kg):

squat- 130kg->142.5kg

bench- 80kg->85kg

deadlift- 160kg->195kg

total- 370kg->422.5kg


the program has a deload week during the 7th week. overall i didnt suffer with recovery too much due to rpe being managed. i noticed i gained some size on my back (and my belly lol) likely due to higher frequency. 

in all honestly i skipped the abs bit at the end and for the most part did the accessories i wanted if they hit the same muscles or similar movement etc.

days 1-3 had me in the gym between 90-120 minutes depending on rpe and stuff which impacts rest time

day 4 which is a reverse sbd day can take around 3 hours. the squats atr the end are painful

i am surprised how much my deadlift has increased and will happily take it 

i didnt really track macros but just ate enough protein and tried (key word tried) to not eat too much junk food

i think ill try and slowy drop to 85kg and then see what to do from there. im probably gonna run his v3 program and then deadlift specialisation one after.

my main goal for this calander year is 1000lbs total as well as a 5 plate deadlift


overall i'd recommend this program to anyone who wants to increase their total a decent amount. I do think learning jamals technique helped a lot as its quite explosive off the floor.

Happy to field any questions","powerlifting, fitness"
"Last week a thread was posted that referenced the low level of sub activity these days but attempted to cast the blame directly at ""over-moderation"". Now while we strongly dispute the latter part, the former is definitely true. As pointed out in a post by u/WWalker17:

>So there's something objectively wrong being that a sub with 254,000 members is this dead. I checked the r/powerlifting analytics and here's some things I've noticed:

>1.We have about 254k members and are ranked at #1707 as of typing this.

>2.We average 0.000038 comments per member per day. We are ranked at #22,042 for this category

>3.We average under 200 comments per day, which is absurdly low for a sub of over 250k members.

>4.For the past two years we've had a steady decline of engagement, even though our membership has been rapidly increasing in the same timespan.

>5.We also keep falling further and further in our sub's ranking for engagement too.

Now, as far as the accusations of ""over-moderation"" go. The actual human moderators honestly do not remove a great deal of content unless it explicitly goes against the rules. This might include:

* Non-powerlifting related content, eg. posts about or videos of strongman competitors or bodybuilders who do not also take part in powerlifting.

* Beginner, generic and low-effort questions that are repeatedly asked, can probably be answered with a google search, and belong in the Daily or Weekly threads and would otherwise make us look like r/gainitforpowerlifting if we left them all up.

* Repeated discussion on controversial topics that have been discussed to death before and only end up causing huge fights.

* Self-promotion for the purpose of monetary gain, spam, survey requests, kickstarters, etc.

Otherwise the automod takes care of the majority of the work, and we are very thankful for that because it used to be a hell of a mission.

Now as far as reasons for the drop in sub engagement, we believe the major factors might be:

* Covid19 -  A significant portion of the lifting population is still dealing with pandemic regulations or lockdowns in some way so that kills any meet activity and even training for a lot of people. There is literally nothing we can do about this but wait.

* The flair system - while an integral part of our moderation system because it significantly reduces the number of bots, spammers, trolls and low effort posts that we have to deal with, it's possible that it has affected engagement from people who are too lazy, tech-literate or dumb to give themselves user flair so they can take part in the community. The introduction of the flair system did coincide with the beginning of the engagement drop-off 2 years ago. To try and counteract this we will make sure the notifications that new users get about flair are very clear and try to make it as easy as possible, but beyond that there is not much else we can do.

* Mistaken beliefs on what content is and isn't allowed on the main page - people honestly seem to think our rules are a lot stricter than they really are and this might have put them off posting.

* Lack of content creation/sharing from regular users - this is definitely a big one for the low amount of daily posts on the main page. You can't all just expect everyone else to do all the work of creating discussion for you, otherwise nothing gets posted. If you want to see change in the sub then some of you need to step up and be that change.

Now going forward, some people have suggested that we create some new recurring threads including a social media thread which we are definitely considering, and also regular mega-threads on specific topics which is something that I have tried to institute before but they ran out of steam.

Things that we will not be considering is allowing a free-for-all with posting any questions, topics or memes, or getting rid of the flair system.

So if you have any other concerns, questions or ideas about how we can improve sub-engagement please let us know.

**Please take special care to familiarise yourself with the [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/wiki/rules) before posting, especially [Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.235).**","powerlifting, fitness"
"While I already posted about my meet, I thought it would be good to post a review of Calgary Barbell's program, which I used to peak for it, because I haven't seen a lot of them in the search bar.

**TLDR:** Added 95 lbs to my previous gym total in competition: 31 to squat, 8 to bench, 54 to deadlift while on a cut. Gained a ton of confidence in my competition pause bench even though I only added 8 lbs to it. Squat and deadlift progressed well but may have gotten even stronger than my meet day numbers tell.

**Description and Context:** 23M college student who has been strength training on and off for years, consistently since last July, for powerlifting since last fall. Programs I've run were a bi-weekly linear periodization program and Johnnie Candito's 6 week program before this one. I used Calgary Barbell's 8 week program to peak for my first competition, which I've also posted about [here and includes my lift videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/ma9zb7/meet_report_first_meet_usapl_iron_city_open_23m/). One thing I would guess is somewhat noteworthy regarding context is that this program was the first experience I had with RPE/autoregulation. I wanted to compete at 83 kg and I ballooned up to 193 lbs when I ran Candito over the holidays, so I ran this on a cut over the ten weeks it took.

**Beginning Maxes and Results:**

&#x200B;

||Before|After|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squat|165.5 kg/365 lbs|180 kg/396 lbs|
|Bench|108 kg/240 lbs (Touch and Go)|112.5 kg/248 lbs (Comp Pause)|
|Deadlift|170 kg/375 lbs (Conventional)|195 kg/429 lbs (Sumo)|
|Body Weight|87 kg/193 lbs|81.4 kg/ 179 lbs|

**Alterations:**

No huge changes. The timeline didn't match up perfectly with the competition date, so I repeated the third week. I also substituted SLDL with RDL and threw in some curls at the end of the first and fourth day each week. Not necessarily a change in the program itself but I also made the switch from conventional to sumo as my competition deadlift during this program. Not positive how much my progress was attributable to the switch, but probably important to point out. At some point in the program (I think the second block), I got some mild hip pain from my competition deadlifts, so I pulled my top sets sumo then backoff sets conventional.

**Training Review:**

The eight week iteration of this program is broken up into two four-week blocks: a largely percentage based block then an autoregulated one. The program was a four-day-a-week split throughout. Both blocks had bench press or a close variation each workout. In both blocks you'd do one of Competition Pause Bench, 2 Count Pause Bench, Feet Up Bench (I took this to mean Larsen Press), and Touch and Go Bench at least in a day.

**Block 1:**

Despite being the earlier block of the program, there's actually not a ton of volume in this block, which I loved considering that I generally prefer lower rep ranges. Upper body accessories (on top of the mainstays of Comp pause, 2 count pause, Feet up, and TnG) were close grip incline, lat pulldowns, barbell rows (Pendlay for me), and dumbbell rows. Lower body accessories were pause squats and RDL, plus there were side planks. Overall, this block was pretty easy for the most part, though it was abundantly clear how much I'd neglected core work when I tried out the side planks. It did give some RPE work on some accessories, which I felt was helpful for someone like me who was new to it.

**Block 2:**

Block 2 ramps up the intensity with top triples and doubles (first two weeks), and singles (last two weeks) at 8 RPE ( 9 sometimes for bench) for competition lifts, backing off to sets based on your expected 1RM from those aforementioned top sets. I think I may have been overestimating my RPEs or maybe just getting used to it, but both my actual lifts and their E1RM's were pretty low the first couple of weeks, then much improved in the last two when hitting singles. Overhead press, high bar squat, close grip bench, and pin squats replaced the incline, RDL, and rows for accessories. The accessories were RPE based, either an 8RPE with ""repeat"" sets denoted with R (meaning repeat the same weight) or a 9RPE with ""fatigue sets"" denoted with F (meaning take 5% off). Highlights of this block included hitting the old squat max for an 8 RPE single as well as doubling 5 lbs above my previous bench max on close grip bench, inspiring me to narrow my competition grip a bit.

**Taper:**

There's also a taper week in which you work up to openers for each lift the first couple days then just do low volume at pretty submaximal weights the rest. Only reason I dedicated a section to it was because for some reason, after feeling great before that week, the openers I worked up to were lower than expected and felt worse, which I thought was noteworthy. Maybe accumulated fatigue, maybe just my perceptions of my exertion being off. The actual meet day result was pretty good.

**Final thoughts and impressions:** This program made my bench feel great, if not blow up. I went from an RPE 11 grinder at 240 that I trampolined off my chest to a pretty smooth competition paused 248. I'm guessing it was mostly attributable to competition pause being my main lift, but I also doubt the 4 days/week frequency hurt. That's not to say that this program didn't work well for the other two lifts as well. My final squat attempt on comp day was excessively deep and felt like there was much more left in the tank.  Deadlift went from being only 10 lbs heavier than my squat to 30, and I think I'm still figuring out my best sumo technique. I will say that there is a relatively high amount of backoff volume for deadlifts in the second block (think 6x5 after working up to top triple/double). For me, this required some adjustment by switching to conventional for that high volume to get rid of hip pain that arose.

I will say that my actual progress may have been even better, because I might have overestimated the RPE on some weight as I was going through the program. Come meet day, everything moved so quickly I can't help but think that it's been so long since I've trained anywhere close to failure that maybe my perception of ""I could've done two more reps"" is in reality ""I could've done three more reps"".

Overall, I'd highly recommend the program. Comparing it to my previous experience with Candito, it still gave me pretty good squat improvement while helping my deadlift and bench a lot more. I think the biggest improvement I saw from it was with bench, but this program is by no means limited to helping for one lift. I would imagine the 16 week is similarly effective, but if you only have 8 weeks to prepare for a meet, this one will certainly do.","powerlifting, fitness"
"As discussed earlier in previous threads, we were keen on the idea of promoting more discussion and engagement in the sub by introducing more regular scheduled threads and also large mega-threads on different topics related to powerlifting. 

The scheduled threads need to be based around things that are regularly discussed in relation to powerlifting but don't really warrant their own threads on the main page. A dedicated social media thread and a dieting thread might be two good topics but we are open to other suggestions so fire away with suggestions.

The mega-threads will probably be something similar to r/weightroom's regular discussion threads and we'll need to create a list of topics to cycle through and we're thinking they can happen either fortnightly or monthly so they don't end up ghost towns when people get bored of them repeating. They will encompass topics such as the 3 competition lifts, specific programs, equipment, beginner programs, off-season training, etc, but if you have any ideas for other topic areas please post them here.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Hey y'all. Been awhile since I've posted here. Last meet report I wrote was for 2019 USPA Nationals, where I competed as a junior in classic raw and totalled 1581lbs/717.5kg. Almost immediately after that meet I moved to Japan and might as well have not touched a barbell for a year. I came off all ""supplements"" and got kinda fat and bad at lifting. At the beginning of COVID I returned home and made Steve Gentili's Indy City Barbell my home in Indianapolis, Indiana. My coach and I decided to take a long break from wraps and switch to Raw lifting.


After about a year of just trying to suck less, I competed at a USPA meet in Kentucky. The meet was poorly hosted and my fiance became the community's villain of the week for making sure I got to warm up on the one deadlift bar at the meet. I wasn't happy with that meet so I never posted anything, but I totalled 672.5.


Flash forward exactly 5 months forward to this meet. My training had went very well. Zero missed lifts for 5 months. Better diet. Better sleep. Actually did back downs and even occasionally did accessories. Maxes this prep were a 580 squat, 380 bench, and a 556 deadlift. Had a very easy weight cut. Started at 191 a week out, weighed in at 176 without a second in a sauna. Awesome. 


DISCLAIMER: I do not put in my own attempts or even ask what I'm about to do. To my knowledge, these were my planned attempts but the second attempts may be off by a few kilos. 
Here's a link to [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUinfkFvrIn/?utm_medium=copy_link) for my thirds for verification. 

[SQUATS]
Squats are my bread and butter. I'm good at them. Felt pretty tired doing my last warmup but a friend told me that spitting aggressively would fire my CNS. She was right. Pro-tip, spit real hard into an empty bottle before you step on the platform. 

(1) 245kg/540lbs: Real easy. 

(2) 260kg/573lbs: Real easy. Got a single red light for depth but wasn't too concerned. I hit depth. 

(3) 272.5kg/600lbs: I did not plan to squat 600 this meet. I did not think I could squat 600. My handler (read: fiancé) put in 600 for me. I squatted 600. Was pretty excited. 12.5kg All-time Sleeve PR. 


[BENCH]
I'm a very technical bencher. Got extremely long commands on my first and second so we went conservative on my third. Got good commands on my third. 

(1) 157.5kg/348lbs: Real easy. 

(2) 165kg/363lbs: Real easy. 

(3) 170kg/374lbs: Also real easy. Could have pry benched closer to 400 with commands like that all day. Fine with it though. I have never had a 9/9 day before and usually the third bench is where I blow it so I was just happy to hit this one. I think this is a 7.5kg Meet PR. 


[DEADLIFTS]
I'm bad at deadlifts. I have little T-rex arms. Before I moved to Japan I had pulled 615 in the gym and 600 in a meet. Since returning my best pull was 556.

(1) 235kg/518lbs: opened light. Real easy. 

(2) 250kg/551lbs: moved to 551 to tie what I did at my last meet. Moved fine but slow. Calves cramped a bit on this one so I stretched them out and pounded a Gatorade between attempts. 

(3) 262.5kg/578lbs: Handler originally called 257.5 to put me over 700kg and chip my deadlift max; however, the record for the 82.5kg total on the board at Indy City Barbell is 702.5 and I'm an idiot and told my fiance ""put in whatever gives me 705."" It was slow but it moved. 12.5kg post-moving-to-Japan PR. I proceeded to bawl my eyes out on the platform after this.


[CONCLUSION]
First ever 9/9 day. 32.5kg meet PR in 5 months. Broke the 600lb squat barrier and the 700kg total barrier. Named best raw lifter of the meet and was narrowly beaten by a wrapped lifter for a 750 dollar cash prize. Going to take a week to reevaluate and then hop right back on the horse. Unsure of what my next meet will be. If you have suggestions let me hear them.","powerlifting, fitness"

"**Background**

I started lifting casually around 2010 and switched to focusing more on powerlifting in 2015. This was  my third meet - in my first meet I totaled 350 kg, in my second meet I got cocky and bombed out on squats, and my third meet was canceled due to COVID. I hadn't competed since 2018 and in that time I moved to a new city, started working with a local coach, and took several months off from lifting due to COVID-related gym closures. This past spring I was really frustrated, having made minimal progress since 2018, and I was starting to feel like maybe my strength had just peaked. I switched to working with an online coach and  a month out from this meet finally hit some gym PRs at a mock meet my gym held to raise money for local organizations. Then two weeks out I strained my back doing paused deadlifts and skipped out on all of my peak week lifts. One week out I failed a 140 kg deadlift (20+ kg below my max). I considered dropping out of the meet but decided to just lower my expectations and put up a total. 

**Squat**

1st attempt - 115 kg/253 lbs - good lift. I bombed out of my last meet on squats for depth so I was super nervous for this, but it moved like an opener should and got 3 whites. 

2nd attempt - 122.5 kg/270 lbs - good lift. This moved fine, again 3 whites. 

3rd attempt - 130 kg/286 lbs - good lift. Decided to go for matching my gym PR and made it! I was thrilled to hit this in a meet and to make it through squats without receiving any reds. 

**Bench**

1st attempt - 70 kg/154 lbs - good lift. I should have asked for a liftoff, and the rack setting was a little high, but this moved fine.

2nd attempt - 75 kg/165 lbs - good lift. Got a liftoff this time and it helped.

3rd attempt - 80 kg/176 lbs - good lift. I'd only hit this touch-and-go before, so I was really happy to hit it here. 

**Deadlift**

1st attempt - 142.5 kg/314 lbs - good lift. I was nervous for this after failing 140 earlier in the week, but warmups moved well and so did this. 

2nd attempt - 155 kg/341 lbs - good lift. Again, pretty nervous, but this moved fine and was pain free. 

3rd attempt - 165 kg/363 lbs - good lift. Decided to go for matching my gym PR. Lost some tightness in my lats but completed the lift. 

Total: 375 kg at 60 kg, went 9/9, matched all my gym PRs.

[Videos of best lifts](https://imgur.com/a/aBNbcAl)

**Summary**

I'm pretty pleased with how this meet turned out! Adding 25 kg to my total in 3 years isn't great progress, but it's something. All I can do is keep showing up in the gym and putting in the work. This meet was a good confidence boost and a good reminder of how supportive the powerlifting community is/how fun meets are.  I'm ready to keep building - I'd really like to squat 300+ lbs in a meet in 2022!

Thank you to Dungeon Fitness for putting on a great meet!","powerlifting, fitness"
"I will keep this short because this is my first Meet Report, and I didn't take notes during the event. 

My 12 yo daughter has been training with a coach for about 6 months. 
  
She had her first powerlifting meet last weekend.
 
She had 9 perfect lifts, set PA state records in all 3 lifts (record was previously vacant), and she won a gold medal (no other competitors in her division). 
 
She also met a bunch of other lady lifters, all who treated her so well. 
 
Was a very positive event for her and she is already asking to do another. 
 
I did not record all of her lifts, but her maxes were:
 
Squat: 195 lbs
 
Bench: 110 lbs
 
DL: 215 lbs

"**Background**

This was my fourth full meet; I’ve taken a pandemic-related competing break for almost exactly 2 years.

I've been lifting off and on for about 11 years, but didn't get very serious in terms of programming, mentality, and actually eating enough until about 4 years ago when I joined a powerlifting gym and eventually got a coach about 2.5 years ago. I'm vegetarian so prior to tracking my macros, I probably got under 60g of protein per day. I aim for 100-130g of protein now, get better sleep, and feel a lot better generally.

**Programming**

From March 2020 to May 2021, I lifted in my basement (without a bench or rack for a couple of months because everywhere was sold out), with a cheap bar and plates. Didn’t even have two sets of 45s but I was able to wedding cake–plate to get most of the weights I needed. Accessories were a little harder to do with just one set of 25# DBs and a 55#KB plus a couple of bands, but I made do until I got my jibby-jabby and went back to the gym.

My coach has me training 4 days a week:

Monday: comp squats + accessories

Tuesday: alt. bench & alt. deadlifts + accessories

Thursday: comp bench & alt. squats + accessories

Friday: deadlifts & comp bench (volume) + accessories

I took a vacation in the beginning of September, and not squatting for a little over a week apparently made me forget how to squat for about a solid month. It was getting back to normal the last 2 weeks before the meet but something is still not quite right.

I lifted all the way up to 3 days before the meet—Monday with a squat up to my 2nd attempt, and Wednesday comp deadlifts & bench up to my 2nd attempt. Not 100% sure why my coach had me lift so heavy the week of the meet but it \~mostly\~ turned out ok.

**Meet Day**

I traveled to KC (about 4 hours) the afternoon before the meet to weigh in. I did not cut at all for this meet, mostly because I didn’t want the added stress and because trying to keep my weight below the limit for evening weigh-ins during a drive would have been cutting it close (or I would have had to get up way early to make it for morning weigh-ins). I weighed in at 69.something kg (nice!) or about 153 lbs for the 75kg class.

Also my goal for this meet was to have fun and help my friend with their first powerlifting meet (especially since they were dealing with a lot of work/personal/medical stress leading up to the meet and didn’t have a chance to even practice cues or train much in the weeks prior to the meet). I think they had a good time, went 8/9, and hopefully has been bitten by the competition bug so we can compete together again!

[Link to vids](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVi8Y8ErJI1/)

**Squats**

297.6lbs (135kg) – This was my missed 3rd attempt in my last meet, so it was cool to start here. Felt a little heavy, which I’m mostly chalking up to lifting at 9 in the morning vs. 4 in the afternoon, but moved relatively smoothly.

314.2lbs (142.5kg) – 16lb. meet PR - Stalled a couple of times on the way up but made it eventually. A little frustrating since I’ve done this weight relatively easily a few times. Did the heavy squat on Monday mess me up? Was it just because of lifting earlier than usual? Was it because squats are still feeling a little off since my vacation? Who knows.

319.7lbs (145kg) – MISSED – Maybe wasn’t super confident going into this because of how heavy 314 felt. It stalled on the way up and didn’t feel like it was going to budge, so I shook my head and the spotters rescued me.

**Bench**

Oh bench, my enemy.

137.8 lbs (62.5kg) - Very easy, moved like a warmup

148.8 lbs (67.5 kg) – Slowed just a tad. I watched the video and decided to be a little conservative and only go to 70 instead of 72.5 (which I really wanted this meet). 

154 lbs (70 kg) – Not much slower than 67.5. Failed this at one of my earlier meets (and bench suffered during my last meet and I only got \~138) so it was good to get this. Watching the video, I maybe could have made the jump to 72.5 but it’s hard to say. Basically matches my gym best of 155#. (One red light from a side judge for my butt coming up slightly).

**Deadlifts**

314 lbs (142.5 kg) – Kept this one conservative because at my last meet, I was wiped by deadlifts and had very little left. But I shouldn’t have worried and should have started heavier because this was easy-peasy

336 lbs (152.5 kg) – Also very easy, and now I wish I would have gone to 347 and at least had that as a second attempt. Matches my best meet DL but 24lb under my gym best.

363.8 lbs (162.5 kg) – MISSED – I decided to send it on this lift and go for a small (\~4 lb) PR. Alas, either I was too confident or the fact that I took a larger jump than usual between the 2nd and 3rd attempts due to the low 1st attempt, and the bar was glued to the floor.

**Results:**

7/9

365 kg total (804.7 lb), a 55lb. total PR

2nd (out of 2) for Women’s 75kg—I feel like there are usually more women in this class but

Results haven’t been posted so not sure where I was via DOTS or whatever, or where I would have placed in the 67.5kg class if I’d cut (and assuming I didn’t lose any strength).

**What's Next**

Trying to decide what I’d like to do going forward programming/coach-wise, but I want to focus on getting my squat feeling strong again, getting heavy deads to show up consistently, and maybe get my bench up from poverty levels. This week I’m resting extra, playing around with random stuff in the gym, and dealing with getting ready to have our bathroom renovated (so many things to pick out!!). Meets and meet prep always leave me feeling pretty physically and mentally drained (I left my lunch on the stove for 3 hours yesterday after forgetting about it), so I probably won’t compete again until next spring, depending on what meets are available. The IPL DT NA Championships are going to be in my city next fall, so I’m shooting for that since I now have a qualifying Master total (need a Class II or above).","powerlifting, fitness"
"Hello!

***Summary***

I had a wonderful first meet experience representing my country of El Salvador. I'm so thankful for the opportunity.

I kinda had a 4 week prep - I found out I was doing the meet last minute and I had a major exam exactly the same day I found out (I had two week hiatus due to cramming/working full time). I was running the CBB16-2 app programming.

My goal for the meet honestly was to get my openers as I made a promise to my friend who recently passed that was what I was going to do for my first meet ever. Get my openers and just wild out on my remaining attempts.

I PR'd on my second attempts and immediately beat them on my 3rd attempts. I surprised myself and my meet handler encouraged/believed I had peaked stronger than the initial 2 & 3 attempts we had written down. I realize I perform best under competition standards. I am a total goofball in the gym. I was very relaxed and my meet handler/friend was absolutely amazing - such a calming presence. I didn't have to think much at all.

I didn't even listen to music or whatever. Just sniffed my nose bleach ammonia for my squats and deadlifts and I was good. I really can't explain how relaxed I felt for the most part except when it was my turn to do my lifts on the platform. My handler thinks I am crazy I put my nose right under my freshly opened bottle of ammonia haha.

**My results were as follows:**

***Squat***

[125kg](https://youtu.be/Y7CSI7TPO0s) Had a bad walk-out from being nervous and also why wasn't the rack bolted down? I have an aggressive setup. Three whites.

[135kg](https://youtu.be/IbtwGUctZ58) **PR.** I second guessed my brace. I have the tendency to nod my head at maximal lifts wasn't for the spotters. Three whites.

[140kg](https://youtu.be/U4xZeVzAiU4) **PR.** Grinder of a squat. Nodded my head for myself not the spotters. One red for depth on the right, two whites.

***Bench***

[57.5kg](https://youtu.be/3NUuouN8hAo) This was a very conservative opener I get extremely nervous for bench and I misgrooved it so much during prep. *I kept getting my start command before my butt was down on the bench I was very confused.* One red, two whites. I just ignored the red I am getting my lifts.

[62.5kg](https://youtu.be/gWCLRrLx7u8) **PR.** *Butt in the air when I got my start command.* One red two whites. Meet handler said don't worry about it we couldn't figure out why I got the red and if I got it on the 3rd attempt I would ask why.

[65kg](https://youtu.be/-GkubnbMwCM) **PR.** I took a little bit extra time to set up for this one and forgot to grab the uprights as I normally do. Got my start command when my butt was actually down, so at the correct time. Three whites. Felt like I could have gone up to 67.5kg but 65kg was already a big reach for the day I thought 62.5kg was my max.

***Deadlifts***

[130kg](https://youtu.be/sRtpggy9AxI) Grip kept giving out all prep I am surprised this was fine tbh. I had no idea how easy this moved it felt terrible. Three whites.

[142.5kg](https://youtu.be/yi7ZzN7nkEQ) **PR.** Again just felt harder than it looked and grip was feeling iffy here. This was a huge jump I was planning on 135kg. This was me going screw it let's just load it up as my gym best is 140kg. Three whites.

[147.5kg](https://youtu.be/PmrRjM0hGZo) **PR.** This is the one I was actually disappointed in. I felt like I could have pushed it to 150-155kg. I think if I had gone up my grip would have failed. I partially ripped my callouses on my 3rd attempt. Three whites.

***Background***

I began powerlifting last year of June at 25yo. Before that I was pretty sedentary. I did dancing when I was a teenager and most I ever used was my siblings dumbbells to do ab exercises haha.

In 2018, I was exposed to lifting I did some crossfit/lifting combination but it no longer interested me.

In 2020, lockdown drove me crazy I felt like I needed an outlet as soon as gym's in FL opened up I decided I wanted to lift weights. I started off with a coach in my gym but that didn't work out. **A** ***huge understatement of how unprofessional that person was and how cooked with volume I was under their programming. I didn't know any better they told me my 8 hour SBD sessions were NORMAL for a beginner and it is normal to feel terrible and take ibuprofen before lifting sessions.***

I work in the operating room with long hours and thank goodness other lifters in my gym intervened because I wasn't sleeping well, spending too much time in the gym. I almost quit powerlifting thinking it wouldn't work out with my schedule. I felt like shit all the time, I started getting injured, plateaued etc.

So I branched out ran for a little bit Steve Denovi's 16 week program. The AMRAPs on that program gave me so much confidence I realized I was leaving so much in the tank and I was wasting so much time in the gym before. I learned so much from Steve's Youtube videos. I started to join Bryce's free CBB form checks super helpful and knowledgeable.

***Programming***

I ran the brand new CBB16-2 on the Calgary Barbell app and got my form checked by Bryce and other CBB coaches Danii and Derrick on the app. I had the help of other experienced lifters of my gym help me in person as well.

Studying for my job board exam **I skipped all my accessories** on the program to save time while I worked full time and studied so I have no idea how that would have affected me at all if I had actually done them. Lifting was very inconsistent as well had to skip a day or lift like 4 days back to back sometimes. Just made it work.

I enjoyed the frequency and programming. My form felt super smooth. The two week hiatus and extreme stress from studying and mourning for my friend had me really worried during my 4 week prep.

***Life factors***

I did lose 2-3kg in the first block of the program I was around 84-85kg, all I did was track my food and eat 2400 calories a day. After I lost that weight I just ate however I wanted and naturally remained around 79-81kg consistently. I no longer needed to track 2400 calories I had an idea of what I was eating every day. My body was happy eating that much, no more no less.

I sleep 4-5hours per night normally. Once my exam was over I managed to start sleeping more averaging around 6 and got 8 hours on really good days. Sleeping more definitely makes a difference but I didn't have the luxury until literally 4 weeks ago.

Stress is always high. Work is stressful. Crying a lot while mourning. My exam was peak stress so glad that was over.

Honestly I am just happy to be lifting I am sure once I get these factors under better control I'll do better in the future.


***Ending thoughts***

Can't wait for next year and no complaints I had a way better meet than I expected!

I've have some goals in mind for next year lose weight intentionally to improve my health and sleep more.

Get back to dancing figure out how I can incorporate that with my powerlifting schedule now that I am no longer sedentary I feel like I am missing out on that skill.

Might do some strongman stuff in the off season seems super fun.

*Maybe* I will get a coach in the future but we'll see I like my spontaneity and I feel like I am getting quality programming and form checks via the Calgary Barbell App. I am no where competitive enough to feel like I am a place to do that anyways and I kinda just want to do the same thing again for my next meet. Get my openers and go crazy on my other attempts. I feel like a coach would care more than me if I went 3/9 or something idk.","powerlifting, fitness"
"# Background

Hey y'all, I'm writing this up to share ~~wisdom~~ words with y'all about this program. I'm just your typical run-of -the-mill ex-high school football guy turned lifter. 5'10"", \~225 lbs, bench starting the program was around 315, squat 405, deadlift 445. I pull conventional, despite everything about my anthropometry saying otherwise, but I think conventional is better for training for me, and really hits my own weaknesses best. 

Unfortunately I didn't take any videos for y'all. I used [http://tsampa.org/training/scripts/coan\_phillipi\_deadlift/](http://tsampa.org/training/scripts/coan_phillipi_deadlift/) for my calculator/training log. I've tried this program once before but I was an idiot and altered my top sets because I thought working as hard as I could every week would be good for me (what a concept, right?). I did this workout on my first workout of the week, then hit a push day, legs, another back day (with no deadlifts/significant low back work), and another push day. I didn't use any other structured programs. During weeks 6 and 7 I front squatted 3 days a week because it was sorely underdeveloped. I missed 315x1 during week 7 and then stopped doing front squats.

# Week 1

**Deadlift (75%):** 1x2 @ 370 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (60%):** 8x3 @ 295 lbs (90 sec rest b/w sets)  
3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):  
  **Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps  
  **Bent over row**: 8 reps  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**: 8 reps  
  **Arched back good morning**: 8 reps

This week was easy. Towards the end of the workout, the lower back pump was very intense. I did all my reps, and I believe I used weights in this order: 195, 185, 45lb plate, and 135. Bent rows were too easy and good mornings were awful.

# Week 2

**Deadlift (80%):** 1x2 @ 395 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (65%):** 8x3 @ 320 lbs (90 sec rest b/w sets)  
3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):  
  **Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps  
  **Bent over row**: 8 reps  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**: 8 reps  
  **Arched back good morning**: 8 reps

This week was more of the same: insane, painful back pump, and pretty easy deadlifts. The last two sets of speed deads were a little difficult. I could feel some fatigue carrying over from the previous week, and I think this week I started yanking on the bar a little more than I would have liked to. I used these weights on the accessories: 195, 195, 45lb plate, 125lb on good mornings (I think I was using a 35 lb bar on this one).

# Week 3

**Deadlift (85%):** 1x2 @ 420 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (70%):** 6x3 @ 345 lbs (90-120 sec rest b/w sets)  
3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):  
  **Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps  
  **Bent over row**: 8 reps  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**: 8 reps  
  **Arched back good morning**: 8 reps

This was probably my favorite week. The fatigue was there, but at the end of this workout, I still felt strong and my back pump was fun, but not overdoing it. I used the same weights as the previous week.  


# Week 4

**Deadlift (90%):** 1x2 @ 445 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (75%):** 5x3 @ 370 lbs (90-120 sec rest b/w sets)  
3 circuits (rest 90sec between exercises, 2-3 minutes between circuits):  
  **Stiff-leg deadlift**: 8 reps  
  **Bent over row**: 8 reps  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**: 8 reps  
  **Arched back good morning**: 8 reps

This was the hardest week by far. 445x2 was intimidating and challenging. The speed deads were also very difficult and moved less like ""speed"" deads than I would have liked. I used the same weights again for the rotations, but bumped rows from 195 to 205. At this point, I started to feel a lot of strength on the accessories, but also a lot of fatigue. By the end, I couldn't hardly stand up straight because the pump was too intense. Man, hitting 445x2 was awesome though. 

# Week 5

**Deadlift (80%):** 3x3 @ 395 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (65%):** 3x3 @ 320 lbs (120 sec rest b/w sets)  
**Power shrugs (60% of current):** 3x5 @ 265 lbs  
**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 3x5  
**Bent over row**: 3x5  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**:3x5  
**Arched back good morning**: 3x5

I started stretching relatively prolifically after week 4's workout, which absolutely helped my recovery. I did 205, 215, 45+10lb plates, and 135 on accessories. My lats at this point looked incredible and were strong as hell. The deadlift part of the workout was pretty easy. Notably, my gym was closed due to weather the following week, so I had a week off after this workout. When the following Monday rolled around, my body was begging for some deadlifts and I was in a pretty bad mood because of it. 

# Week 6

**Deadlift (85%):** 1x2 @ 420 lbs (maybe?, I was working out in my apartment gym and there was a weird bar in there and some weights I didn't trust. I loaded up ""435"", but I think it was actually 425.)  
**Speed deadlift (70%):** 3x3 @ 345 lbs (120 sec rest b/w sets)  
**Power shrugs (65% of current):** 3x5 @ ~~290 lbs~~ 315 lbs.  
**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 3x5  
**Bent over row**: 3x5  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**:3x5  
**Arched back good morning**: 3x5

I was in a different gym for this workout. The deadlifts were pretty easy, again. I started doing the power shrugs with some heavier weight and began to include some other shrug work on other days of the week. My grip+lat+trap strength was really beginning to pick up and I felt very strong on my other upper body days.

# Week 7

**Deadlift (90%):** 1x2 @ 445 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (75%):** 3x3 @ 370 lbs (120 sec rest b/w sets)  
**Power shrugs (70% of current):** 2x5 @ 310 lbs  
**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 2x5  
**Bent over row**: 2x5  
  **Underhand** **~~(reverse) grip lat pulldown~~** **weighted pullup**2x5  
**Arched back good morning**: 2x5

445x2 was incredible. It moved easy and automatically. Easy enough that I think I could probably hit 445 every day of the week nowadays. Weeks 4 and 7 were very similar deadlift-wise, but jeez man I was feeling good. I did 45+25 lb plates for pullups.  


# Week 8

**Deadlift (95%):** 1x2 @ 470 lbs  
**Speed deadlift (70%):** 3x3 @ 345 lbs (120 sec rest b/w sets)  
**Power shrugs (75% of current):** 2x5 @ 335 lbs  
**Stiff-leg deadlift**: 2x5  
**Bent over row**: 2x5  
**Underhand (reverse) grip lat pulldown**: 2x5  
**Arched back good morning**: 2x5

470x2 was awesome. It was grindy, and I reached a level of effort that I was never able to apply on the deadlift. Back in my high school days and squatting frequently, my top sets looked something like 425x5. This single set recapitulated that feeling of strength and sheer application of force. I've never been more excited about lifting heavy on deads than right after this set. Unfortunately, my hubris got to me and I started messing around on my accessory work. Between doing sumo instead of conventional for speed deads and doing my stiff-leg deads differently, I tweaked my hip and this sort of plagued me for a week. Its gotten better now, but its something I'm going to have to be mindful of in the future. 

# Week 9

**~~Deadlift (97.5%):~~** ~~1x1 @ 485 lbs~~  
**~~Speed deadlift (70%):~~** ~~2x3 @ 345 lbs (rest as needed b/w sets)~~  
**~~Power shrugs (75% of current):~~** ~~2x5 @ 335 lbs~~  
**~~Stiff-leg deadlift~~**~~: 2x5~~  
Unfortunately, I had to alter the back end of this program, which just drives me crazy.  I thought about this workout for about 4 days straight. I had convinced myself I could get up 500 lbs even. My lifting partner showed up about 30 minutes late this day (not his fault), so I had about a 15 minute break between 475x1 and 500 for a max. I got it about 3 inches off the ground and maybe could have grinded it out, but my form would have been awful and I was frustrated. The prescribed 485x1 would have done me much better. Don't deviate from the program, I guess. I tried warming back up with my partner and pulled 475 again, but I knew I was done after then.

# Week 10

There's a week 10, but I didn't do it due to some traveling. I had the proper scheduling to include it, but there was some inclement weather. I really wish I could have done this program properly though. 

&#x200B;

# Conclusions+Takeaways

Stretch early and often. My hips+back felt much stronger after I started stretching everything out.

Pull with a purpose, and with solid form on the speed deadlifts. I can not stress this point enough. There is no point to doing the speed deadlifts unless you are doing them correctly. My form on the higher weight sets really broke down. I turn my right foot to the inside when I pull and tend to helicopter a bit when I pull mixed grip. 

Don't deviate from the program. I'm pretty confident 495 was there for me if I was able to follow the program correctly, but I'll take 475 easy. 445 was an estimated max anyways. +30 or +40 on my max in 10 weeks is progress that I will take. 

I wish this program made me better at pulling on my heavy sets, but that's either directly my fault for sloppy form on my speed deadlifts, or that's an unrealistic wish to have due to fatigue from pulling heavy too often. 

My bench improved, significantly. I'm not sure if this is due to all the lat work, or if there were newbie gains involved, but my bench improved from a \*maybe\* 315x1 to an easy, fast 345x1 (wouldn't count in competition, no pause involved). **Am I the only one who had this happen?**  

Up next I'm going to do smolov jr. for low-bar squat and then focus on some sumo deadlifts.","powerlifting, fitness"
"TLDR: Did my first meet yesterday, and went a lot better than I thought it would

Background: I’ve been “lifting weights” ever since I started high school, but only started doing actual compound barbell movements the summer before my junior year. I’m a senior now and graduating in a couple months so I wanted to do a meet for the luls before I went to college. 

Meet prep: 
Had no coach, basically just watched YouTube videos on form and got free programs online (Allan Thrall and Calgary Barbell r the GOATS). I ran Calgary barbells free 8 week program leading up to the meet. 

Meet day: 
Weigh in was at 7 and registration at 6:30 in the morning. Idk why but whenever I have to wake up super early I am unable to fall asleep. Yesterday was no different, and I went in with only two hours of sleep (yay). Passed weigh ins but I was cutting it a little close, I weighed in at 72.8kg. 

Squat:

Attempt 1: 142.5kg, so so easy, I did not anticipate it being this easy, because I hit this just Monday and it was fairly hard.

Attempt 2: 152.5kg, also extremely easy, no problems here 

Attempt 3: 165kg, this was also a lot easier than I thought, however, I got red lighted because I lost balance at the top and my feet shifted off the floor for a little bit. Very unfortunate.

Bench:

Attempt 1: 112.5kg. I have started to notice a trend at this point, because 125kg also flew up with no problems. I hit 125kg on Tuesday and it had also felt relatively hard. 

Attempt 2: 117.5kg. Was slightly harder, had to grind a bit, but it went up fairly well in my opinion. 

Attempt 3: 122.5kg. I really wanted to hit 125kg, but I was doubting myself and decided to go for the safe bet. I made an all time pr with attempt 2 anyway, so anything after that is just extra. This weight was definitely hard, but also very doable. As soon as I hit it, I knew I could have done 125kg. Should have never doubted myself. 

Deadlifts:

Attempt 1: 175kg Guess what? This one also flew up. Felt like nothing. 

Attempt 2: 190kg Pretty big jump, I had planned for 190kg to be my conservative third attempt, but seeing how everything just felt so so light, I thought why not. Very difficult, but I hit it nonetheless. 

Attempt 3: 200kg. Honestly, I had no idea if I could hit this or not. I did my planned third attempt for my second, and didn’t know what to do next, so I just picked a nice round number and went with it. This one was a huge grinder, watching the video back, it took like a whole 7-8 seconds from the time the bar left the floor until I got the down command. But I hit it nonetheless and I’m very proud of myself. 


Recap: considering I went in with 2 hours of sleep, I exceeded my expectations by a huge margin. I placed second in the teens category, which took me by huge surprise. I am attributing my meet success to large amounts of adrenaline, caffeine, and the really hype atmosphere at the meet. Like it was so fucking hype. I’m usually a really quiet person, but even I was screaming by the end of it, it was amazing. Really proud of my deadlift in particular. I even finally decided to make an Instagram account so I can share my meet success. Here’s the [link ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNyegV7FSuB/?igshid=1rugmew8sibwr) to all my successful attempts. Most definitely gonna compete again, although idk when. I’m still super young, so it can only go up from here!","powerlifting, fitness"

"EDIT:  the formatting is a bit off, sorry. I tried to fix it, and the markdown formatting *looks* right, but it keeps doing weird things -- at least when I view it. 

**Description and Context:**

I ran this from ~4/27/21 to 7/20/21. [This](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/bulgarian-manual/) link will take you to the download page on Stronger by Science.

*Bulgarian Manual* is the /u/gnuckols take on the Bulgarian Method. If you aren't familiar with the history, here's the basic idea:

Ivan Abadjiev created a dynasty of dominant Bulgarian weightlifters by placing specificity above all else. Lifters would pursue max lifts on a near-daily basis while training *as a job* -- that is, they spent an inordinate amount of time doing maximal weightlifting and most of the rest of their time recovering -- their job was to *win*... and they did ([this](https://youtu.be/Y-GgmRcyIc8) is a recent Weightlifting House interview with Stefan Botev that gives a picture of what that was like). Once the training approach became widely-known, others tried to adapt it to their circumstances; for powerlifting, obviously, maxing out all the time is as specific as one could imagine. In *Bulgarian Manual*, Nuckols details how he gradually figured out a way to train for powerlifting in a style that mimicked the Bulgarian method while accomodating circumstances such as ""avoiding injury"" (Abadjiev was nicknamed ""the Butcher"" for a reason) and ""not taking drugs"" (some former Bulgarian lifters suggested that they were on a whole *shitload* of dianabol, among other things). The short ebook, written in collaboration with Omar Isuf, offers a fairly simple plan for maxing as often as possible and how to train when maxing isn't necessarily on the table that day. 

**Results:**

For reference, all of my lifts are raw (knee sleeves for squats). 

I began this regime after 8 weeks of hypertrophy work based on the RP 6x/wk Hypertrophy template. In that time, the most load I did was 1x385lbs (low-bar, beltless) for the squat and 1x265lbs (competition-style, pause) for bench, both as overwarm singles.

During the program, I went from 430lbs (1RM tested, low-bar, belt) to 475lbs (RPE 9.5ish) and from 290lbs to 305lbs (RPE 9ish) on squat and bench respectively. The RPE estimates here are probably the most accurate I have ever made due to the nature of the program (see below under structure). 
 
**Alterations:** 

None save that I did not perform the prescribed deadlift singles consistently. This was probably detrimental, but I imagine that it won't matter that much as I proceed in my training simply due to the strength gains in similar muscles/movements.
 

**Discussion:** 

The program yielded good results for essentially boiling down to ""max, or do backoffs"" as often as possible. I generally felt good, did not face any injuries or spillover issues, and enjoyed the work throughout most of the duration. I learned very quickly that I could ""own"" weights that were previously intimidating, and that I could do so without leaning on aids like ergogenic doses of caffeine or motivating music. PRs notwithstanding, I think the sheer confidence under load may have been the most valuable part of the experience -- even having moved on to starting a more general strength program, I feel as though even heavy loads are much more bearable: it's just weight, I can lift it, and so I shall.

**Structure:** 

As many days per week as possible, work up to a daily minimum that is at least 85% of your known 1RM. As your daily minimum becomes easier, increase it (I strongly recommend reading the ebook linked above).  If the minimum feels good and does not engender technique issues, proceed to lift as heavy as possible until form breaks down. If the minimum feels bad, drop back (see the ebook) and perform sets of 1-3. If a weight above the minimum feels good (as above) for several (4-5) days in a row, that may become the new minimum. Maxes occur when the daily minimum is subjectively easy.

**Volume/Frequency/Loading/Intensity:** 

Volume is relatively low per-session, but frequency is maximized. This results in volume similar to more typical training, but distributes that volume over more sessions and thus improves the work:benefit ratio. Loading/Intensity is *high*; you will be working with maximal weights quite often.
 
** Periodisation/Progression:** 

Progression is based on the daily minimum. As the current daily minimum becomes relatively trivial and a weight above it becomes consistently achievable without arousal/form breakdown, the higher weight eventually becomes the minimum.
 
**Specificity:** 

As high as possible -- the whole program is built on doing near-maximal or maximal work as often as is reasonable based on autoregulation. Since powerlifters compete on maxes, the carryover is obvious. Note that this is *not* a peaking program -- it will not produce the sudden jump after tapering as you are taking a longer-term approach to maximal loads, which renders mechanisms like supercompensation less effective.
 
* **Auto-regulation:** 

See above in structure.
 
**Fatigue Management:** 

By using relatively low volume per-session and basing intensity on autoregulation, this approach ideally accrues little fatigue on any given day. In practice, this will probably result in fast, steady gains for the first 3-6 weeks and then a natural, slower undulation of progress further in.
 
**Customization:**

Customization lies mainly in accessory choice. Due to the high-intensity, high-frequency structure of the program, conventional accessories may not be necessary or useful (e.g. I did not find extra triceps/biceps work particularly helpful while adjusting those according to how I felt).
 
**Pros:**

You should quickly build confidence under heavy weights, and PRs will come at a rapid-fire pace -- at least at first -- despite essentially beating the same movements to death. The ability to simply unrack and move 90%1RM or higher weights is psychologically quite handy. One of the most interesting aspects of this approach is being able to experience strength gains explicitly and immediately -- you will likely gain a better sense of what you can and cannot *actually* do in a much shorter time than on typical programming.
 
**Cons:**

Although this approach is very enticing at first due to rapid progress, the act of ""gym -> squat -> bench -> maybe accessories"" eventually becomes a bit stale.

It is also *very* easy to regress to the novitiate approach of ""maxing to get new maxes"" rather than maxing when it is actually appropriate. That is, if you are susceptible to PR-chasing, you might end  up doing counterproductive things when the fast gains finally slow down.
 
**Recommendations:**

Nuckols recommends that a lifter have at least a few years' experience (i.e. a solid intermediate) before trying this sort of approach; anecdotally, the body awareness and ability to commit to backing off when appropriate are deeply important, and more likely the ken of lifters who have a decent bit of meaningful training under their belts. I cannot disagree with this.
 
**Conclusion:** 

This is a very interesting way to approach strength. It is especially fun at first and then quickly demands discipline and dedication; if you can remain realistic in terms of your numbers, this is a very powerful tool for approaching peak strength.

"Squat 187.5kg/413lb  
Bench 112.5kg/248lb  
DL 215kg/474lb

Was pleased to match my meet best squat after being quite sick last Saturday, and not being able to stand up with 403lbs Monday without down and up movement.  
Probably had 190kg in me today.  
7.5kg Meet PR on bench  
12.5kg Meet PR on DL  
So 20kg meet best total PR

I am now officially in the books with 515kg total  
First time into the 1,100s with 1,135  
\#14 all years USAPL Masters 3A 93kg raw  
535kg total will get me top 10.

Squat is technically a new state record, because first meet as an M3, so i displaced the guy who is 9 years older, but who still benches more than me.  
He had surpassed my DL by 2.5 kilos with 205 early in 2020, so i took that state record back, and took back the total record back by 15 kilos.  
(Masters records stand in the younger masters classes unless someone has done better than the older lifter)

8 for 9 because i changed my 3rd DL attempt from 220, to 227.5.  
I was tired as hell, from travel, bad sleep in the motel room, and just a full day.  
Maybe at home on a deadlift only day i would have had it.

It was really cool seeing all those red plates though.  
Did get it off the ground.

Next time, red plates, next time.

Popped my cherry on missing a lift in a meet.

I only mildly regret it, and kind of not.My base goal was met on my 2nd DL, and i think it was a really good meet for me.

Doing another in early November.","powerlifting, fitness"
"I recently came to the conclusion that I am finished with the sport of powerlifting.

Nothing really happened, I'm generally injury free (aside from the general wear and tear issues we all face) and relative to how strong I've been I'm not far off on a day to day basis... still train 3-5 times a week, no health issues, I just don't feel like competing adds anything to my life anymore where honestly it used to be the focal point of my life despite being a really average lifter!

Realistically I think I could continue to improve my comp lifts for the next few years at least if I had to but knowing what would go into that process feels like a huge drain now VS a fun challenge.

I used to be consumed with training, would get a huge buzz out of the heavy sessions, and a massive sense of achievement from testing myself on the platform none of those things really do it for me anymore and I'm not sure if that makes me feel really sad, or if I'm lucky that I lost interest in the sport before it ground me into dust.

If the me of 20 years ago heard me saying all this he'd have called bullsh!t ... I'll be a lifter til I die, this is my life etc. and would probably call the me of today a loser/quitter. And the me of today is honestly (and maybe unfortunately) totally ok with that.

So, what about you guys - why did you stop? Did you choose to stop or did something happen? Any regrets or unfinished business looking back on your lifting?","powerlifting, fitness"
"**TLDR: Went 8/9 with a 557.5Kg/1229lb total in my first meet since October 2019 with PRs on my Squat, Deadlift, and Total.**

[Video of my best made attempts here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXHy3PFN6AZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

**Background**

[Write-up from my last meet in May October 2019.](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/dhuxyy/meet_report_rps_powermania_louisville_ky_m27_raw/)

This was my 5th meet overall but first in over 2 year. I'll try to keep the background brief:

* After my last meet, I essentially stopped squatting and deadlifting (aside from light RDLs) for a couple months to let whatever glute strain I had actually heal. I slowly starting working them back in to training in early 2020 just in time for everything to close down!
* I didn't have a home gym during lockdown, so I tried to make-do with bodyweight movements and band stuff; but I didn't really stick with it. I did have a 16kg kettlebell, so I chose to complete Dan John's 10,000 swing challenge. 16kg may have been a little light, but I made it work (I think this challenge actually helped improve my hinge ability despite being away from a barbell for a few months).
* I also took the opportunity to go on a cut during this time. From April to early July 2020, I dropped from 178lb to 155lb. Since then, I've been slowly bulking back up.
* In May 2020, I started running thanks to seeing /u/dadliftsnruns post about his training to get to a sub 5-minute mile and a 6 plate deadlift. Before this, I had never actually run a mile continuously, and now I'm pretty consistently getting 20 miles per week (weather permitting). My biggest accomplishment here is running a half marathon in ~2:07:25 in March 2021 (not like an official one; just 13.1 miles around my neighborhood).
* Gyms opened back up in June 2020, and I started with a brief 3-week cycle of 5/3/1 BBB to get re-acquainted with the main lifts before jumping into to Greg Nuckols Stronger by Science Hypertrophy program. I ran two full 21 week cycles of that and then switched to the ""Reps to Failure"" version of the SBS strength program. I essentially ran 1.5 cycles of that into this meet (one full 21 week cycle followed by 12 weeks of a second cycle).
* Turns out having good cardio helps with your conditioning! Also, I think I could literally run either the hypertrophy or RTF templates of the SBS program indefinitely because I enjoy the training style so much! I highly recommend them.
* I also bought a house and got engaged during this time, both of which are pretty cool things I think.

**Meet Prep**

I decided to train like normal going into the meet rather than trying to peak for it. Since it had been so long since my last meet, my main goal was to just get back on the platform and hit some PRs that I knew I was capable of. I wanted to pull 500lb+ in a meet since I had come so close to doing so before. Back in August, I pulled 500lb conventional, so I was very confident in this goal because my sumo is stronger and all of my training indicated I should be capable of at least ~525lb. For squat, my most recent PR was 197.5kg in August, so naturally my goal was to get this to 200kg, which also seemed doable. Going into the meet, I signed up for the 82.5kg class and weighed in at 76.0kg. While I easily could've gone down a class, I knew going in that I wasn't winning either class or breaking a record in either; so I just left myself room to not stress about anything.

**Meet Day**

This meet was at Everyday Athletes in Louisville, KY, which is the gym I go to. Apparently, this was the largest powerlifting meet in Kentucky history since there was like 130 lifters or so. At least 30 - 40 of us were EA members; so it made for an amazing atmosphere. The gym owner even bought all of us shirts to wear for it for free! There were two platforms (Blue and Red), and each platform had four flights of lifters. For the day, I would be in the fourth flight on the blue platform along with around 5 other EA members, which made warmups easy.

**Squats**

My last four meets were either in 100% Raw or RPS, so this was my first time actually getting to wear sleeves for competition!

* [1st Attempt: 180 kg / 397 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMMqu4Ow7VULszqZ_-ZV4S5rxUrr-kDE/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Took a little while to get the start command. According to the head judge, something was up with the gear on the lifter before me? Luckily it didn't make the lift hard, and he said he'd make sure to give a quicker start command on the next attempts.

* [2nd Attempt: 190 Kg / 419 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHALra4FIf_wLhuyZQyRkJmRf59WaNXv/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Got a faster start command this time! Felt the same as the opener, just slightly slower.

* [3rd Attempt: 200 kg / 441 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEwESDhTr1OOhdRf1xzr3-McXCsSxxFc/view?usp=sharing) - Good. A 7.5 kg meet PR, and a 2.5kg personal PR. Felt just like the other attempts, just slower. I felt completely confident going into this since I was able to stay out of my own head!

**Bench**

So, everyone in our flight finished warmups and was ready to go when we were told the judges would go on a 5 minute break after flight C. They only had a handful of lifters to go, so that didn't seem like a big deal. However, the break went on for what felt like 20 minutes, so we were getting pretty antsy to start. I'm not sure how, but I wish they could have communicated this a little better so we could've adjusted our warmups.

* [1st Attempt: 115 kg / 254 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3ppYoppMc2sViceakRzc56diiD8rozW/view?usp=sharing) - Good. If the unexpected break wasn't enough, it felt like we were getting a long pause command.

* [2nd Attempt: 120 Kg / 264 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0zTpDyCfNCuOzhEXETFYL6ViVKAgKYw/view?usp=sharing) - Good. I got on red light from a side judge. I assume it was from lifting my butt up since it sounded like they were being pretty strict with that according to other lifters. Still got two whites though.

* [3rd Attempt: 125 kg / 275 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1naA4gDXQFvvg1t-QIfdN1bV21gCWFWZT/view?usp=sharing) - Miss. Didn't feel too bad on the way down, but I just hit a brick wall on the way up. I don't remember shaking like I did on the video either. Probably should've taken a smaller jump, but I'm not confident 122.5kg would've been there either. Bench is definitely a weak point that I need to badly address going forward!

**Deadlift**

This is what I came here for!

* [1st Attempt: 215 kg / 474 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1na0Nj3AEnogsHI4jJuCBL0w-Y9oVhHWy/view?usp=sharing) - Good.

* [2nd Attempt: 227.5 kg / 501 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_RzB_qq4B2yrcoe5Aw51SF1rNuXZGCj/view?usp=sharing) - Good. Goal accomplished and a 7.5kg meet PR! 

* [3rd Attempt: 237.5 kg / 524 lb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXQ5UK3Yg7KvlTOrrpOcxC13yUZQIk5N/view?usp=sharing) - Good. 17.5kg meet PR and a 10kg personal PR! Looked like it moved in slow motion, but it was smooth all the way up.

**Summary**

I went 8/9 with a 557.5 kg / 1229 lb total, and PR'd my squat, deadlift, and total! I've competed at EA before, but the atmosphere was nowhere like it was this time with so many members also competing. Seeing everyone else hyped and hitting PRs made the day even better.

Next week I'm starting the Unity program from John Meadows and Dave Tate. I've been wanting to try out some of John's bodybuilding style training since I need to get bigger. Plus, this also give me some exposure to conjugate style training, or at least conjugate with training wheels. After that, I might try out a run of nsuns or something for a while before hopping back on SBS. My main goal for next year is to drive my bench up as much as I can, so gaining weight will definitely help with that. As far as competing, I'm not sure when my next comp will be. I think I'm going to try a novice strongman show sometime early next year to see what that's like.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Competed in my first full meet. Had previously done a bench only. Was really looking forward to it and am pleased with the results. Came in hoping to get a squat PB at the very least. 

**The Meet**

Weighted in at 61.2kg so well under 63. Ate a lot today mostly sweets. Started off squats with 102.5 kg which was a good lift. Went for 110kg for my second attempt also a good lift. Had previously hoped to get 120kg on my third but decided to go for 117.5kg instead, which I got 2 whites for. 

Bench I always struggle with. Opened at 40kg which was under my comp best of 42.5kg. 2 whites for that. The second attempt at 45kg flew up, best bench I've done in ages. 3 white lights. Third attempt got ambitious went for 50kg which moved of my chest but then came back down. 3 reds.

Deadlift opened conservative at 100kg. 3 whites. My second attempt was 115kg which felt a bit pukey. 3 white lights. My last attempt went for 122.5kg and PB which came up. 3 whites.

Finished my first full comp with 2 PBs and a meet PB. Will probably move to U57s next time and see what I can do there. 

If mods need videos for proof. I am happy to send them over private, as I don't want my name associated with my account.","powerlifting, fitness"

\*\*Overview\*\*

This last weekend I Competed at my 11th powerlifting meet and totalled 907.5kg at 147kg bodyweight and achieved my lifetime goal of totalling 2,000 pounds in sleeves. My first competition was in 2013 where I hit a 535kg total in the 110kg weight class, and in the 8 years since then I’ve added 372.5kg to my total, or around 46.5kg a year for 8 years (not how it broke down but a fun statistic nonetheless). I’m going to use this meet report as a bit of manifesto writeup on the all the things I’ve learned these last 2 years since my last competition and what I felt really made realizing this goal possible. \[So if you just want to see the lifts here you go\]([https://www.instagram.com/daveatops/](https://www.instagram.com/daveatops/))

The first thing I wanted to talk about in this post is setting big goals and what it feels like for me to have achieved something I’ve been working for since I started powerlifting 8 years ago. Almost immediately into starting powerlifting I decided that I wanted to hit a 2k in sleeves and that I didn’t care at what weight class it happened just that I could do it. I was 24 years old at my first meet and had already been training in the weight room for years and through my time in the Marine Corps had experienced life at a variety of weights on my 6’1 frame (my lowest in boot camp was 169lbs and my highest in service was 255lbs). I knew that if I could continue to eat and put on weight, that I should be able to continuously get stronger over the years and begin to hit peak strength at the 10-year mark (around 34-35). 4 years later from my first meet I had grown into the 140kg weight class from 110kg and put 265kg on my total. This led to my first attempt at a 2k total at IPL World’s in 2017. There I tore my quad on my opening squat at 302.5kg and I spent the rest of 2018 rehabbing that quad and eventually hitting a 852.5kg total after working with Trevor Jaffe. Prior to today that had been my highest total as I dropped my deadlift on 2nd attempts at my following meet in 2019. So, I knew the next time I competed I wanted to have 2k in the pocket and not have any doubts about dropping a deadlift. On meet day I found myself in a fantastic place between confident and excited and really just go to focus on executing my lifts to the best of my ability. When I finally stepped up for my 2nd deadlift to seal the deal on 2k I knew it was there and held it at the top for a bit to really savor the feeling. I looked out on a sea of my friends and family wearing #Dave2k shirts and just had the greatest feeling of pride and accomplishment wash over me. I’ve been smiling ever since Saturday and really don’t plan to ever stop. I was worried that as soon as I hit it I’d be thinking about the next total but really I feel massive contentment and happiness hitting this goal and being able to appreciate all of the work, education, pain, and sacrifice of the last 8 years to finally realize this dream total. It feels like an enormous burden lifted off my body and that I feel free to revel in it. So my advice for younger lifters is to not sell yourself short but commit to realizing your competitive dreams and make that dream so high and difficult that when you finally hit it you can appreciate having finished the race and where you placed, and not be immediately overcome by feelings of more more more. 

\*\*Training\*\*

I came up with a 2-year linear progression and velocity regulated training plan that consisted of training 2 days a week (which had worked well besides the bar drops in my 2019 meet) that would have me deadlifting the first day and then squatting and benching the 2nd day. My previous meet prep had been successful with 2 days a week and I didn’t want to deviate from a plan I knew that I could stick to regardless of my doctoral schoolwork or family life schedule. I also knew that I would have to lift big PRs in the gym that I had never hit on the platform and needed a way to progress up to those loads safely over time. What I wanted to achieve was maximum momentum building of progressing either a set, a rep, or weight every week back-to-back for as long as possible without deloading. I started at very easy and doable weights which was 585 for squat and deadlift, and 405 for bench. For squat and deadlift I would progress from one top single followed by a back off variation (hi bar pause for squat and deficit or snatch grip for dl) to a top triple. Once I hit the weight for 3 reps I would add 20lbs and repeat the progression. If there were weeks where I couldn’t add a rep I would add a set. This got me to around the 655 mark on squat and the 675 mark on deadlift. For bench I started with my old progression of turning 405 for 5 sets of 1 into a 5x5 over 5 weeks, add 10lbs, and repeat until I couldn’t do 5 reps, then drop the rep target down to 3 reps and repeat. This prep I hit 475 for a triple, and 485 for doubles which were big PRs with a rep or two left in the tank still. 

Eventually I found I couldn’t add the reps that I wanted on squat and deadlift and moved to performing a top single followed by back offs. These singles started around the 655 mark for squat and deadlift, and ended at 722 for squat and deadlift at 3 weeks out. The way I built progression into these was if I didn’t add weight to the top single the following week I would add a rep or a set to the back off work. After a period of 3-6 weeks doing that I would eventually be able to progress up the top single. By the end of this meet prep I had 16 weeks squatting above 705 and over 12 weeks above 705 on deadlift, this greatly boosted my confidence that these numbers would be there on meet day and that I would be strong enough to hit my goal total. The only draw back on this training was the low volume and so I had to make sure I stayed on top of my accessories and did around 3 accessory movements (split squats, cable rows, 1 leg glute bridges, kb swings, amrap pushups, bottoms up kb press, and db bench being the main ones) on each training day for 2-3 sets of 8-15 reps. Weeks I skipped accessories eventually led to either stallouts or deloads but when I stayed on top of my accessories there was always a progression available on the following week. 

In regards to bar speed I knew that once I started grinding reps I had very little room to improve the following week. That’s why I started so light and gave myself the time to build up into the heavy poundages when it mattered (the last 20 weeks of my training cycle). By keeping the bar speed fast, I was rarely in a position where I couldn’t be fully recovered for the next training day. This high weekly recovery rate allowed me to continuously hit heavy loads without the need for any deloading or wasted training days. It also ensured I didn’t lift too heavy during my peak as I knew what certain weights would move at speed wise and let me pick very accurate testing loads at 3 weeks out. 

To compliment my training, I really began honing my visualization practice and mindfulness training. Each day I spent around 10-15 minutes both doing breath work and visualizing my final competition lifts along with going through dry runs of the lifts in the air without weight and visualizing how I wanted them to move on competition day. This let me get in thousands of repetitions of the movement pattern I wanted to replicate on the platform and prepared my mind greatly for the 2k goal. I credit this training with allowing me to improve each one of my platform lifts to where the 3rd attempt felt the best on both squat and deadlift and my 2nd deadlift was a sealed deal before even picking it up. I could feel where my body was off during the lift and knew exactly what to do to correct it in the moment and prevent it from happening on the following attempt. The work I did on sports psychology I feel really improved my ability to execute at the competition and gave me a ridiculous amount of skill practice over the years to draw upon for making in the moment corrections.

Finally, to compliment my high recovery training plan I finally got my nutrition dialed in to compliment my already insanely anal sleep schedule. For a long time, I tried to be strong despite my nutrition and finally following the examples of my lifters I began to cook the actual amount of protein I needed a day, talk to my wife and create an eating plan that would be separate from her and my son (we’re all much happier), and aim to have a consistent eating schedule that I could maintain while travelling (which I actually did and am super proud of). I’m really glad I gave up being stubborn here and just embraced the full process. In cases where I forgot to food prep or cook I made my wallet hurt and ordered food that hit what I needed for the day. Typically a few days of lazy ordering out was enough to snap me out of my lack of wanting to meal prep and I would be good for another couple weeks. Most days I would have 2 10 oz ny strips, 4-5 cups of rice, 3-5 eggs, 1 cup of shredded cheese, 8 oz of smoked sausage (or 6 strips of thick cut bacon), 2-3 50g METRX canned protein shakes, an Athletic Greens shake, and a giant bowl of honey bunches of oats and chocolate milk. My bodyweight stayed between 315 and 330 for the majority of prep. For sleep because I wake up at 4am for work I made sure to setup my coaching schedule at the gym to morning and an evening time block. So, when the morning ended at 9am I would come home and eat, sleep till 1230, eat when I woke up, and then had back to my 3pm coaching group. So, each day I was able to get at least above 7.5 hours. I really started to feel the momentum of sleep and nutrition at about 12 weeks out and it helped me to stay consistent during the most critical parts of my meet prep.

My best lifts of the prep for squat was a \[705x2\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuE0cXAizV/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuE0cXAizV/)) that I hit in July followed by a \[722 squat at 3 weeks out for my heaviest squat of the prep\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYX6lDDsPL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYX6lDDsPL/)) 

For bench at about 13 weeks out I had a grade 2 tear in my left pec I got on a 485 double. I normally squat first then bench, but wanted to hit a big bench that day without being fatigued for a squat. I went through my warmups too fast and wasn’t warm enough for the lift and felt it tear on the first rep and then more again on the 2nd. I rehabbed that back pretty fast using isometric pin presses and the duffalo bar and ensuring I spent every day putting the pec through ranges of motion it could handle. About 4 weeks later I hit a 470 on the duffalo and felt it was strong enough to start pushing again. This prep I hit a \[500lbs duffalo bench\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUiaDEcDzKe/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUiaDEcDzKe/)), another 485x2 for redemption, and my final heavy bench at 3 weeks out was 505 on a straight bar\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYc6Utjxqd/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVYc6Utjxqd/)) where my butt came up and just a general shit show. I still felt relatively confident going into bench because I knew what improvements I could make if I took the time to warmup and setup correctly and not just lay down on the bench and press like a lazy shw. 

For deadlift this prep my biggest point of focus was getting used to kilo plates and getting as many 700+ pulls in as a I could where my grip was secure at the top. I hit a \[683 off a deficit\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUa\_Vi1Db4Y/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUa_Vi1Db4Y/)), a \[705x2 dl with kilos\]([https://www.instagram.com/p/CUIvrW-BhUf/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUIvrW-BhUf/)), and a heaviest pull of \[722 at 3 weeks out\]( [https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRA0w6DKi7/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVRA0w6DKi7/)). 

\*\*Competition\*\*

Chris Bridgeford had originally told me about this competition at the US Open back in April, I was already planning on doing a meet in the November time frame so it ended up working great and I was pumped to be using a mono. I normally walkout my squats and was excited to really learn how to use a mono well with my setup. The week of the competition my wife and I drove down on Thursday afternoon 5.5 hours to Vancouver, WA and met up with my good friend and lifter Nathan Brandhorst and his gf Kayla who’s another one of my lifters. I had 3 lifters competing in this meet alongside me which made it an extra special day to see them all hit very big total PRs (Kayla a 45lb total pr, Dylan a 130lb total pr, Nathan 109lb pr and 2105 sleeve total). Weighed in Friday morning, ate food, hydrated like demons and did mobility work for the rest of the day. I had two lifters come in Friday afternoon and train at Generation Strength while another was doing weigh ins. So I went to coach them for that and hang out and move around some more. 

The crew at Generation Strength is really top notch and something else. The atmosphere they have created there is really a special thing and all of the lifters benefitted from the inaugural WRPF meet in Washington State. We really felt like the superstars that day and the meet was run well, on time, and with great equipment for the lifters to use. 

My plan for the meet was to secure my 2k total by my 2nd deadlift which means I would need a 340kg squat, and anything above a 232.5kg bench. 

\*\*Squat\*\* \[3/3 50lb pr at 749.5\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWBwwkIB3iv/)

Warmups went really well. I brought my tendo unit and was setting velocity prs on every warmup set. Missed the rerack in the mono at 172.5kg but ended up being fine. Last warmup at 285kg moved above a .5 m/s. I’m used to lifting on carpet which I can torque and root into really well. Lifting on rubber was something I knew I would need to be extra anal about with my setup and make sure that I was in the right place before unracking.   
 

Opener at 310kg- had my rack height set one notch too high so was really difficult to unrack at first. Finally got set in the right spot to pop it out but was a little more shakey than I wanted to be. Ended up being deep and fast  
 

2nd at 327.5kg- dropped the mono height down and had an easier time unracking. Bar felt like it rolled down on me a bit on the unrack and ended up fighting it down too much trying to stay balanced. Ended up forward and had to use my low back to save it. Since I knew what I did wrong and that I just needed to stop fighting the bar I made my planned jump to 340kg.  
 

3rd at 340kg- I knew I'd be fine if I just rode the lightning and didn't fight it down. Practiced my position and technique a few times with air squats before my attempt was called and was confident I could lock it in. Walked up to the platform and got set, realized I was a bit too far back and rest and scooted my feet forward. Unracked, stayed over my feet, hinged my hips a hair more and drove the knees forward hard coming down. Hit the hole and felt a tightness above my left knee but kept my midfoot pressure and powered out of the hole hard and fast. When I passed halfway, I knew it was there and immediately started to yell in happiness.

\*\*Bench\*\* \[3/3 and a 11lb bench pr\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWBxkvohrvs/)

Bench warmups went well and I was able to keep my butt down the whole time. Last warmup around 200kg felt really good if just a bit heavy. But I told myself that's OK cuz the sport is lifting heavy things  
 

1st attempt at 220kg- good handout and descent, probably one of my best 485 benches.   
 

2nd attempt at 232.5kg- this matches my bench pr and was what I knew I needed to make 2k even remotely possible. Setup a bit too far back and had to press more straight up than I like.   
 

3rd attempt at 237.5kg- this would tie Nate and put the pressure on him to hit a 3rd bench to beat me. Then I found out he passed and I needed it to tie him and set myself up for the 2k. Setup further down on the pad, got my legs set perfect. Had a perfect handout from one of my lifters who came, Robin, and hit my descent tempo perfect. Had to wait a hair after the press command to come up cuz I wasn't ready and then just slammed on the gas. Felt fantastic.

\*\*Deadlift\*\* \[2/3 33lb PR\](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWByjhFBhsJ/) 

Warmups went fantastic. Every set felt better than the last and I was staying consistent with my teknik. Was really excited to hit the platform and secure that total.  
 

Dl opener at 310kg- I was a bit worried about my rooting cuz of the rubber platform and chalk and powder accumulation but just told myself to control what I can control. Smoke show and felt great. Gave me all the confidence in the world for my 2nd.   
 

2nd attempt at 330kg- I'd been visualizing this pull for months and I felt the most perfect combination of excitement and confidence walking up the platform. My good friend JP Price hooked me up with some classic Phil Collins Genesis and I looked out at the sea of #Dave2k shirts my friends were wearing and just knew it was gonna happen. Took my time getting my feet set, got my hands set well, hit my slack pull and stood up. Almost lost my balance at the top from how fast it was moving but stabilized and held on!! 2k total sealed and 8 years of powerlifting progress realized in an instant!  
 

3rd attempt at 340kg- This was my first time in a meet where I could actually pull something that I wanted to and test myself without trying to play catch up or just hold onto the bar. The setup felt good, bar came off the ground well, just didn't have the gas left in my legs to get the knees to lock once it got above. No drops tho!!

8/9 day with a 2000lb total and 121lb total PR at 325lbs. Good for 1st place in SHW and 2nd highest total of the meet and probably around 3rd for Best Lifter behind Nathan Brandhorst and Devon Porter. 

\*\*Plans going forward\*\*

I’ll probably do something like a real heavy bench daddy this week and see if I have enough strength left to go above my current pr at 715. The dl bar took a good bite out of my thumb so no pulling for a week or two. My left knee is sore as crap from squatting so will take a bit of time off there until the range of motion comes back. Mostly will just be some messing around and having fun for the rest of the year. 

Things I want to work on and improve for next time are adding in some sheiko pulls to my deadlift training before my top single to really seal in my Teknik with the kilo plates. For squat I’ll continue my normal training plan of a top single/double/triple and back off hi bar pause work after and will make use of my duffalo bar. For bench I’ll have lots of duffalo bar and bench daddy work. I really liked how my body felt paying attention to nutrition so I’ll most likely stay pretty consistent with that as well.

Now that the meet is over and done with my brain is freed up to finish my dissertation study. This has got me the most excited because it allows me to give back to this community that has given me so much over the years. I will be recruiting 10 male and 10 female intermediate powerlifters (dots between 300-399) for 12 weeks of free online coaching where we will be assessing the effects of coach and athlete communication scheduling on lifter mood, motivation, self-efficacy, and the coach-athlete relationship. More details on that recruiting process will be released soon and I’m very excited to be conducting first of its kind research that will go towards benefitting our sport for both the athletes and coaches. Again, I’d like to thank this community for everything I’ve learned here over the years, the friendships I’ve made, and the support that’s been provided here for me. None of this would be possible without the influence of the reddit community of strength athletes and all the knowledge shared here over the years. I sincerely hope that everyone’s big lifelong goals are realized through the lessons we learn and share in this community and the support we have for one another.","powerlifting, fitness"

**Background Info** 

You may remember me from my previous [*“OVERTRAINED”* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I deadlifted 605-750+ every day for 50 days, I also have written about a few other programs and misadventures such as “Simple Jack’d”, “Smarathlov”, and then there is always that one LP lingering around… 

  

Shortly after my deadlift every day experiment I competed in a powerlifting meet, where [I deadlifted 325kg / 716.5 pounds to set a new state record in the Men’s 220lb weight class](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/qa0s1z/i_broke_my_states_deadlift_record_yesterday_at_34/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an increase of 50lb over the previous record, and narrowly missed a 749 pull on my third attempt when my thumb tore. 

  

After the meet I just took some time to have fun and train by feel for a bit. 

  

--- 

**A new challenger appears** 

  

In late October, I was chatting with a friend who is a successful bodybuilding coach, and we were talking about progress on lifts, and worthwhile goals to pursue in the offseason. 

  

He challenged me to race him to a 405x5 bench. 

  

At the time my bench was languishing around ~350x4 / 405x1 after months of neglect. I figured this would be a fun goal, and something that would take me 3-6+ months to achieve, but then he added a deadline… January 1. 

  

I don’t like to lose, and when I have a goal in mind, I get hyper-focused on it. So taking what I have learned from past experiments with high frequency, I decided I was going to bench every single day until I hit 405x5 

  

Over the years I have experimented with many different setups for high frequency training. From my earliest attempts of mimicking the *""Bulgarian Method""* of maxing out every day, to *""Simple Jack’d’s""* more reserved setup of a 6 rep daily minimum, I have learned a lot.  

  

**During DLED I kept things simple.**

1)	Deadlift 3 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Deadlift 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

That was it, and it worked great. However, shortly after the experiment was over, my maxes started dropping off quite quickly.  

The Daily Deadlifting had succeeded in getting me a stronger 1RM, but it lacked the volume to drive longer term, sustainable growth. I had essentially just PEAKED my deadlift. 

  

I wanted to try something a bit different for bench. 

  
---

  

**ENTER:** **The** **P**ress **E**very **D**ay **s**ystem (aka **PEDs**) 

  

PEDs is essentially a combination of Simple Jack’d and DLED. It incorporates a bit more variation, and structure to SJ, and a lot more volume to DLED. It was set up as follows 

1)	Bench 4 reps at 85% Every Day.    

2)	Bench 1 Rep at 95% once per week.   

3)	Bench 40/30/20/10+ Reps for Volume – EVERY OTHER DAY 

4)	No hype, no grinding on daily reps.   

  

So with a 405 bench max, and a 275 incline bench max, a single day might look something like this: 

* Paused Bench - 2 sets of 2 reps at 345 

* Incline Bench – 5 sets of 8 reps at 195 

* 1-2 assistance lifts. 

And that’s it. Its simple, straight forward, and you move on with your day. 

  

You can find [the **full program outline** I set up, as well as a log of all my sets/reps, and a third sheet to show it in terms of training percentages here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IG5LnMSOedRzV8obf5GqxBDy5tUzRbh4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)if you are interested in that, the log also contains hyperlinks to videos from each day.

**The Race** 

I was starting the race with a clean 1rm of 405, and a 4RM of ~350ish 

  
* On Day 2 my challenger hit 365x3 to take the lead. 
* On Day 5 I tried to bench 375x4, but was only able to grind out 3 reps. 

  375x3 was a true max here, an e1rm of ~413. This still put me back in the lead by a small margin... for about 5 minutes. 

Later that very same day [my challenger hit 385x4](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/comments/qnsmb9/175x4_today_i_was_told_these_slides_give_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and blew my 375x3 out of the water, retaking the lead. 

...however,  this would be the last time he'd take the lead. 

  

* Day 11 - I tied up the race with 385x4 but that 4th rep was a huge grind. 

* Day 15 - I hit a nice clean 435 paused bench. This did not go toward the competition,  but still a great milestone. 

* **Day 17 - I finally re-took the lead, with a big 396x4 bench**.   
This brought my e1rm up to 448, a 35lb increase over day 5. 

* Day 19 - was my first attempt to rep out 405, and I got 3 reps, with a huge grind to finish the 3rd rep, and a small PR.   

* Day 21 - I took out the slingshot And hit 408x7, which was awesome. 

* Day 22 - I hit a 454 paused bench for an all time paused 1rm PR 

At this point my daily minimum had progressed from 4 reps at 345, to 4 reps at 385, and it was becoming quite heavy and harder to recover from, so I decided to stop pushing singles, since that's what drives my daily minimums up. 

* Day 23 - Another rep out at 405, this time brought me to 405x4, for a big PR.    

  
For a few days after that I hit minimums, and focused on setting PRs on some variations. During this time I hit 

* 396 Larsen Press 

* 253 OHP 

* 404x2 Duffalo Bench 

* 315x2 incline bench 

  
I also tweaked something in my pec during this time, so I spent a few days hitting lower RPE sets at 385+ 

* Day 30 - I benched 421x3, getting my e1rm into the 460+ range for the first time. Only 9 pounds away from the required e1rm for 405x5. 

* Day 31 - I hit 385x4 again, but this time it was with a close grip, and the bar moved so easily, despite my pec causing some pretty serious discomfort.  

  

That night I ate all the lasagna on planet earth. 

  

The next morning I woke up, and asked my friend /u/nrllifts to give me a number between 2 and 6. (Something we do once in a while to give each other rep goals) 

He said 5 

I told him that my goal would be 400x5 to attempt a new e1rm... 

But he rightfully shamed me. 

>>""I mean that would be cool and all. But who does 400 when 405 is right there..."" 

So.. on day 32, I went for the goal, and [**Hit 405x5**](https://imgur.com/a/671Hrku) **with ease.** 

  

  

After hitting my end goal, I decided to just push on for another 2.5 weeks of benching to see what other PRs I could scrape together. At this point, I updated my goals to  

* 455+ bench 

* 255+ OHP 

* 500+ Slingshot 

  

And despite coming down with a nasty cold/virus, which completely ruined week 5, I still managed to hit my daily minimums each day of 385x4, and hit all three of my new stretch goals, with a [**465 bench**](https://imgur.com/a/8h8m3wT), [**270 OHP**](https://imgur.com/a/TX9XMyE), and a [**501 slingshot**](https://imgur.com/a/o03WJ3y) bench. 

  
---

  

**Data / Summary** 

  

Overall I hit 901 reps over 70% in 50 days, for a total volume of 263,872 lb. That's means the average day worked out to be approximately 18 reps at 295, when accounting for all variations. 

  

The lowest daily weight I benched was 345, the highest was 465, and 501 with the slingshot. 

Those Reps broke down in the following way: 

* Flat Bench: 250 Reps (28%).   

* OHP: 195 Reps (22%).   

* Incline Bench: 122 Reps (14%).   

* Close Grip Bench: 167 Reps (19%).   

* Larsen Press: 138 Reps (15%).   

* Slingshot Bench: 29 Reps (3%).

**Specific Discussion** 

In my previous ***”OVERTRAINED”*** post, I touched on a couple important topics, they were: 

* Using Variation to combat Fatigue 

* Diet, Sleep, Recovery  

* CNS fatigue and overtraining 

* Pain and Injury 

I still stand by everything I stated in those sections, and would suggest that anyone interested in taking on high frequency training, or just learning more about it, give those a read [in the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pgeo9k/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_deadlifting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

  

For this post however, I want to shift my focus a little bit more to the “HOW” of daily training. Things I have learned about pushing a lift OVER and OVER again, to break through plateaus and set PR’s 

---
  

**Choosing your maxes** 

When you start out a program like this, you need to be conservative. I had to hit 4 reps at 85% of my 1rm every day, and follow that up with a ton of volume. So with that in mind 1RMs should be: 

RECENT: Something you’ve hit in the last couple weeks, not something you did 6 months ago at the end of a bulk. 

CLEAN: in the weeks leading up to this program, I had benched 415 and 425, but both times were Touch-and-Go, and both times my hips came off the bench. These reps would not count in competition, so they didn’t count toward a recent CLEAN 1RM. Pick something where you can keep your form nearly perfect. 

For variations, you should also try to pick RECENT and CLEAN maxes, but if you haven’t done a variation in a while, take a ballpark guess, and then round down. Can you hit 315 flat? Well, I’m sure you can do ~60% of that on an incline, so start at 185. If the first day is easy, blow a rep PR out of the water, and then adjust going forward.  

  

**Its better to start too light, than too heavy, you can always go UP.**  

---
  

**Approaching each day** 

Once you have your 1RM’s selected, you can start training. With my setup, each day I was expected to hit 4 reps at 85% or higher.  

Now, like Simple Jack’d and DLED, this doesn’t have to be in a single set of 4. There is no rep scheme. You just have to complete 4 total reps.  

  

*Why 4?* 

Because it limits you. 

Because it improves you. 

If you only had to do 1-2 reps, you would be tempted to go a lot heavier, more often. Even on DLED with 3 reps, I found myself exceeding the minimums extremely regularly. With 4 reps, if you go too heavy, you will struggle to finish them all.  

4 reps also seems to be a sweet spot for me, in that its not too much that my form starts to slip, and not too little, that I don’t get adequate practice. Its decently heavy, for 1-4 sets, then I move on. 

So each day, you warm up, and work your way up to a couple top sets. If the warmups are absolutely flying and feeling light, maybe you go a bit heavier. Hit a double at 90% or 95%, maybe try a new 1RM single. But remember, after you are done, you still need to finish the remaining 4 reps, and then get your volume in. So you need to choose wisely. 

---

**Fluctuations in recovery, and variations in performance**

When you undertake something like this, with an extremely high frequency, not every day is going to be a great day. You will have days where 85% feels like 95%, and you will have days where 95% feels like 75%.

**Its all a part of the process**

You need to lean into these fluctuations, and take them as they come. If you are having a down day, don't be afraid to just hit your minimums and be done. It is perfectly fine to just stack a brick in the wall and leave.

On better days, push yourself, see what you are capable of. Hit a new max, or better yet, a big Rep PR.

When the bad days come, and they will, dont let them get you down. Think about what went wrong, was it a lack of sleep? poor diet? too much stress at work? or just a one off thing.

If its an issue that can be addressed, address it. I usually find that a couple days of hitting just the minimums, while focusing on eating and sleeping enough, goes a long way toward preparing for a great day down the road. Which leads me to the next point...

---

**Planning ahead**

Due to the constant fluctuations in performance and recovery, you cannot expect every day to be great. Because of this, it can often pay to plan out your big PR attempts a few days in advance.

When I was preparing for my 465 bench, I started 5 days in advance. 

* For the first two days I hit some moderately heavy reps in the 90% range, followed by a decent amount of volume. The goal was to over-reach.
* The third day I hit a very heavy single on the slingshot. Acclimating myself to heavy loads, but dropping volume.
* The fourth and 5th day, all volume was dropped, and I just hit a couple reps in the 88-92% range to dial in my technique and stay fresh.

And this set me up for a huge PR that I had previously missed when I wasn't as prepared.

---

**Choosing Variations for volume** 

Choosing the right variations is all about deciding what you think you need most. I picked OHP and Incline, because my overhead work has always really lagged behind my flat bench, and I wanted to fix that. 

I chose close grip bench and slingshot, because my triceps are consistently the weakpoint in all my pressing. 

I chose Larsen Press because it is a low-recovery cost way to get additional benching in. it is something I can do even when I am feeling exhausted. 

Once you choose your variations, stick with them, give them a few weeks to shake out. 

  

---

**On PerFEcT FORm and TeCHNique** 

I do not believe there is a *1-size-fits-all Perfect Form*, but I also do not subscribe to the increasingly popular mindset that form doesn't matter.

  

I believe I fall into a third camp, and I want to take a moment to explain it, and why it is relevant to this post. 

  

**1)** I believe that a new lifter, someone who has never touched a barbell, or played competitive sports, should start out focusing on proper form, following the more textbook definitions of each movement.    

They do not have the muscle mass built up, the technique for proper bracing, or the knowledge of their own bodily mechanics, to start messing with things. They should learn to Squat/Bench/Deadlift/whatever, in a “pretty”, “clean”, manner, before they really push the intensity and volume too hard. 

  

***It is important that the new lifter does not get STUCK in phase 1 forever. They need to move to phase 2, to continue to advance***. 

  

**2)** Once a trainee has demonstrated that they have some semblance of an understanding of the lifts, they can start experimenting with adjusting technique for their own bodies, but more importantly, just learning how to lift hard and heavy.    

**Many of the readers here in /r/weightroom are firmly in this category. You know how to lift, and now its time to bust ass for a few years and just get bigger and stronger.  This is a fun place to be. Enjoy it, get big and strong, see how much you can push yourself**.    

  

***However… I believe that it is important that the intermediate lifter does not get STUCK in phase 2 forever. They need to move to phase 3, to continue to advance***. 

  

**3)** The third phase is one that is constantly overlooked. It comes when a trainee has demonstrated that they know how to put in the work. They have trained hard for years, they have progressed though the beginner stages, through the intermediate stages, they probably have some pretty impressive lifts, and would be quite competitive in local competitions.    

   This is the lifter, that needs to step out of phase 2, and learn, once again, how to *PERFECT* their technique. This is not to say they need to move toward the textbook perfect form. They need to PERFECT the form for **THEIR OWN** bodies. 

  

These technique improvements are how we transition our good lifts, into GREAT lifts. 

  

**And that’s the purpose of high frequency.**

  

Programs like this, or Simple Jack’d, or DLED with the daily focus lifts, work by allowing the trainee to dial in their technique through repeated practice. 

  

* You don’t become a better pianist by playing the piano once per week. 

* You don’t become a better linguist by studying Spanish for 30 minutes here and there. 

* I didn’t bring my bench from 405 to 465 in 50 days by just packing muscle onto my pecs and triceps. It just doesn’t work that quickly. 

  

I did it by ***GETTING BETTER*** at bench. It’s a skill, and you need to practice it. 

  

  

So if you are still in the early phase of learning how to do your lifts, or moving into the second stage of just crushing volume and intensity and building consistency, that’s fine, this post is something you can read, hopefully enjoy, and maybe some day come back to in the future. 

But if you are a more advanced lifter, and you’ve been hammering yourself with barbell lifts for years, and they still look like dogshit. It might be time to fix that.  

I’ll join you with my dogshit squat, which is the next lift on my table to be fixed up.","powerlifting, fitness"

Link to meet recap/videos on this post [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTvYITIMq8P/)

* **Background**

Been powerlifting for about two years (little less if we're counting the break from COVID closures) and this is my second meet. First meet was December 2020 and I totaled 317.5kg weighing 70kg at the time. My coach advised I try harder to gain weight and move into the 83 class as I'm about 5'11"" and I have a frame to support 83kg and/or 93kg in the future.

This meet was on the opposite corner of New York from where I live which made it an 8-hour drive. Thankfully I had some people with me to share the car ride. Booked an AirBnB for two nights so we could drive over the day before and leave the morning after the meet. I had goals to meet or slightly exceed my gym PRs at this meet. I haven't done many heavy singles in training recently, so I was unsure of how strong I had become leading up to meet day.

* **The lifts**

Squat

1. 120kg- Sunk this squat lower than I needed to by a longshot. Extra depth for good measure just makes me feel like I have less to worry about.
2. 130kg- Still a very deep squat but no issues here. This weight was a little past the limit of my recent training. My heaviest triple was 127.5kg and that was 4 weeks before this. Happy that it was feeling as easy as it did.
3. 140kg- I told my coach/handler that I didn't want to know the attempts on squat because I was anxious. It really screwed with my head that I hadn't done any singles in the last 2/3 weeks of prep. Strong walkout, really slow descent, equally slow ascent. This one made me feel like my head was going to explode. White lights, good lift, found out after that it was an 8lb PR over my gym PR and 40kg over my meet PR.

* Bench

1. 72.5kg- head judge had me hold the pause for a very long time. I'm a pretty skinny guy (not much muscle or fat in the pecs) and I can get a little shaky holding my breath during a pause bench so the bar wasn't perfectly motionless. Thankfully this was the only attempt where I had this issue.
2. 77.5kg- Solid second attempt. Press command came earlier than the last.
3. 82.5kg- Matched my gym PR with this and it was way cleaner than when I did it at the gym. I was also on a Rogue fat pad when I hit the gym PR and the bench at this meet was pretty stiff and slippery. Very pleased with my performance here.

* Deadlift

1. 140kg- Light. No comments
2. 150kg- Moved like an opener.
3. 155kg- Gym PR is 162.5kg and in hindsight, I had at least 160 on meet day for sure. I overestimated how tired I was after my second attempt so I took the 5kg jump. Either way though, it rounded off a perfect scoring meet and I'm proud of that.

* **Final Thoughts**

I'm not the strongest so I was a bit embarrassed about sharing my numbers, but I hope my perspective is helpful for some. Looking forward to taking some time to put some pounds on and working on hypertrophy over the winter. I didn't think I would weigh in as light as I did for this meet so I'm really going to have to work on eating more to fill out my frame.

Thanks so much for reading and have a good one!","powerlifting, fitness"

Has anyone here used a reverse hyper to help build their squat and deadlift.

Most of the time the reverse hyper gets recommended as a rehab for lower back issues.

Outside of westside barbell material you rarely hear about the positive strength increases gained from a reverse hyper machine.

Who here has noticed a strength increase in squat and deadlift from using the reverse hyper?","powerlifting, fitness"
"**PREP**

I took a 32 week break between my last competition in March and this one. I wanted to build a fair amount of muscle to hopefully have that translate to a bigger total, so my coach /u/agent21emh came up with a number of training blocks that included a lot of hypertrophy work that I believe paid off immensely when it came time to peak. Our main goal coming into this competition was a 635 kg/1400 lbs total, and we went through a ton of back and forth/discussion about how we would get there. He is a great coach and I'm lucky to work with him and call him a friend.

**MEET**

Used the water cut guide from /u/rawrylynch (https://sisyphusstrength.com/blog/2018/6/25/how-to-water-cut-like-a-pro) to manipulate my water/sodium levels to cut from 85.2kg/188 lbs, and ended up weighing in at 82.0kg/180.8 lbs. This was interesting to me because I had cut from a lower beginning bodyweight last competition, and weighed in heavier. I woke up at 82.3kg/181.5 lbs, and weigh in for my session was at 1:30 PM, so I was able to have 24 ounces of gatorade and some rice crispy treats before I weighed in, and still ended up very light. Next competition, I will begin my cut with a beginning bodyweight closer to 86.2kg/190 lbs.

**SQUAT** 

ATTEMPT 1: 210kg/463 lbs 

https://streamable.com/8wyoyp

This was my first competition after making the transition to low-bar squatting. Obviously it was uncomfortable at first, but thanks to the long break between competitions, my body was able to make the necessary adaptations and respond accordingly. The first squat for me is always the hardest and moves the worst. I was happy to get this on the board and move forward. Good lift

ATTEMPT 2: 220kg/485 lbs

https://streamable.com/psc4rh

This was a 2.5kg/6 lbs all time PR. Erik and I had spoken about attempt selection for this competition, and decided on taking a PR for my 2nd based on how my last heavy squat of 215kg/474 lbs during prep moved. This lift felt very easy and moved relatively well. This squat meant a lot to me, it was my first squat PR since July 2020, over 15 months ago. After a brief discussion, we decided to go with the heavier planned 3rd. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 227.5kg/501 lbs

https://streamable.com/ae5sfg

This is a 10kg all time PR (best coming in to the meet was 217.5kg/479 lbs). Can't really describe my mindset going in to this lift, but I was beyond focused for it. This is the most weight I've ever attempted, and honestly after seeing the video I may have had another 5kg. Our original plan for this attempt before the competition was a top end of222.5kg/ 492 lbs, but after discussion we decided to have this weight be the top end, and that ended up making all of the difference for my total. Feels kind of cool to break a big barrier of a 500 pound squat. Good lift.

**BENCH PRESS** 

ATTEMPT 1: 147.5kg/325 lbs

https://streamable.com/za4qri

Bench press had been moving and feeling incredibly well this prep. I was able to hit an all time PR in training during my last heavy session (with that being 157.5kg/347 lbs). The transition to low-bar squatting had caused me to suffer from some bicep pain during training, but it would almost always dissipate shortly after and not affect my strength too much. Good lift here

ATTEMPT 2: 155kg/342 lbs

https://streamable.com/5gpicu

I was hoping that this would move insane so I could convince Erik to let me take a moonshot at 165kg/363 lbs for my third attempt so I could achieve a 2x BW bench in comp, but sadly this actually felt kind of difficult so I didn't even bring it up and we stuck with our plan for the 3rd. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 160kg/353 lbs

https://streamable.com/pqs27i

2.5kg/6 lbs all time PR, and a 5kg/11 lbs competition PR. Honestly not a ton to say about this lift. Erik made the right call and this was probably the most I had on the day. Not quite 2x BW yet, but still cool to break a 350+ pound bench in competition and have a good contribution to my total. Good lift.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 232.5kg/513 lbs

https://streamable.com/pq2ey9

This was a weight that both Erik and I knew I could nail in my sleep, and it moved and felt pretty well. Good lift.

ATTEMPT 2: 245kg/545 lbs

https://streamable.com/fkhwh2

This was actually the largest jump I've ever taken in competition. Our plan ended up working out well, I was able to go 6/6 on my Squat and bench, PR both, and then secure the 635 kg/1400 lbs total on my 2nd deadlift, so that I could take whatever was there on the day for my 3rd. Felt very nice to break my 3rd big milestone of the day, this one being the most important to me. Good lift

ATTEMPT 3: 255kg/562 lbs

https://streamable.com/6ykrbv

In hindsight, I should've been more vocal about how I was feeling and dropped this to 252.5 kg/556 lbs. It would've been nice to PR all of my lifts and my total, but you live and you learn. While it's possible I have the strength to hit this weight when I'm fresh, my grip did not hold up and that's something I will havwe to work on moving forward. No lift, but my spirits were not broken as I had achieved the primary goal of the day already.

**RESULTS**

Was able to PR my squat, bench press, and total by 10kg/22 lbs, 5kg/11 lbs, and 15kg/33lbs respectively. There are some incredibly strong lifters in the northeast, and I did not go in to this competition expecting to win my division or even place. I ended up 7th in the 83kg division and was able to see some really strong individuals put on incredible performances, and I hope to be in their shoes one day. But I was able to hit my main goal of a 1400 pound total, and maybe had another 5kg on squat, and 5kg on deadlift, so I am very happy with that.
 

**WHAT'S NEXT**

This meet happened last weekend, I just took a week off and vacationed in Miami, but I will be back on program and diet tomorrow to continue building my total as best as I can. I am directing a competition on January 8th and then again in March, so I will probably look for a competition during summer 2022 to make sure I can keep my priorities straight.","powerlifting, fitness"

"TL;DR - Went down a weight class to the 47s. Changes to the meet schedule (nationals) meant having to squeeze an unpeaked meet in after a quicker than planned cut, in order to compete in the new weight class in June. Went 7/8 (scratched last DL) and set a small bench AR. 

Background:

I started lifting in 2014ish mostly with CrossFit/CrossFit style classes, started powerlifting in 2017, and have competed mostly as a 52 (two for fun meets as a very light 57) since then. My last meet in mid December 2020, I hit a 32.5 kg total PR (totaled 387.5) and PRs on all of my lifts, weighing in at 50.1 kg with no cut and the max allowed clothing on during weigh ins. Following that meet, we decided to give me a month completely away from tracking and then slow cut to 47 kg range. The plan was to do a local qualifying meet in May or June, and then hit Nationals in October as a 47. 

...Then Nationals moved to June, so in mid- January, we had to switch gears, start a more aggressive cut, and rush to find a meet I could drive to and have some support at in March. Instead of training and peaking for a meet, we'd take RPE 8 or lower attempts, especially on squat and deadlift (more on that later), just to get me a QT. The next week would be a deload, and then straight back into my Nationals prep. 

Lead up:

Again, we didn't peak for this meet. Once the schedule changed, we cut my hypertrophy block a little shorter than initially planned. I've been basing my training around Nationals as the end goal, so we just kept with that. I started adding RPE 8 singles back in about 4-6 weeks out from the meet. I kept pretty close to my regular training on meet week, with no taper. We cut a tiny bit of volume and I was very aware of RPE/erred on the side of caution.

Making weight was the tougher goal. My normal maintenance is about 2,300 calories per day. I usually slow cut by dropping to about 2000. That wasn't going to do the trick for this timeline, especially as my weight dropped a little. I had to be at around 1,600 - 1,700 per day for the last 4 weeks. That and a bit of food/water manipulation during meet week got me within (literal) spitting distance of 47. It was stressful and I'd like to never be that stressed about the number on a scale again. 

Meet:

Squats: I tend to get the most in my head for squats, so I opened light.

117.5 kg: 2 white lights. I think I slightly jumped a rack command after accidentally pausing at the bottom for like 2-3 seconds [117.5 video](https://youtu.be/ttGZTyvn_QI)

125 kg: RPE lol, 3 white lights [125 video](https://youtu.be/ex0gWIKX6cs)

132.5 kg: Easy 7.5-8, but I got 2 red lights for depth. I'm not sure this was the right call, but I'm not mad about it either. I leave too much room for question here, and I know it. A major theme moving forward is getting me to hit a ""sweet spot"" on depth confidently and consistently. Being able to squat this for the RPE it was, under these circumstances, is a major confidence boost, and even if it's a failed lift, I'm happy about it. [132.5 squat](https://youtu.be/gYtDSXlEL04)

Bench:

77.5 kg @ RPE 6ish [77.5 kg bench](https://youtu.be/ru1Bz8KwQZA)

82.5 kg (first second attempt): I didn't push it exactly how I wanted to off my chest and was going to have to grind a little to get it back in place. The head ref saw me slow down, jumped the gun, yelled rack, and had the spotters steal the attempt from me. I immediately questioned it, and fortunately, everyone agreed with my assessment of the situation. There was no downward motion or reason to take the bar. I got a 3 minute clock to redo the attempt (of course with the warning that most people don't make that lift and just tire themselves out).

82.5 kg second second attempt: Easy. RPE 7. I will be the first to admit I think the head ref felt shitty and gave me a very generous press command here [82.5 kg bench](https://youtu.be/gHeBxK_tJxw)

My RPE 8 in training has been in the neighborhood of 190 lbs/86 kg recently. My coach and I agreed going in that provided I felt decent after my 2nd attempt, We'd try for the AR. I'd use my judgement to decide on the small .5 kg chip, 87.5 or anywhere in between. Given the excess fatigue from having to do two second attempts, I went with the smallest chip possible. That was the right call. 

85.5 kg: huge grind, but I got it. I expect I'm going to have to work hard to keep this come June. I'm not sure I will keep it, but I'll try my best. There are some badass benchers in the 47s and I'm so excited to get to share a platform with them. [85.5 kg bench](https://youtu.be/iF7U8Xaaga8)

Deadlift:

Again, I had a cap here, and that cap was pretty low. 

157.5 kg: RPE 5-6 [157.5 kg deadlift](https://youtu.be/d-da1A4nrt8)

165 kg: RPE 6.5-7 [165 kg deadlift](https://youtu.be/rTSwmPBXeR4)

Scratched third attempt

I'm now on the last day of my deload, and pretty excited (as well as pretty anxious) to move forward towards June.","powerlifting, fitness"
" TL;DR Best lift videos [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUAzQazvF1R/). 2nd place because /u/supernaturaltuna was there, 8/9, 800 kgs/1764 lbs, 452.95 DOTS (91.25 GL points), best attempts were 280/195/325. Missed 3rd bench at 200/441 because I didn't have much to lose by trying for it.

**Background and training**

First meet back after nearly 2 years (would be 2 years in October), after a short string of not so great meets (last 2 were 5/9 days without any PRs, and I can't remember if I posted about those or not). Pretty much just needed to do this meet to qualify for Provincials again since it's been nearly 3 years since my last APU/CPU meet.

Training for this one went incredibly well, considering the lockdowns and some injuries getting in the way. My biggest singles heading into the meet were all comfortable, at 267.5/197.5/315. All of those inspired enough confidence for coach and I to pick some pretty high (to me) openers, which I was not expecting when originally starting prep 10 weeks out.

**Meet Day**

It was a pretty relaxed competition day for me compared to some of the other meets I've done before. The meet was hosted at my gym, and on equipment I am very familiar with (all Eleiko). Didn't have to cut since I have now committed to the SHW life, so I had a pretty nice dinner the night before and breakfast the morning of, before weigh-ins. Came in at 125.4 kgs bw.

**Squats**

* 255 kgs/562 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites.
* 267.5 kgs/589 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites.
* 280 kgs/617 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites. This was a 7.5 kg lifetime and meet PR for me, and a very huge confidence booster for the future!

**Bench**

* 185 kgs/408 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites. 
* 195 kgs/430 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites. This was a 5 kg meet PR for me, and moved alright, but not great.
* 200 kgs/441 lbs - No lift. Just wasn't strong enough for it on the day, but wanted to try to gamble for it anyway since my placing wasn't at any risk, it was close enough!

**Deadlifts**

* 287.5 kgs/634 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites.
* 305 kgs/672 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites.
* 325 kgs/717 lbs - Good lift - 3 whites. This was a 15 kg meet PR and 10 kg lifetime PR for me (on a stiff bar). Decided to take an unplanned jump to make up for the missed bench and it paid off!

Ended the day 8/9 with an 800 kg/1764 lbs total (452.95 DOTS/91.25 GL), for a huge 29.5 kg total PR. Got 2nd place in my category, but I already knew this was going to happen going into the meet, and so my only goal was just to total 800 kgs. After having locked in a PR total with my 2nd deadlift, I figured I might as well give it a shot on the 3rd and the risk ended up paying off!

Biggest take away from the training leading up to the meet was that I really wasn't eating enough before and so I naturally wasn't as heavy as I really should be for my height. Now that this is no longer an issue, I expect that I will finally start making considerable progress once again. Got a lot of catching up to do before I can challenge /u/supernaturaltuna on the total again (never mind the other top SHWs in Canada)!","powerlifting, fitness"

\#THEN WELCOME TO THE FORTNIGHTLY EQUIPPED LIFTING THREAD!!!","powerlifting, fitness"
"TLDR: Super chuffed. I wanted to pull the highest deadlift nationally, I did it. 9/9. 525kg @ 72.8kg bodyweight. Watch the final deadlift.

Background: I’ve been an amateur powerlifter for some time. I always wanted to be strong, not just look strong. Started with SL 5x5 in 2017, then progressed to nSuns and CAP3. I am relatively tall for my class (181cm - I think this is 5'11"")

Meet prep: I kind of made my own program with bits and pieces I've picked up from this and other subreddits

Meet day: My weigh in was at 2 and I flew up, hired a car and drove 2 hours to the meet. I had to do a bit of a water cut as 3 weeks out, I was 78kg and needed to cut to 74kg. Manipulated carbs leading up to the meet and just limited water on the day. I injured my pinky 2 weeks before the event - deads were not feeling too strong leading up into the meet and felt a bit of a concern, but luckily they were not a part of my program a week out.

I entered in the Male/Open/u74kg/Raw category

Squat:

[Attempt 1: 155kg. No issues](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=2260)

[Attempt 2: 165kg. Felt easy. Nothing to write about](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=2751)

[Attempt 3: 170kg.Felt good. I went far too low down and didn't struggle too much.  Wanted to save myself for the deadlift](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=3191)

Bench:

[Attempt 1: 95kg. Bench has always been my weak point. I've never been particularly good at it and have bombed out on bench before.](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=6297) Wanted an easy opener

[Attempt 2: 100kg. 2 whites. 1 red. One of the judges had an issue with my foot and gave me a red. The other 2 were happy](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=6726)

[Attempt 3: 105kg. Wanted to play it safe. Fixed my foot issue and bench went up easily](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=7206)

Deadlifts:

My jam. My long ass legs and long arms must count for something. My aim going into this was to be in it to win it.

[Attempt 1: 225kg. No issues.](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=10312)

[Attempt 2: 240kg. Had done this in training a few times. Went in there ready for it](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=10695)

[Attempt 3: 250kg. In it to win in. If you only watch one lift. Watch this. I wanted to have the last lift of the day and used ammonia before this. I blacked out during the lift.](https://youtu.be/Ro0vSDDCSOU?t=11180) I have zero memory of it.

525kg total. Not too sure about IPF points (will update when the results are released)

Recap: 9/9. 170/105/250 for a 525kg total. My previously highest total was 500kg. Keen to keep on going! Wanted to win the deadlift nationally. Did it. I didn't place. Not even close. Credit to the lifters who are far stronger than I am. Will edit the post as I remember stuff! Also not too sure about points - I used online calculators

"Preface - everything was in lbs for this meet, sorry in advance. :)

This was my first official meet. Previously I competed in an informal virtual meet in July of 2021. I've been lifting seriously since November 2020, having done Stronglifts and various other linear programs before that without a lot of continuous focus.

I started with 531 last November, and switched to a peaking program for the July meet. Towards the end of that peak, I decided to hire an online-focused coach. I settled on  [/u/tweezy2eezy](https://www.reddit.com/u/tweezy2eezy/) / [@tweezy2eezy](https://www.instagram.com/tweezy2eezy/) and reached out. Antjuan has a >2k total under his belt and is super level-headed about training while still pushing hard. The coaching has been absolutely excellent - since that virtual meet, I've put 100lbs on my total, particularly growing like crazy on deadlifts, which is what I wanted!

If you're looking for virtual training, check Antjuan out here - [http://buffbarbell.com/](http://buffbarbell.com/) - it's super smooth.

**Background and Training:**

I played some sports in middle and beginning of high school, but dropped off for many years after that. I got back into some lifting in college, but never enough to call it a program. Last year, my wife and I built a house with a dedicated room for a home gym in the basement, so I decided to make the most of that commitment and built out my home gym.

Antjuan helped shape programming for my specific weaknesses, and responded no matter what within a day of sending lifts. He found inconsistencies and hammered them from day one.

**Lead Up to the Meet:**

My goal for the meet was 1200lb total, which would have been a 150lb increase. I wasn't trying to gain any weight - I gained about 9lbs, but most of that is probably because I didn't have a lot of discipline on the diet side of things; I could probably have seen the same gains with much less weight increase.

Antjuan's programming is definitely focused on competition readiness and fatigue reduction towards the end, with the final week or so really cutting back and focusing on ""eat and be merry.""

I didn't know what to expect necessarily going into my first meet. Antjuan helped me understand how some parts would go; every fed is different. SPF specifically has monos, for example, so I trained with monos in the last 4-5 weeks.

**Meet Day:**

I arrived early enough to weigh-in. Since I'm not trying to hit any specific weight goal, I didn't do a 24-hour weigh-in; instead I focused on getting good rest and not changing diet up too much.

Speaking of diet - my food intake for the day consisted primarily of low-sugar carbs. Four sandwiches (using white bread to avoid too much fiber intake), some sour patch kids, definitely a good amount of Legion preworkout, shortbread cookies, Gatorade, a few small Reese's, Gatorade energy chews, and some fig newtons. It's still a decent amount of sugar, I would probably cut that down in the future.

[Videos of Lifts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXb0NUqJzD_/?utm_medium=copy_link)

**Squats (2/3 405/430/450):**

Squats went great. I went in a little spooked - if you miss all three lifts on any given lift, you can't continue with the competition. I've had days where 405 just didn't want to move, but meet day it moved fine.

430 moved like a 9-9.5 - we chose 450 as a middle-road. Almost had it, lost some torso tightness.

As a sidenote, timing at meets is the hardest part for me. At home, I can just lift when I'm hyped and ready. At a meet, you have to time your hype just right, or else you'll come down too fast. The mental side at the meet was the hardest part for me.

**Bench (2/3 220/245/270):**

First two attempts went up no problem, third attempt got stuck in the hole. Bench has been the slowest mover for me, so we're going to be working from the pins in the ""off-season.""

**Deadlifts (2/3 440/475/500):**

I wanted 500 really badly, in retrospect I probably should have chosen 490 or so. First two went up fine, totally gassed out on 500; however, it did come up off the floor. I fully expect to pull 500 in the next month.

**Results and Plans Going Forward:**

6 of 9 is not what anyone shoots for, but 100lbs on my total is great progress. My goals are to become stronger, not to win every competition I'm in. That said, even with the misses, I walked away with the first place trophy in my weight class. While this is just a fun regional meet and nothing super serious, it really gives me the motivational fuel after a year or so to keep going and stay committed.

Definitely going to stick with Antjuan with this rate of progress - excited to see how things go from here, and some variety in off-season to work on weak spots. Looking forward to about 6mo of prep before my next shot on the platform!","powerlifting, fitness"
"Ok so it seems like there's nearly unanimous support for DOTS replacing Wilks in user flairs so let's make it official.

Now we're not going to enforce the transition, if you simply can't be bothered to update it or want to keep your Wilks score for some reason then that's up to you. And there is no way in hell that we are going to go and change every flair one by one. From now on though all requested flairs must include DOTS and only DOTS as a coefficient score. If you ask for anything else then you will be told to resubmit with the correct DOTS score.

[Here are the instructions for requesting flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/wiki/flair). It includes a link to a calculator where you can work out your DOTS, or just check your [Openpowerlifting profile](https://www.openpowerlifting.org) which automatically defaults to DOTS. **I suggest that everyone read it again** because we constantly have to get people to resubmit because they don't use the right spacing, spacers or all the correct elements.

**If you have requested new flair recently** and it has not been done yet (sorry) could you **please resubmit your request** with DOTS instead **AND DOUBLE CHECK THAT IT'S USING THE RIGHT FORMAT**. 

Lastly, given that there will probably be a massive influx of new flair requests, could you **please be patient. We will get to them all eventually.**","powerlifting, fitness"

"**Prep/Background**

This was my 12th overall powerlifting meet with a BOMB and a bunch of tiny 100% RAW meets peppered throughout. For the past ~2 years I've lifted out of an incredible gym in Louisville, KY called Everyday Athletes, where I've been coached by the owner, Chance Cianciola. He typically has me running 3 week mesocycles, with one squat, one deadlift, and two bench days per week. Nothing flashy with his programming, but he does an excellent job of targeting my weak points, listening to my issues, and making things as fun as possible. The overall training cycle this go around overall went really smooth, despite dealing with pneumonia, a new job, a toddler, and pregnant wife. Easily the best I've felt leading into a meet ever

**Meet Day**

The meet was held at Fit4Life 24|7 in Frankfort, which is a *huge* gym with lots of cool stuff, and its really centrally located around a lot of restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores, which was super convenient. In the past I've done a godawful job of eating and taking care of myself on meet day, and it's shown with my piss poor deadlift performance last meet. I made a very conscious effort to eat, basically all day long. Lots of oatmeal, bagels, apples, Qdoba, pretzels, basically anything I know my body likes. I also scaled *way* back on the caffeine and stimulants. Very successful there. 

**SQUAT**

I like squatting, squatting is my favorite

1: Opened at 265kg/584.3lbs. Shit. Flew. GOOD LIFT

2: Jumped to 277.5kg/611.9lbs, which was about a 5lb PR. As soon as I unracked I got super excited because I just *knew* it was going to be a smokeshow. Unfortunately I got too excited and cut it high, which is a shame because it also flew. NO LIFT

3: I stayed at the same weight, 277kg/611.9lbs. This also went up with ease, depth was good. GOOD LIFT for a lifetime PR

Part of me wishes I would have went ahead and jumped despite the bad lift, but I played it safe. 

**BENCH**

My bench has exploded over the past year. I was stagnant at about 390lbs for *years* until I just... wasn't? I just kept plugging away and grinding and early last year I broke through that plateau, and it's been climbing steadily since. 

1: I opened at 185kg/407.9. Moved like an opener. GOOD LIFT

2: I made an aggressive jump to 192.5kg/424.5lbs. Not sure why, I just saw that number on the page and had a gut feeling, and I was right. It was slower, but it went all the way up. GOOD LIFT for a lifetime PR

I opted out of a third attempt on bench. I *might* have has 195kg/430lbs in me, but I also knew I didn't want to really really grind for 2.5kg so I laid down instead. 

**DEADLIFT**

1: Opened at 277.5kg/611.9 and like the others, went up like it should. GOOD LIFT

2: Jumped to 285kg/628.4lbs, and it went up fairly easy, but definitely some grind to it. GOOD LIFT for a meet/kilo plate PR

3: Last attempt was 295kg/650.5lbs. I was *super* hyped for this, but it just wasn't there. I got it to my knees and *might* have been able to muscle it up, but I started to get that sparkly tunnel in my brain so I called it a day. NO LIFT. 

**TOTAL** 

755kg/1664.8lbs for a 65lb total PR. Ended up winning the 125kg Open and Submaster and *just narrowly* lost out on Best Overall. Not awful for a natty 36 year old living in a swirl of chaos. Going to take the next 4-6 weeks of serious training, enjoy the holidays, then maybe consider preparing for USPA Drug Tested Nationals in Atlanta next year.","powerlifting, fitness"

"Can we get a singlet thread going? Share your experience with singlets in terms of sizing, comfort, support, etc.  Not much info out there so a good chance maybe for people to share.  Here's what I have owned in the last 7 years (I am 6'1 and about 225 lbs currently):

- Asics basic singlet - very basic and cheap.  These stretch a good amount but I can't really fit my legs into my old medium size that I bought when I weighed under 200lbs.  Not bad for a first meet imo. Doesn't really provide any support and you feel naked basically but there is a small bit of warmth and you look j00cy in it

- inzer old school singlet - I think these are 100% polyester so no real stretch and really uncomfortable.  Perma wedgie, very short legs. Your dick is out.  They look cool but there are better options.  Only buy this if you are going to raw nats and you want the absolute cheapest singlet that is approved.  I can't even really fit into an XL

- metal 2 color slimfit singlet.  This was amazing.  Both thick and supple with a good fit.  I sized down wearing an XL weighing 220 or so (they recommend XXL on their chart) and felt like it was both warm and maybe a little supportive.  Also really nice coverage, it feels almost like wearing normal clothes but with compression.  I gave this away when the metal founder started saying dumb shit and got all their gear banned.

- Sbd original singlet - sbd was kindly offering exchanges of metal singlets for their old stock of discontinued singlets and I got one.  I did not like it at all.  It looked good and was very comfortable and stretchy but it felt very flimsy and thin. Felt like I was butt naked and my junk was totally out.  I sized down to an XL at 220lbs or so and the sizing was perfect bc of all the stretch but I never lifted in this because I didn't like the feel.

- Elitefts 2 color competition singlet - I saw this online and saw it looked very similar to the metal singlet. I thought it might be a racism-free white label version of the metal singlet but with different branding.  When I got it I thought it was pretty meh.  Unlike the metal singlet it is fully polyester so it does not have much stretch. Not particularly comfortable to lift in but it does the job and has pretty good coverage. At the bottom of a squat I feel the fabric basically at it's limit which is I guess good or bad.  Weighing 225 the XL is borderline too small on me. Not bad for the money,just wished the material was better.


I'm interested in hearing other people's experiences.  I know people say the titan singlets are the most supportive and comfy, but I wonder what other options people like.  Is the inzer power singlet (the more expensive one) similar to the titan triumph? Has anyone tried the Stoic singlet?  I heard the new version SBD singlet is upgraded heavyweight materials... Can anyone share their thoughts?","powerlifting, fitness"

"**APF River Rumble - Terre Haute, IN - 7 August 2021**

Videos of all lifts:
https://www.instagram.com/p/CSSv7WvAk9r/

**Background:**

I've done 5 or 6 raw meets but this was my first one in gear. Started in multi-ply briefs at the beginning of 2020 and slowly worked my way into the rest of the gear while still doing raw stuff including another raw meet in October 2020.

**Meet goals:**

Best gym numbers were 620/375/555. Any maximal attempt in the gear absolutely wipes me out so I knew I likely wouldn't have the gas to match all of my gym bests in one day even if I lifted perfectly. Figured 600/350/550 was likely enough; a little lower than my bests for squat/bench but deadlift has been on the upswing of late and is my best lift.

Really the only way I could have left this meet completely disappointed was a bomb out, but a 1500 lb total seemed like a reasonable goal as long as I didn't miss more than a couple of lifts.

**The meet:**

Drove out the day before (only about a 2.5 hour drive but the damn time zone change messed with my head a little) and weighed in at 177 (80.28kg). Oops. I'd been walking around at 185ish most of the past year so I just cut out some calories, carbs, and salt for a week or two. Overshot it and came in small. Ate the planet after weigh-ins but still couldn't get back to full size. This meant my briefs were a little loose. Did it affect me? Not sure since the suit's adjustable, but didn't help at any rate.

The meet was run in pounds because America (hence the wacky kg numbers in parenthesis).

**Squats:**

Squats are my favorite multi-ply lift because more weight = more fun. Thought 600 would be there no problem as long as I didn't screw anything up. I'm usually a pretty consistent squatter.

**545 lbs (247 kg)** - ooo - Moved slower than it should have, but I'd been stood in the wraps longer than I expected and hoped that if we timed it better next time and tightened the suit straps I'd be back to normal. Went to my planned 2nd.

**590 lbs (267 kg)** - xxx - Had to re-rack it as I somehow managed to get off center on the pick. No big deal. Picked it again and started my descent. Got off track ever so slightly and started tipping backwards slooowly like a tree falling. Couldn't correct it. Timbeerrrrr. Spotters caught me.

**590 lbs (267 kg)** - ooo - Bobbled it at the bottom and did a little butt wiggle that turned it into a grinder. All I remember about this lift is the world slowly going dark as I came back up. Pretty pleased to have gotten it in spite of my near-nap, but was a little miffed at myself for making what should've been fairly easy into a slog.

**Bench:**

If there was going to be a bomb out it'd be on bench. The window between ""not enough weight to touch"" and ""too much weight for me to lock out"" is pretty small for me. Was pretty confident I'd be fine, but other than getting at least one successful attempt in I didn't expect too much.

**340 lbs (154 kg)** - ooo - Felt about how I expected. Lot of pressure off of me here as I knew that barring a freak injury or something I'd be able to secure a total.

**360 lbs (163 kg)** - ooo - Felt heavy. Back on track for that 1500 total.

**370 lbs (167 kg)** - xxx - Probably my best descent of the lot and it popped off of my chest, but my elbows went wild and that was it. Honestly not sure I had this much in me on the day even if I kept my form in line, so not at all mad. 

**Deadlifts:**

Strength-wise my best lift. Maybe technique-wise too but I'm not really ready to brag about any of 'em in that department. The only problem here is I'm still not fully sure how I like my suit set for deadlifts. For squat it's ""absolutely mummify me as tightly as possible."" Simple enough. But I need the laces and straps a little looser on deads or I can't get into position. Joked with my handler that I'd know how I wanted the suit set after my 3rd attempt.

**490 lbs (222 kg)** - ooo - Felt like it moved slower than it should, but watching the video it seems about right. Had my handler tighten the laces.

**525 lbs (238 kg)** - ooo - Again, felt slow but video looks ok. Had my handler tighten the straps. Just needed to get my third to hit 1500 dead on.

**550 lbs (249 kg)** - ooo - Suit was perfect. Felt better than the first two. Always nice to end on a successful lift and I got the total I wanted.

**Total:** 1500 lbs (680.3886 kg according to the ol' interwebs converter), 468.18 DOTS.

**Final thoughts:**

Meet was well run by the folks from West Indy Barbell (host gym was Dedicated Health in Terre Haute). Got out by 16:00 from a meet that started at 10:00. Granted, there were only 30 people and 2 flights, but having sat through USPA meets that ran for 12 hours in the past it was nice to get done at a reasonable time. Judging was legit from what I saw. Spotters didn't let anyone die, though there was a close call on bench and I would have had the safeties up if it were me running the rodeo.

Was the only one in my class as is often the case so I came in first place (and last).

**For the future:**

Need to get bigger (I say this after every meet) and fill out my weight class. Also need some tighter briefs A) because I'm smaller on meet day and B) because I bought the current pair big to make the learning process easier. Obviously need to get stronger as well, but that's not news.","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background and Training**

5’6/30/M, this meet is lucky number 13 for me. Made some slight changes to some programming I wrote for myself, focusing on volume in the first half, and intensity in the 6 weeks leading into the meet. My best lifts prior to meet day was a 705lb squat double, a 475lb bench press double, and a 675lb deadlift single (admittedly, I was trying to double it, but it wasn’t quite there for me… deadlift has always been my lagging lift). My training weight for this prep stayed below 198 for the majority of the time, until it *mysteriously* jumped up about 10lbs in the last 4 weeks of prep. 

**Meet Prep**

Nothing strange about this prep versus previous preps I’ve posted. Kept the same overall structure, and tapered my lifts pretty perfectly, taking my heaviest lifts about a week and a half out from game day.

Shed the few pounds I was overweight by with a short water load/sauna cut, and easily made weight at the nearly perfect 89.9kg. Recomped that night up to 209 with some sushi and hibachi, my recomp staples.

Meet goals: Crack into the 1900s.

**The Lifts**

Videos: [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUi4XOqgEL0/)

8/9, nearly perfect day, with perfect attempt selections. I probably couldn’t have had a better meet than how I performed.

**Squat**

During warm-ups, I dun goofed and didn’t exactly time my warm-ups perfectly. Plus, the flights were small (9 lifters) and FAST. So I ended up swearing at my wraps as I tried to quickly roll my wraps, wrap my knees, take my last warm up of 615, re-roll my wraps, get to the back room, and re-wrap my knees for my opener, all with throbbing forearms from a massive pump.

672.4LB/305KG, make: Nothing to talk about here, it moved like an opener, 3 white lights. My saving grace: Brandon Franklin showed up, and helped me pull my wraps through, since I was unable to make a fist at that point… and I am completely appreciative that he helped me through the remainder of my squats. Awesome guy to have in your corner. Plus, I was using his wraps...

711LB/322.5KG, make: Small PR. There was some sort of computer glitch that held up the flight for an extra few minutes while I was wrapped, so by the time I reached the bar, my left foot was numb and my right foot was going. Finished the lift regardless, 2 white lights, and ended up stumbling AFTER the rack command. Yikes! But all things considered, I was extremely happy just getting the lift to count. 

733LB/332.5KG, make: Bar felt SUPER heavy, but I pushed that thought aside and trusted my body to do its thing. And it did! Squat went down, came back up. I think the attempt was perfect. Huge meet PR for me!

**Bench**

463LB/210KG, make: Found a guy to help with hand offs, and he did a fantastic job for it being only the first time he’s done them for me. Opener moved like an opener again.

485LB/220KG, make: Moved a little slower, but was manageable. However, I swallowed my ego and put in a third attempt that unfortunately did not allow me to bench 501 again. :( I think the right call was made, though.

496LB/225KG, make: Just shy of 500, but again, was the right call. Bar even stopped moving at one point, so I don’t think any attempt higher than what I put in was going to move.

Sub-total going into deads: 1229lbs.

**Deadlift**

644.8LB/292.5KG, make: Opener was fast, and this is where the fun began. Another competitor in my weight class decided to try to cut down to 181, but called it at 186. However, this meant that his Dots score was being inflated, and he had a real shot at being named Best Lifter as a result. He hit his opening deadlift of 725ish, which put his score within 10 points of mine.

678LB/307.5KG, make: A safe second attempt, this secured my 1900lb total, which was my biggest goal going into this meet. However, had I missed this attempt for any reason, my competitor would have overtaken me for the Best Lifter position, as he made his second attempt of 760. I entered the smallest increment possible for my third attempt, just to wait and see what he put in for his third. He had big plans, and entered 799lbs. And as such, I changed my final attempt to 700lbs, to fight for the win. 

700LB/317.5KG, miss: Womp womp. I missed. Got it to my knees, couldn’t lock it out. However, stuck around to watch my competitor go for his 799, and saw that he, too, missed his attempt, allowing me to secure the overall win. 

**Results**

Totaled 1907LB/865KG, going 8/9, and made a PR for squat and total. This placed me first in the Open Classic Raw 90kg weight class, best classic raw lifter, and best lifter overall. Got a whole bunch of goodies as a result, including things from Pioneer, Bearfoot, MTS, Kabuki, and a cash prize as well!

**My final thoughts:** a perfect meet for me. The meet director was someone I’ve worked with in the past, and he has ALWAYS put on a fantastic meet for the lifters. I don’t think anyone left the event unhappy.

Also, this was planned to be my last meet, ever. I am stepping away from competition to prioritize other things in life, including my health. In 6 years of competition, I have made a lot of friends and connections, experienced a lot of drama and headache, recorded State, National, and ‘federation’ World Records, bounced back from several major muscle tears, and repeatedly took insane risks every time I stepped under the barbell. I was able to travel and see parts of the globe that I never would have thought to experience, as a result of powerlifting. I am happy to end my powerlifting “career” on a high note, knowing that I gave everything I had, and put everything together nearly perfectly, for my last meet ever. It’s been a hell of a ride, and I loved every second of it.","powerlifting, fitness"
"The outdoors is my passion, right alongside powerlifting; however, ever since I started powerlifting back in 2019 it seems like those favorite outdoor activities are becoming more difficult (it band pain, knee pain, low back pain, etc.)

Does anyone have experience balancing their love of powerlifting while also balancing their love of movement in the outdoors? Or is it a case of choosing one or the other? 

I’d appreciate any input. Thank you!","powerlifting, fitness"
"The ""Power Meet"" is currently live over on loltyler1's twitch channel:

https://www.twitch.tv/loltyler1

I know this meet is a bit of a meme, but it's bringing powerlifting out to a wider audience, and let's be honest, there's not exactly an overflow of big events going on in powerlifting at the moment. 

Plus it is featuring at least some notable Powerlifters, like everyone's favourite uncle Ben Rice!

So let's join in on the fun, hype our favourite lifters in chat, and have this thread serve as everyone's one stop shop for discussion of the event.

Here's a rough table of competitors and their lifts I shamelessly stole from /u/goldsolace's comment in the initial announcement thread. Big props for taking the effort to make it.

**Let's go!**

Edit: Vod of the meet for anyone interested: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/993449589","powerlifting, fitness"
"My First meet on r/Powerlifting and hopefully ill get a nice little flair along with it, despite an interesting final week of prep.

SO BASICALLY, I focused on improving my squat, since I hadn't lifted through the second half of lockdown at all, and it was my favourite lift beforehand. 5 months ago I struggled with 170-180 and couldn't seem to relearn how to brace, as I had just started training again after a long lay-off. Flash back to 12 weeks of training, I did a mock meet and hit a 10kg PB of 210kg along with 135/220, fairly smoothly @ 85kg, so things were looking up. Ran a similar 8-9 week training cycle again and hit 220 for a cool third in competition at a lighter bodyweight. Still Buzzing.

Bench press was a royal cock-up, as I should have been conservative and taken a 135-137.5 in the meet, but jumped up to 140 because I got greedy. Was close because I failed it halfway, but there's no use in leaving kilos on the platform, so ill take smaller jumps next time.

In terms of deadlift, I got stronger, but had grip issues in my mock meet 9 weeks out where I couldn't hold onto 240 despite it moving fairly comfortably. Flash forward to meet time, I was feeling very confident in it for a second attempt, especially after SMOKING a 220 opener. I had done every single set in prep with a mixed grip, holding it further in my palm to prevent the bar from slipping (as I used to use a fingertip grip that was unreliable for me personally).

When it came time for a second deadlift, 240 moved extremely easy. And then my pec cramped.

\--------------------------------------------------------

What I should mention, is that I was planning on water cutting to 83 so that I could quite comfortably hit a QT for nationals, but had gotten ill a few days before, and was absolutely drained. I abandoned my water cut and STILL ended up dehydrated and more down in weight than I expected (because of the residual effects from a water cut combined with the effects of having a cold). So thats why im coming in at such an awkward bodyweight - I normally sit around 87-88 and am planning to just compete in the 93s next time.

\--------------------------------------------------------

My pec hurt so much that I thought I tore something, but checked ROM and it seemed to have no loss of function so I concluded it was fine, and tried again on my 3rd attempt. Hamstring Cramped halfway through the lift. I dropped the bar, did a weird hamstring jig whilst trying not to fall over, laughed, limped off the platform and sat down, confused at the end to the day, and slightly annoyed that my total got nerfed by being dehydrated. 

My hamstring still feels funny half a week later, but I can sort that out with some cheeky prehab. Thanks for reading!

tldr - 220/132.5/220 @ 84.2 some huge meet PRs, but very far from my best day :')","powerlifting, fitness"
"Finally got my first meet done and over with yesterday after having the one I planned to life in cancelled last March when the world fell apart. 

**Pre-meet**
I'm a big boy, so I've always planned on lifting in the 120+ division, so didn't really have any sort of plan to cut weight (despite my friendly neighborhood gym owner always asking me what my diet is, lol.) We were out of the gym for most of the year from April or so of 2020 until March 2021, but life stabilized enough at that point to get back into a reasonable enough state and we picked back up from there. Prior to 'Rona I had been playing around a little bit with some of the Sheiko templates, but after nearly a year out of the gym I decided to go back to my tried-and-true of 5/3/1 BBB which has given me some great results in the past. Since we restarted back in March, I've been able to make it into the gym 3-4 times a week despite a grueling work schedule and, honestly, poor quality sleep which comes with the territory of working in medicine. 

Didn't really have a specific plan coming into the meet aside from some openers which I'd tested about a week out from the meet -- figured I'd just wing it as far as attempt selection after openers.

**The meet**
Squats went really well, opened fairly conservatively at 565 and did a couple of big jumps up to third attempt at 621.5, smoked em' all and I think scared my spotters a little bit, 9/9 white lights.

Felt pretty good going into bench but made a bonehead move and jumped the start command for first attempt, still moved well though so went to 440 for second attempt, 3 white lights there. Was feeling overly ambitious and tried for 456.5 for third attempt and failed to lockout so ended up with just my second attempt counting.

Felt pretty great leading up to deadlift, not terribly fatigued and crushed first attempt at 638, went up to 682 for second attempt that felt great too (though looking back now I thank the generous judge that white lighted that lockout!) And then went to 700 for third attempt but didn't lockout well enough, 2 reds.

All in all, ended up at 282.5/200/310 or 621.5/440/682 and total 792.5/1743.5. Not quite enough for a qualifying totals for nationals but I'm still extremely pleased with my performance for my first meet!

"My 2nd meet ever and I was very excited to try and qualify for Canadian Nationals. A Master II 105kg qualifying total is 502.5kg and in my first meet 2 months ago in September I pulled 500kg with some beginner mistakes (locked knees/elbows anybody?) ;)

Only 2 flights in my time slot with 8 and 9 lifters respectively so it went by very quickly. In some cases I was handing in my attempt card, walking back in and back in the hole. I needed to hydrate more but didn't want to risk puking up a bunch of Gatorade on a big lift :)

Squats - original planned attempts were 180/190/200 but my left calf and right knee were giving me some issues so I decided to start at 175 and go from there

First lift (175kg) - no issues. Up like a starter should. 3 white lights

Second lift (185kg) - Had to grind a bit and my knee started to protest but the lift went up. 3 white lights

Third lift (190kg) - A grind but I may have been being a bit cautious. I think I had a bit more in me but glad I played it safe. Personal PR of 10lbs. 3 white lights

Bench - Original planned attempts were 115/125/130

First attempt (115kg) - Now my calves were starting to cramp so getting set was tough. I'm going to start setting my feet first for bench then getting my shoulders down. On the first lift my left foot slipped which is why it looks so awkward and an auto 'no lift'

Second attempt (120kg) - I knew strength wasn't the issue but didn't want to bomb out so settled on a 5kg jump. Was able to get setup better this time and it went up like it should. 3 white lights.

Third attempt (125kg) - My calves were finally cooperating and like the 2nd attempt my setup was better so the lift was a lot smoother. Except I rolled ever so slightly on my left foot so got one red light. Didn't get it on video but that's a meet PR

Deadlifts - Original planned attempts - 200/215/225

First attempt (200kg) - went up very smoothly and felt great. 3 white lights

Second attempt (215kg) - here's where the speed of the event started to play in. Other guys were making bigger jumps so it got in my head how quickly I had to lift again. Went up but it felt like a real grind. Still, 3 white lights and a meet PR

Third attempt (220kg) - No excuses - I lost my focus, didn't brace, and basically blew it. My biggest disappointment of the night for sure.

But a 530kg total is a meet PR and qualifies me for Canadian Nationals. Overall, I was pretty happy, especially as this was only my 2nd meet. Placed 2nd of three competitors too. Was nice to have other people to compete against this time and everybody was ultra supportive of each other!

"Hi everyone, this is my first ""meet report"" on the subreddit, so forgive me if I break convention or screw something up. My goal is to describe how the meet generally went, some fun observations about notable performances and then how I got to the meet with prep and how I felt about what I did. I also meant to be more concise, but that did not happen.

This was my second meet, and first in a while after having a few cancelled due to COVID. In the interim, I convinced my brother-in-law to compete and this was his first meet. So while I was very much focused on doing well, I definitely wanted him to have a good time too. We'll see if he notices this post.

**Programming/Training**

For about the last 5 years, I've trained in my garage for convenience's sake. That really seemed prescient after COVID hit, but it also affects some of my programming thoughts and training by one's self means few chances for form examination. For my first meet, I was basically following a version of Starting Strength that fit my schedule, then tapered for the meet. After that I tried Barbell Medicine's Strength I template, but it really wore me out, likely because I struggle with accurately judging RPE. After that, I found the Juggernaut Powerlifting Program Design Manual and worked with that. The Juggernaut thought process worked well for me, and I plan to continue with it in the future. The downside is that my form for each lift went off at one point or another. Squats were fixed by a Barbell Medicine video form check (HIGHLY recommended if you're like me, in this case the bar was too high on my back and my weight was too far back on my heels....a bad combination). Bench was fixed by fiddling with grip width after an intense session left my triceps and front delts super sore, but pecs were fine. Also, I had to learn a good place for my feet. And deadlifts were fixed after I realized that my weight was too far back (I couldn't pull 495 that way...moved weight forward and then pulled 520 the next week). So I went into the meet a bit unsure about how it would go, but somewhat confident that I'd hit my goals.

**Goals**

After my last meet (527.5 kilos at 108 ish kilo bodyweight), I got stronger for a while, but also heavier. Turns out I was weighing around 250 lbs, and I wasn't a fan. So I looked at my diet (I can get into more detail, but I don't think it's that interesting) and started to lose weight. That started around the end of September. My goal there was to lift in the 105 kilo weight class (so 231 lbs if my math works). I ended up settling around 225 lbs in clothes about a month out before the meet and weighed in at the 97.8 kilos in the subject post. In retrospect, I should have eaten lunch (noon weigh in) and weighed in a bit heavier. But I wanted to do a 2x bodyweight squat (or 200 kilos, based on expected weight), 300 lb bench and 500+ lbs on my deadlift. I was 1/3 on those goals, but if you add ""having fun"" and ""making sure that my BIL also had a good meet"" as goals, that was 3/5.

**Meet Day**

*Squat -* I was feeling quite frenzied during warmups, and it seemed like the judging was going to be quite strict, so I started off quite uneasy. Hit my opener at 175 (I like opening really really low on squat for that exact reason). Then made my planned jump to 190. My BIL missed his first squat by really really trying to hit depth and nearly sitting down. He got his second attempt in, which helped both of us settle down. I mean, my hands were shaking so badly that I couldn't cap the pen after putting in my second attempt. I then went out and hit my 190 without much issue, so I made my big jump to 200 kilos. It felt fine until I hit my sticking point and it just stopped. Oh well. The spotters did a good job though and were great at encouraging all of us.

*Bench -* Opened at 125 and had some really long waits for the start and pause commands. Happily, the bar still moved really well. I had hit 295 lbs in training, so my next jump was to 132.5 kilos. That had faster commands (I guess I looked more stable) and also went up quite well, so I made my bold call to 137.5 to get that 300 lb goal. That one, much like my squat, hit a sticking point and that was it. Not going to lie, missing two third attempts didn't feel great, and made me want to be a bit more conservative for deadlifts. (I'd like to pretend that some combination of the mask wearing/warmer gym area than my garage was the root cause, but I prepared for mask wearing and just wasn't strong enough.)

*Deadlift -* I opened at 215 and even though my warmups felt awfully mediocre, this attempt went up really smoothly. That had me feeling good again, as well as the general relaxation from hitting a total. So I went to 227.5 for my 500 lbs and that also went up quite well. Instead of pushing a bit, I decided that I'd try my ""conservative"" 3rd attempt at 235 kilo, since I had gotten a grindy 520 lbs in the gym. The 235 went up slowly but surely and I finally had a completed 3rd attempt and my full total.

Thinking about it now, I either got 3 white lights or just didn't complete the lift. So that's something.

**General Meet Commentary**

This meet was run by Calloso LLC and it was extremely well organized. Huge fan and will try to lift in their meets in the future. The gym was quite well set up for the meet, but only had 4 warm up stations. It worked, but 1 or 2 more stations would have gone a long way to making things easier with some of the disparities in strength in my session/flight. (Translation....when Angelo Fortino is warming up, no one at this meet is really working in at those weights. So that area is dead to us. Not his fault for the weights he was lifting, but I wish that he had someone to strip off weight when he was done and/or let people warm up in the same area. Incidentally, he was understandably focused, but still volunteered to chalk my BILs back, since I had never done that before and was crumbling chalk everywhere.)

It was neat to see some records fall at the meet. Angelo will get the headlines (and my awkward looking self is in the background of the video that was posted here), but it was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME to see a 70 year old lifter, at his first meet, set a state bench record after watching a 9 year old girl do a full meet as well. And that ignores the 50s and 60s lifters, both male and female, that were lifting. Makes me happy to be part of the sport.

Some other miscellaneous positives. There were lots of first time lifters, and I think that they had a good meet. Nearly everyone was really friendly and outgoing, especially after the first round of squat nerves came out of the system. I have to say that it was a treat to chat with the winner of my weight class (I'll leave names out for the very mild privacy that it might provide), who was super friendly as he was flying past my ""future goal total"". Also, he had a coach who was also handling a few other lifters (affiliated with Power and Performance...and I think he's the only coach). He was fantastic to chat with and coordinate with for warmups and such. I live nowhere near the meet and his usual coaching area, but am still thinking about contacting him for coaching/meet handling.

Thus concludes my brick of text and I'd be happy to respond to whatever people might be curious about. Thanks for reading.","powerlifting, fitness"

I enjoyed this program a lot. especially week 2 squats lol. found out my lower body strength increased a lot but my bench stayed the same. I hit 80 for a single during training but I failed it on the day of testing

the deadlift increased a lot because I found out I was deficit deadlifting the whole time as my 20kg plates were 39cm instead of 45. the ones I hit 160 on were 48cm so slightly bigger than they should've been, i'll use 160 for my 1rm in the next program as I'm pretty sure i'd have the strength.

ill probably run this program again one day but I'm going to run deadlift specialization v2 by Jamal browner. physically I don't feel bigger as I've kinda skipped most other than accessories the sbd ones. as gyms were closed and lost a lot of motivation so I did enough to get by. my goals for before I turn 16 is 1234 plate club and then 2021 goal is 1000lb total which I think I can do. during the program, I took extra rest because school is tiring.

pretty sure bench didn't move as it was too much volume/fatiguing of me to handle. on the program, I plan to do it as it builds slowly and is only bench 3x a week","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background & Meet Prep**

I'm 34 and have been focusing on powerlifting and lifting consistently for about two years. This was my 3rd meet, and first meet with a coach. Working with a coach, expecially in person, made a huge difference. The cues and immediate corrections he was able to make on the fly helped my squat and deadlift immensely. He was also far less conservative in his programming than I am and took fewer and heavier dealoads than I normally would. This worked really well for me, and I'm glad I gave it a shot.

Lots of heavyish wrapped singles starting 10 weeks out, but I think a lot of that had to do with correcting my dogshit technique and teaching me how to effectively use wraps.

Hit a 9.5 bench single every week the entire prep 

Deadlifts ended up not getting peaked because I hurt myself about 5 weeks out and couldn't really get in position and we didn't think it was worth injuring myself further and not being able to squat or bench.

**The Lifts**

7/10, missed final bench and final deadlift. Finished with 700kg total, 50kg meet pr (previous pr was w/ sleeves)

**Squat**

[Final Squat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RsxLlvYTsmSxZwBdDPm79SIBIJJ4Uk8/view?usp=sharing)

**265kg/584lbs**, 2WL - Got under the bar, started to brace and realized I forgot to tighten my belt. Lift still moved like an opener

**280kg/617lbs**, 3WL - 5kg more than I have ever squatted before, felt about the same as 265kg

**[295kg/650lbs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RsxLlvYTsmSxZwBdDPm79SIBIJJ4Uk8/view?usp=sharing)**, 2WL - 20kg heavier than I squatted in training and a 45kg meet pr. This one felt heavy and moved pretty slow, might have had another 5kg but I'm happy with coach's call.

**Bench**

[2nd Bench](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XdRGj6N-TesOPrCv3IHVzcmc2UcsE587/view?usp=sharing)

**160kg/350lbs**, 3WL - 5kg meet pr moved like an opener

**[165kg/363lbs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XdRGj6N-TesOPrCv3IHVzcmc2UcsE587/view?usp=sharing)**, 3WL - Not too hard but my back started locking up a little at lock out.

**170kg/375lbs**, 0WL - We decided if the lift was going to be a grind I should just drop it back to my chest instead of potentially ruining my back before deadlifts. Came off my chest fast but started to slow down pretty significantly a good bit before lockout so I just brought it back down.

**Deadlift**

[2nd Deadlift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvFcMIQomMWd9E1mftay8TicoMpV34Xy/view?usp=sharing)

[Final Deadlift](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXjTPUHJp8jjLe-zS3mC64mc5FKtXyrj/view?usp=sharing)

**230kg/507lbs**, 3WL - Opened pretty conservative because I had pulled a grand total of about 8 deadlifts in the last month and most of them sucked. Lift was super easy

**[240kg/529lbs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvFcMIQomMWd9E1mftay8TicoMpV34Xy/view?usp=sharing)**, 3WL - Stayed conservative because I wanted to ensure I hit a 700kg total. Lift moved fine

**[260kg/573lbs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PXjTPUHJp8jjLe-zS3mC64mc5FKtXyrj/view?usp=sharing)**, 1WL - 720kg is an 'elite' total in the USPA & my goal for the meet, so we took a pretty big jump. It was a grinder and I was redlighted by the side judges for ramping.

**Final Thoughts**

This is the 1st meet I've ever been satisfied with my performance at the end of. The final deadlift call was kind of a bummer but I really just need to learn how to not suck at deadlifting. USPA TX always puts on good meets, but they really out-did themselves this time. The venue was awesome, the warmup room was filled with ghost racks, kabuki bars, and callibrated plates, and the entire meet moved quickly and efficently.

Hiring Blake Lehew as my coach is one of the best lifting decisions I've made. He is a master technician and wonderful at breaking down and explaining things. His experience help and insight also made moving through the meet way more enjoyable than my previous meets. I'm not sure if he takes online clients, but if you're in the San Antonio you should definitely look him up.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Have we heard any official word on if the USAPL national winners are going to be competing at World's? Listening to 2WL interview of Russ made me think about this, Google was no help, and I'm not on insta. 

Also, any word on the roster for the USA? Obviously Atwood at 74, Russ at 83, but what about 93 and 105s? Assuming Cayco at 93, but I remember hearing Ashton is competing at the Showdown, so Bryce in his place?","powerlifting, fitness"
"Edit: here’s a link to the full meet if you want to see some of the monsters that were there. One woman squatted 500lbs I believe. Twitch.Tv/Squat2Depth

I’m going to try not to drone on too long, I’ve got a lot to say about this first experience so bare with me. Lol.

Background and Training
I did a little bit of lifting in high school in my strength and conditioning class so I started out sort of knowing the basic lifts besides deadlift because we only used a hex bar. Other than that I just started powerlifting as an adult (I’m 27 now)about 10 months out from this meet.  I do not have a coach. I’ve been using a couple different programs by John Meadows for my training: Program X, Unity 2.0, Gammabomb. I also discovered Jim Wender’s 5-3-1 about 4 months out from the meet and used that up until about 2 weeks out and really liked it. This was my first meet ever. I decided against everyone’s advice that I wanted to cut weight. I went from 143 to 130. I used Alex Bromley’s water loading method and didn’t eat two days out from weigh in, and didn’t eat or drink anything 1 day out and up until weigh in besides maybe a shot glass of water with ibuprofen because I was in a great deal of pain near the end of it. This was absolutely brutal and I probably won’t do it again. However I don’t think that this was the direct cause of my demise but might have affected performance a bit. It was a 24 hour weigh in so I did get a bit of time to recover. At weigh-ins a lot of my gear wasn’t approved which wasn’t super devastating to me because it was all stuff I could go without if I had to, I was just happy to be able to do this, lol. So my belt, undershirt, wrist-wraps, and elbow sleeves were all no-gos. I would’ve liked to have had my belt for squat but I don’t even use one for deadlift anyways so it was ok. We had to drive 4 hours to get to Southbend so we stayed in a nearby hotel the night before the meet. I felt like this caused a bit of stress for me just because I would’ve rather had my own bed and all my stuff in one place. We also for lack of having a sitter had to bring our 2 year old son to the meet, so that was also a little stressful,lol. 

Meet Day 
I absolutely loved this gym and the people running this meet. Everyone was absolutley amazing. So supportive and helpful. I loved being able to meet other lifters and the refs, etc. Everyone had words of encouragement. People were hugging me after lifts; good or bad. I was really feeling the love here. It made me love the sport even more getting to witness how amazing the lifting community really is instead of just reading about it. I met so many great people. There were a ton of outstanding athletes at this meet and a SHIT TON of state records were broken. The entire meet had a great vibe and everything was so hype. This meet was so awesome that I was able to convince my husband AND my best friend to sign up for their first meet! Everything ran so smoothly and it only lasted 5 hours which was good for me because my little one had about had it by that time, he was an angel the entire time though. It was really interesting changing diapers between squat and bench. Lol. I had a ton of nerves going into this but I was definitely lucky to have this as my first meet because I couldn’t have been set up better, even though I still screwed up pretty much everything besides deadlift. So anyways, let’s get to my lifts. I’m going to include the links to videos of my attempts if you feel like seeing me do dumb shit. Lol. 

Squat
I opened way too high and realized this after warming up, tried to run up and change it last minute but alas, it was too late. 🥺 Normally this weight was relatively easy for me but that was not the case on this day. 
1st Attempt - 102.5kg/226 - Failed miserably 



[squat fail 1](https://imgur.com/a/hf2isKJ)

2nd Attempt - 102.5kg/226lbs - failed again!
[squat fail 2](https://imgur.com/a/psr96NW)
At this point the lady ref took me to the side and said I want you to get this, don’t go as deep etc and gave me a lot of encouragement. She really saved me here. 

3rd Attempt - Same weight 
3 white lights by the grace of god. 
[squat 3rd attempt](https://imgur.com/a/1tkflw9)

Bench
So after opening way too high on squat I immediately changed my first attempt from 175lbs to 155. I knew I could get 155 in my sleep and that’s what the opener should actually be as I learned the hard way. 

1st Attempt - 70kg/154lbs - 3 Red Lights
I got it easily but got called on pressing too soon. No lift.
[bench 1st attempt](https://imgur.com/a/SPTQOSP)

2nd Attempt - 80kg/176lbs - 3 Red Lights
Again, didn’t follow the commands and immediately racked it. 🙄 

[bench 2nd attempt](https://imgur.com/a/qJ3lPge)

3rd Attempt - 80kg/176lbs -3 Reds
Got gassed and just straight up failed this one 

[bench attempt 3](https://imgur.com/a/tzyPXOh)
It sucked bombing out of bench bc that’s what I’m actually good at lol so I was pretty devastated. I sucked it up and didn’t cry though so yay me.

Deadlift
I did it anyways even though I knew I wouldn’t get a total. It was a lot of fun so I’m glad I didn’t quit after bench. 

1st Attempt -125kg/275lbs - 3 white lights , felt super light

[deadlift 1st attempt](https://imgur.com/a/WinCmsy)

2nd Attempt -132.5kg/292.5lbs - 3 whites , went up effortlessly 

[deadlift 2nd attempt](https://imgur.com/a/qLqbn6k)

3rd Attempt -142.5kg/314lbs -3 whites
20lb PR for me! It was a silver lining. It went up so easy I wished I had tried for even more. The hype was great.

Ended up going 4/9 but I learned a lot and had a great time. Officially hooked and can’t wait to get back on the platform.","powerlifting, fitness"

M25 competed as a 181er.

Had my best meet to date at my most enjoyable meet to date. 

Squats - 407/429/451 (11lb meet/ATPR)

Bench - 275/292/303 (matched my best bench)

Deadlifts - 474/479/529 (11 lb meet PR, 6 lb ATPR)

Total - 1284 (33 lb meet PR from May) and got my first 9 for 9 meet.

I absolutely felt great on meet day. I have been using the offseason and peaking programs from Strengthlete Collective and I feel that I made great progress since my last meet in late July. I cropped up some serious shoulder pain before even starting my peak; I just woke up one day and had a lot of pain deep in the joint. That said I was conservative and went on the defensive on bench while peaking, and had even planned on going lighter for a third, but all the rest paid off and I was happy to just match my best. 

Squats were great, I think I had even more in the tank but 451 was my goal so that was the best call. 

Now on deadlifts... I told the table 507 for my second, but when I came out to pull I was very confused to see 479 loaded since I know kilo plate math well enough to know what 507lb should look like. My best guess is either they gave me someone else's attempt or they didn't input it correctly resulting in the smallest increment jump. Either way I wanted 529 too badly to not go full send with a 50lb jump. It was hard but felt pretty good all things considered.

Didn't place, didn't plan to, I just went and had fun and put up some nice PRs. It was also nice that the meet only lasted about 5-1/2 hours for 7 flights split between two platforms.

I would definitely recommend the peaking and offseason programs from TSC and John Haack if you want some simple but effective programming.","powerlifting, fitness"
"TLDR: Catastrophic squats, better than expected bench and ok deadlift with a little surprise. Totalled 527,5 and won my class. Was an ok meet on my part. Perfectly run and awesome people all around. You can check out the whole meet on my [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuVx-UpQER/) ^(shameless plug :\^))

&#x200B;

* **Background/Leading up to the meet**

&#x200B;

I used Sheiko Gold leading up the meet...with a lot of alterations and bastardizations. I don't think I am qualified to write a review on it to be honest, but I will still use the app moving forward, at least in some capacity.

This was my first meet in the 74KG weightclass after cutting from 95KG at the start of the first lockdown. I lost some strength, especially on squats because injury+losing weight+tons of hiking and walking with my dad is not the best combo for that I suppose. Bench and deadlift, actually totally content with them, but I expected more from deads.

This meet was held in the Power House gym in Mayrwies, Salzburg. I woke up at 5AM to catch a train to Vienna to link up with one of my clubmates. Had a little sleep for an hour in the car because I didn't sleep so well the night before because of some normal pre-meet excitement/jitteriness, and it hit the spot. Felt better after that. Arrived early, was the second one to weigh in from all the men. 73,5KG with some water and a shake in me without a watercut, so no biggie. Downed two Monsters, ate some ricewaffles and a banana and started warming up an hour after weigh ins. Really relaxed and slow. I think I handled every warmup pretty well except deadlifts, for which I clocked in at 11 minutes after warming up until my first pull. Oh well.

&#x200B;

* **The lifts**

&#x200B;

* Squat

1. Opener-152,5. Flew, nothing to say here. Perfect.
2. Second-162,5. Honestly, same as above.
3. Third-175. Gassed out or something, just wasn't there. Very disappointing, but what did I expect after months and months of not low bar squatting because of an injury, and cutting at the same time? This off season will be dedicated to growing some big juicy quads and glutes, because things are finally feeling good again as far as pain in my adductor. Really happy it cleared up like a month ago.

&#x200B;

* Bench

1. Opener-125. Lightning speed.
2. Second-132,5. Nice and stable.
3. Third-140. Up to this point, I got very generous press commands even though I told the head judge to please only give it to me AFTER I sunk it into my chest to the end point so I didn't get a red for heaving. The last two attempts were legit with all white lights, but the last was on a razor's edge as far as that goes. I got it, it got whitelighted with one red, so I'm happy.

&#x200B;

* Deadlift

1. Opener-215. Kinda iffy, kinda felt good at the same time. Slow but steady.
2. Second-225. Yeah, gotta be up there with some of the best grinders of my life. Matched my meet PR at 93KG so I'm happy with that. Think it's also some kind of record in the 74KG in Salzburg or something. Nothing to write home about but oh well, at least I got it. And then I blacked out and fell backwards lol
3. Third-230. Stuck on the floor. Just had to try. Failed. But it's all good.

&#x200B;

Total ended up at 527,5 and I got first place in the weightclass. Even the total was some sort of record, but again, I am not good with specifics.

&#x200B;

* **Closing word/Personal feelings/Wrap-Up**

&#x200B;

Overall pretty mixed feelings with how everything went, but I'm very thankful to my buddies, the people that organized the whole thing and lastly my family that always supported me.

Into the off season to fix some glaring weaknesses with my squat, and get down more solid pauses with my bench. So the focus areas will be; quads, glutes and chest and to generally go up in weight again while staying in range to cut down with a watercut for the 74KG weightclass.

Thanks so much for reading and have a good one!","powerlifting, fitness"
"On Saturday I competed in my first official meet and nationals. Before this, I was following free powerlifting programs, but for the last 4 weeks, I've been working with a coach, and it is soo worth it.

I'm 21 years old, so my main goal was to win the Junior category, but also got a great result in Open. Went 9/9, all white lights. Hit PR's in every lift, except for bench (but it was a meet PR lol).

Link to my Instagram post with the lifts:  [https://www.instagram.com/p/CQl0Cesrme1/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQl0Cesrme1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) (I would appreciate some new followers haha, mostly post in English except for this)

My bodyweight was moving around 83-84 kgs, so I didn't really have to cut weight.  All I did, was eating liquid meals the afternoon before meet day. Summer is really hot here, so I was in a constant sauna, and by the time I got to the comp, I sweated out like 1kgs lol.

Squats (200kgs / 440lbs) went great, goal was 195-200kg. First attempt was 180kgs, second 190kgs, all went really well. The week before comp I hit 192,5kgs, and the third attempt 200kg was pretty easy compared to it, so it's really good data for training and peaking.

For bench (137,5kgs / 303lbs), the goal was 137,5-140kg, and I already hit 140 in training twice. Opener was 130, then 135, and for third we went with 137,5, what turned out to be a good call, because I got some unreasonably long start and press commands.

Deadlift (260 kgs / 573lbs) is my special lift, and it showed. First attempt with 235kgs flew, first place was secured. Second with 250kgs was no problem either, so I wanted something big. For third I went with 260 kgs, honestly should have chosen 262,5 for the 600 total, but it's ok.

Overall I'm more than happy with this performance, can't wait for my next meet, big things are coming.","powerlifting, fitness"
"My first meet!

TL;DR: 8/9 - Deadlift PB - Had fun

Iron Inititative is for first & second time competitors only. Warcat ran a great meet - on time, good equipment, live stream, great community vibe. Could not have asked for a better meet for my first time on the platform!

**BACKGROUND**

Going in to this, I had no idea what I was in for. Decided just before my 45th birthday I was going to do a meet even though I’d never set foot in a powerlifting gym. All I knew was I loved deadlifting, my squat was passable & that I could learn how to bench. It gave me something to work towards & helped my focus to get through the crap sessions. Training for a reason makes a huge difference. 

My trainer programmed a lot of hypertrophy work with one day each of squat, bench & deadlift. Three months out we started specific meet training. I convinced him to compete with me so it was really good to go through it together. 

I train alone in my garage with no spotters & very basic squat stands via FaceTime with my trainer. I’m glad he didn’t have to watch me get stapled by a barbell via video call. That would have sucked. Did mean I held back a lot on my lifts because I wasn’t confident. 

My first 3 weeks of prep I was squatting to a box one day & full squat another (my knees suck). I convinced myself that I couldn’t squat more than 50kg / 110# & it was a huge mental hurdle to get over. Bench was flying (noob gains) but I had no idea how to use leg drive. That miraculously came in about week 8. Deadlifts were technically getting better but the numbers weren’t coming as fast as I wanted. I was unprepared for how much meet prep would leave me feeling beat up before deload. The mental aspects of pushing through when it felt hard are one of the things I’m most proud of myself for. 

**MEET DAY**

Squats are still my nemesis & I almost had a panic attack before my first attempt. I’m autistic & I had to really fight to stay calm with all the noise, people & lights. Kept it together & didn’t throw up. 

Attempt 1: 60kg / 132# 🔴⚪️⚪️
Attempt 2: 65kg / 143# 🔴⚪️🔴
Attempt 3: 67.5kg / 148# ⚪️⚪️⚪️ 

Bench was nerve wracking & we deliberately kept my attempts well under my training max of 56kg. 

Attempt 1: 47.5kg / 104# ⚪️⚪️⚪️
Attempt 2: 50kg / 110# ⚪️⚪️⚪️
Attempt 3: 52.5kg / 115# ⚪️⚪️⚪️

Deadlifts. Deadlifts are my favourite. I loved this part of the meet. Once I got my first attempt done & knew I had a total I finally relaxed. I was finally having fun. It turns out I feed off hype. 

Attempt 1: 107.5kg / 237# ⚪️⚪️⚪️
Attempt 2: 112.5kg / 248# ⚪️⚪️⚪️ PB
Attempt 3: 117.5kg / 259# ⚪️⚪️⚪️ PB

The last deadlift was the heaviest weight I have ever lifted in my life & it felt like a warmup. I am gonna hit 125kg & get those red plate feels in the very near future!

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I competed in Raw Masters 1B so was guaranteed a win if I could total. Really reinforced that “you’re really only competing against yourself”. 

My total is tiny (just over 2x my body weight) but it is mine & I earned it. I am proud of it. Don’t ever think your total is too low to compete. It isn’t. If you’re trying your best, people get behind you. 

Speaking of which, this sub has been so supportive of me & I really appreciate it.

Now I’m going to rest (I’ve got a killer head cold) & get back into another block of hypertrophy. Throwing some cardio in to get my body weight down. Plan to do my second meet next year (hopefully Iron Inititiative again). Looking at options for a powerlifting gym so I can push harder in a
safer environment than my garage setup.

**Meet Prep**

I was coached by Chance Cianciola out of Everyday Athletes in Louisville, KY, as I have been for nearly 2 years. The programs he has me on are nothing particularly crazy, kind of a GZCL type tiered program with main lift > direct variation > accessories, with light cardio on off days. I've responded well to it, and he does a great job of readjusting to accommodate aches and pains. Highly recommended if you're in the Louisville area. Prep had gone extremely well, notably for squat and bench. I broke through plateaus with both this training cycle, just with pure consistency and long term work. 

**Meet Day**

I weighed in at 112.5kg and declined to cut any weight because weight cuts are dumb.

**Squats**

Opener - 255kg/562.1lbs - Felt like an opener, which was exciting as that matched my meet PR. GOOD LIFT

2nd - 272.5kg/600.7lbs - Felt great unracking and on descent, about halfway up I felt my hip flexor tighten up and I had to muscle the weight up. I had hit this in training much easier, but hitting a 600 comp squat was my goal for the day, so I took it. GOOD LIFT and a 40lb meet PR

Given how tough it ended up being I skipped my third attempt and my coach and worked to loosed up my hip, and I was feeling great after 15 or 20 minutes. 


**Bench Press**

Opener - 182.5kg/402.3lbs - I was thrilled to hit this, it was a 15lbs meet PR and I had finally got broke the 400lb barrier after **five** attempts. GOOD LIFT

2nd - 190kg/418.8lbs - This was a fight. I slightly misgrooved coming off my chest, but was able to salvage it for three whites. Felt heavy as a hell, and my hip once again started to bother me, but GOOD LIFT and a 33lb meet PR

Just like on squats, I skipped my third attempt, hoping for more time to get my hip right ahead of deadlifts. Very happy with my numbers thus far. 


**Deadlift**

Opener - 265kg/584.2lbs - I was expecting a grind based on how I was feeling at that point, but it went up okay enough GOOD LIFT

2nd - 277.5kg/611.7lbs - This sucked. I had pulled 618 several times over the past year, and couldn't get 611 past my knees today. Hugh disappointment that cost me 1st place in the 272s. 

**Recap**

I finished with a 727.5kg/1603lbs total for a 40lb total PR, which I'm pretty happy with. My three main goals for this meet were a 600 squat, a 400 bench, and a 1600 total, but I definitely feel like I left a lot of deadlift pounds out there. 

Can't speak highly enough of the meet ran by Eric Freeman,  Garrett Fear, and USPA Kentucky. 100 lifters on 2 platforms in separate buildings, and everything went smooth as hell","powerlifting, fitness"

"**TLDR**: Competed for the first time. Had a damn blast and smashed my goals of 1000 lbs total and going 9/9. 

**Background**

My story is fairly straightforward. High school football made me really enjoy weight training. After that, I lifted on and off to stay in shape, but had no place to workout when not at school. I started having consistent gym access last July when I splurged for a home gym. Started powerlifting-specific training last fall. Decided to sign up for the first USAPL meet that was available in my state at the beginning of the year. 

**Meet Prep**

I ran Calgary Barbell's 8 week program to peak for this meet. The timeline was a little off, so I had to repeat the third week of the program. I also committed a cardinal sin: I cut weight for my first competition. Don't worry, I didn't fool with a water cut, I just dropped about ten lbs via diet over my meet prep. Holiday food made me gain 10 lbs in the 6 weeks I ran Candito Intermediate before this, and I wanted to get back to my usual 180ish weight anyway

**Meet Day**

I weighed in at 81.4 kg, which was a relief as it meant my scale at home wasn't lying to me. I was really unsure about what the adjustment to competition-spec equipment would be like, but I think it went well. Each individual attempt is linked.

**Squats**

[Opener](https://streamable.com/4ip0do) \- 160kg/352.7lbs - For some reason, this one felt the worst out of all of my squat attempts. During my taper, my squat didn't feel great, so I opened 10 lbs below my previous gym PR of 365 lbs. Since this one didn't feel great either, I only made a 5 kilo jump (tried to change it after being told that it moved pretty well but I couldn't). GOOD LIFT

[2nd Attempt](https://streamable.com/w08skk) \- 165kg/363.7lbs - This one really flew up. I was told ""put some weight on the bar"". I'm starting to think I may be overestimating my RPE's when doing singles in my programming. GOOD LIFT

[3rd attempt](https://streamable.com/x1578j) \- 180 kg/396.8 lbs - Maybe an ambitious jump, but it felt great and more or less matched my lifetime PR for squats from when I was an athlete. I think I got one red light maybe because I was close to jumping the rack command? But regardless, GOOD LIFT. 

&#x200B;

**Bench Press**

[Opener](https://streamable.com/iukv1p) \- 97.5 kg/210 lbs - I went really conservative on bench press because I didn't know if it was going to be more difficult to get my short ass into a good position on a comp bench. I was used to a  shorter bench at my campus gym. Turned out to be a pretty easy adjustment however, and the extra grip was nice. For some reason though, getting myself into position was kind of painful on the middle of my back throughout my bench attempts. Felt fine afterwards. Opener flew. GOOD LIFT

 [2nd attempt](https://streamable.com/dtm6qp) \- 105 kg/231.4 lbs - Again, very smooth. I decided I'd be able to go for an eight lb PR on my third. GOOD LIFT

[3rd Attempt](https://streamable.com/66qok7) \- 112.5 kg/248 lbs - A bit slow going up, but I locked it out. I think my attempt selection was probably best for my bench press. Probably had a decent amount left in the tank on my other two lifts. GOOD LIFT

**Deadlift**

[Opener](https://streamable.com/t380mg) \- 170 kg/374.8 lbs - Opened fairly conservative, as I had made the switch to pulling sumo this last training block. I was a bit worried about grip, but it turned out that a competition bar and being able to use actual chalk instead of liquid chalk was more than enough to make it zero issue. GOOD LIFT

[2nd Attempt](https://streamable.com/fb0p49) \- 180 kg/396.8 lbs - Felt good. Not too much else to say. Again, I made a really big jump, but there was a lot of uncertainty so I felt that I just lowballed my opener. GOOD LIFT

[3rd Attempt](https://streamable.com/ulqw96) \- 195 kg/429.9 lbs - This felt pretty good. I might have left some kilos on the platform, but I was just happy that my deadlift wasn't only 10 lbs more than my squat. GOOD LIFT

**Recap**

I came in with the goal of totaling 1000 lbs and going 9 for 9. My gym total was 980 10 weeks ago, so I felt it was a pretty realistic goal. However, I was surprised about how well every lift went. My bench press in particular was a great improvement IMO. I went from 240 with probably zero pause @ RPE 11 to 248 competition paused. The competition experience was great too. I had heard it would be a supportive environment, but I was blown away by how much everyone was rooting for each other. Hopefully I'll continue to get stronger and can participate in some state level comps. I think I'm hooked.","powerlifting, fitness"

I saw that u/achy_breaky_joints has been offering to [expand the number of people who he works with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/q8ulqa/powerlifting_coaching/), so I figured I would do everyone a favour and recommend him to anyone casting around for a coach. I know he is pretty active giving advice around here, while I am not, but I think this may be a more receptive audience than where he originally posted.

This was in no way prompted by him, and I should probably have checked with him before sharing all the details below. Hope I don't get fired as a trainee.

&#x200B;

**My Background**

36M with a business, a 3yo kid, and a beat up body from rugby with multiple knee and shoulder surgeries.

Haven’t competed yet.I live in Spain and was originally targeting a meet next March, but now because life, likely first meet will be in Italy in summer.

Training age is coming up on 2 years, though I spent 3 or 4 months during first lockdown without access to a gym, and was originally in a non-PL friendly commercial place for 3 months.

Was a ""reasonable"" athlete in school and university (played rugby to a competitive level). Never took lifting seriously, besides aimless bro split stuff. Hardly lifted at all from 2008 onward, and never trained for strength until end of 2019. 

Started with some online template programming until lockdown in March 2020. Moved that summer, I got a rack and a bar, continued with templates. Ran J&T2.0 with good success on a first run, then blew up on second run (made zero progress) and realised my technique was just non existent. 

**Working with** u/achy_breaky_joints **since December 2020.**

&#x200B;

**About** u/achy_breaky_joints

First thing to say is just that he’s a great dude. He is incredibly helpful and committed, and has become a good friend. 

So I am not going to even pretend that this is going to be an unbiased review. Personalised coaching is about a personal relationship, so if you want unbiased, I honestly think you’re probably looking at it wrong. 

If you want to get a sense for who he is, I would look through some of his comment history. The guy just loves helping people out, especially around powerlifting. I won’t psychoanalyse him, but it’s clear that helping people to improve motivates him, and I have felt the benefit of a lot of his personal investment of time and energy in this process. When I say investment, I mean it. He gives a shit, and I genuinely feel bad if I don’t take his advice onboard effectively. That might be terrible for some, but it helps me stay on track and keep accountable.

He personally trains and competes out of a serious PL gym with quality athletes many of whom are competitive at nats level and above, and I know he spends a lot of his free time handling at meets, and generally hyping and helping. He loves the sport.

&#x200B;

**Weirdness in my setup**

I train at home, alone, in the middle of nowhere in Spain, with a bunch of janky equipment. Couldn’t be further removed from his environment. 

&#x200B;

**How it has worked**

I won’t go into detail about specific programming.

But the format is super organised and very much a two-way street. 

We set goals and long term targets at the outset, as well as discussing life constraints, and everything else that should be considered in terms of health. Then we worked back from there in terms of meso, block and cycle construction.

Every block is around 4 weeks and is programmed after 1hr+ check ins via Skype at the end of the block. 

These checkins involve video review and a detailed discussion of everything relevant: nutrition, rest, life factors, any new equipment I have bought and that we can use for the next block, bloodwork, compounds, injuries, progress, goals… and of course how the last block has gone.

He usually has a good idea of that anyway, because we are in touch repeatedly throughout the block. Some times more than others, but I really have to stress this point:

In contrast with other coaching reviews — I can’t state this enough:   
**HE** CHASES **ME** FOR FORM CHECK VIDEOS AND FEEDBACK ON SESSIONS… 

Not after every session, certainly. But when it makes sense to, he will check in if he hasn’t heard from me - a week or so into the first block of a cycle, at midpoints, as we are heading into a big week, etc etc. ""How’s it going, how’s the knee, any joint issues, how’s fatigue, are you pausing those reps properly, let me see that from a good angle for depth.""

Between checkins, we communicate in a variety of ways. Instagram DMs and voice notes, primarily, and that’s where I’ll shoot him form check vids. Then for the checkin I upload a selection of clips to a google drive that he has access to.

Another note, and a huge difference from shitty insta coaches: he often adapts and makes changes during the block in response to feedback, issues, niggling injuries, and sometimes just when my life gets in the way, which it does fairly often. ""*Hey, let’s ease up on cardio if recovery is suffering, add 200 cals heading into this final couple of weeks, let’s drop the reps on those backoff sets, take that percentage down after your overshoot last week*,"" whatever makes sense given the issue being addressed. It's not rocket science, but it's incredibly helpful, consistent, and always there.

Another issue I want to stress: he is educating me - about training, bloods, programming, etc. Nothing is ever given as an instruction without an explanation. Maybe other people don’t need this, but I personally find it impossible to follow advice without a rationale, otherwise I end up self sabotaging.

&#x200B;

**Pharma**

I won’t go into full details here but he has a lot of understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various different compounds and their timing across a cycle. What to expect in terms of sides, and how to manage them. How to be judicious and conservative in their application.

Not confined to just AAS, and with a big focus on understanding and tracking blood markers over time, risk/reward considerations, etc.

I also know that most of the people he trains with are natty.

&#x200B;

**Results:**

**Squat Progress**

From 342lb (low bar, RPE 10 , bicep agony, not to depth) last fall

To 360lb (high bar, pain free, to depth, more in the tank) in August.

Hoping to smash this in my next strength block, and should do.

Excuses: We have totally rebuilt my squat. My shoulder reconstructions meant anything over 80% low bar left me with a useless left arm for a day or two, with severe bicep and elbow pain. I had terrible knee tendinitis in both knees where I had patellar tendon surgery about five months ago. So around 4 months ago we switched to high bar and rebuilt the mechanics.

So while load hasn’t shot up enormously, I have moved to high bar and still progressed, while becoming pain free, sustainable and there has been a lot of technical progress. 

&#x200B;

**Bench Progress**

209lb starting -> 248lb 

All the progress here has been in spite of my uneven, janky, narrow inclinable bench that offers little stability.

It’s the lift where I feel my home setup and a lack of hands on, in person guidance hurts me the most. 

&#x200B;

**Deadlift Progress**

364lb -> 463lb tested in August

This is probably the fairest demonstration of the progress you can expect from working with u/achy_breaky_joints. If you have access to a decent gym, proper equipment, and the actual functioning joints of an adult human. Because obviously none of my weird janky setup affects deadlift capabilities, unless using the world's fattest bumpers somehow makes pulling harder. So it has just been a case of the programming and technique advice from him doing its work.

&#x200B;

**Bodyweight**

Starting 225lb, currently 10lb down at 215lb with a vastly better body comp. Aiming to compete at 220. 

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

This has been a bit disorganised, and like I say, it is no way an attempt at an unbiased appraisal, because I enjoy the guy’s company and value his input. But I know he is in this for entirely the right reasons, and I’m happy to support him by recommending him as highly as he deserves.

"# Introduction

Pretty long post. Feel free to ask any questions, I would love to answer/try to answer them. 

Background/Filler:

/\* For some background, I am a fairly athletic, ex-high school football player kind of guy with some solid (albeit sometimes misguided) lifting experience. In high school, I was taught to squat poorly, and as a result, squats/powercleans sort of destroyed my knees. After watching some videos a couple months back, I realized that I could \*maybe\* overcome my knee issues by changing how I approached my squat. Enter: Smolov Jr. squat program. 

I started back at the gym, squatting usually once a week (though it was usually more like 3 times a month), back in October. I had maintained a good bit of my strength, but started slowly. Before last month, I touched 315 maybe only once or twice, and generally used 275 as my working weight. I hit 365 for a rocky set of 5 last month, and after week of vacation, I decided to begin smolov jr.

\*/

I am 5'10"" \~230, deadlift pr of 475, and bench max of 345. I used 415 as my max for this program (projected from a set of 5 with 365). I used this [calculator](https://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-jr-calculator/) for smolov jr. Instead of setting an increment up front, I decided to change it after each week, depending on difficulty.

 

# Week 1

**W1D1: 6x6 w/ 290 lbs.**

This was a little boring *at first*. I had decided to do timed 2 minute rest intervals on week 1 so as to resemble closer to a hypertrophy phase for the program. Warm ups were easy, weight moved okay, and I got an insane leg pump by the end of the workout.

**W1D2: 7x5 w/** **~~310~~** **315 lbs.**

This day pretty much replicated day 1. I did 315 instead of 310 because I'm convinced 3 plates is actually lighter than 2 plates+25+10+5+2.5 plates. 

**W1D3: 8x4 w/ 335 lbs.**

This day was challenging. My last two sets fell outside of my timer and I was *gassed* by the end. This might be a hot take, but 8x4 is the hardest day of the program. My legs felt good afterwards though, and my form didn't break down much. These days also seemed to be the best for my form.. I think more than 4 reps causes me to lose focus on form, and instead shifts my focus to completing each set as fast as possible to minimize time under the bar. 

**W1D4: 10x3 w/ 355 lbs.**

This day was alright. The first sets were hard and a little intimidating, but somewhere around the fourth set, I hit a nice stride and things began to feel a little automatic; I didn't have to get pumped before each set, and the weight began to feel lighter. Around set 8, I experienced a similar wall as the day before and went outside of my rest interval. Unfortunately, those two sets had a pretty severe form breakdown. After this workout, I considered quitting the program because my knees were killing me from reverting back to my old form. I had a lot of DOMS going into this day, and then I had a lot of joint pain coming out of it. Don't let your form break down y'all. 

# 

# Week 2

I decided to add 25 lbs. this week because I'm impatient. I probably wouldn't recommend this. However, it was such a FUN experience for me (I'm being actually serious). I moved my rest interval up to 2m30s.

**W2D1: 6x6 w/ 315 lbs.**

I attacked this day with a lot of excitement. Unfortunately, my form was a little shitty due to that fact. As a result, I was awarded knee pain. The weight was so freakin light though. In the words of the great [Ivan Djuric](https://www.youtube.com/user/batice23), I was feeling POPPY. 

**W2D2: 7x5 w/ 335 lbs.**

I did not want to do this. Actually, I fully convinced myself that I shouldn't do this. Inspired by Ivan, I increased the amount of time spent on warming up and I grinded this workout out. It was hard man. Definitely the hardest one yet, *at first.* The last 3 sets were easier than the first four. 

**W2D3: 8x4 w/ 360 lbs.**

I approached this day the same as the last. I wasn't very excited to do it, but I was itching to squat dude. I felt like one of those mice in the cage with the cocaine button. I didn't want to eat. I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to SQUAT. It ended up being pretty fun towards the end of the workout. There's a pattern forming here that I didn't realize before: **My warm-ups are woefully inadequate and I wasn't warmed up properly until I was \~3 sets deep into the workout.**

**W2D4: 10x3 w/ 380 lbs.**

This was the hardest day of the cycle. My knees, ankles, and hips felt frozen from all the volume. I hit the bar for a set of 20 to warm up, and then had to hit 2 sets of 135 before I moved up to 225 and so on before starting my working sets. I have never felt this sort of fatigue before from lifting. Imagine running a 10k (mind you runners, I'm a big guy and thats a lot of strain for my frame), drinking a beer, and trying to go workout a quarter and a half into some cruddy football game. That level of stiffness is how I felt at the END of my warm up. **I DO NOT DESERVE THESE LEGS, MAN**. I finished the workout with one of the biggest senses of accomplishments I have ever felt. 

# 

# Week 3

Not even 24 hours after finishing that workout from hell, my legs were just itching to squat. Upper body days sucked because they were just so boring. Bench? No thanks, I can't get excited for that [light ass weight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbzm4cT5sDM). I stuck with +10 pound this week (sorta) because I didn't like all that fatigue last week. I moved my rest periods to 3 minutes. I extended my warm ups a great deal. It takes me a pretty long time to warm up now. 

**W3D1: 6x6 w/ 325 lbs.**

Felt like a bench press, ie. I was bored. I did my sets in less time than required because I felt like I was just walking around trying to see how far I could stick my thumb up my ass. 

**W3D2: 7x5 w/ 345 lbs.**

Almost equally as easy. To say it was light would be not true, because I did feel a great deal of weight on my shoulders, but I honestly think I could hit a breathing set of 15-20 with 345. It just wasn't hard to squat with it. I kept to my rest intervals for the first 4 sets, then got bored in finished the last 3 sets like two minutes early. 

**W3D3: 8x4 w/** **~~367.5~~** **375 lbs.**

This was a fun day. The weight was challenging, the squats were heavy, and my music was loud. My last set included some terrible form, but during this workout, I think the mind-muscle connection with my hips was elevated to a new level. I could feel a certain rotation in my hips at the bottom of my squats that was just euphoric. I went up in weight because days 1 and 2 didn't really stimulate my itch for squatting.

**W3D4: 10x3 w/** **~~387.5~~** **405 lbs.**

Just a hard and heavy. I was going to do 395 or 405 and decided to start with 405. It was heavy and the heaviness was a little awkward. The weight didn't move fast, and I found myself panting pretty uncontrollably after each set. I don't think my breathing was an issue, however, because my brain felt fine and perfused. The last set was the closest I came to failure all cycle. At heavier weight, I fail to keep a proper back/hip angle and start to over-utilize the erectors and the back muscle gang. This felt like a huge accomplishment. To do a 10x3 with what was essential your max prior is a great feeling. I strongly doubt that I could have even squatted 405 before this program.

# Max Day (week 4)

**Warm-up**

**405x5**

Probably an RPE of 7-8. This set was what I wanted out of my max day. I was concerned that heavier weight would feel funny and cumbersome (I was right), so I wanted to know if my working sets for my next workout cycle would be appropriate. 5x5 w/ 405 here I come. 

**455x1**

So easy lol. 

**495x1 (fail)**

Huge jump, I know, but there was a line forming for the squat rack at the gym and there was some back down work that I really wanted to do. I don't like the way maxing feels on my knees and I'd rather stick to 75-85% of my 1rm every day for a lot of volume than do even just one set at 95%+. I lost control with my back and bailed the weight forward. The strength for the lift may have been there (it would have been close, between like 100-102% of my max), but the coordination was not. My butt rose and my shoulders didn't. I don't have a video, but my partner confirmed my suspicion. I'm so not worried about it, I think I'm a heavy singles workout or two away from this weight or more (but screw that). 

# Conclusions/Takeaways

Get wrist wraps.

Warm-up longer and you can squat more often. 

Do this program if you want to love squats. 

Don't do this program if you're into bodybuilding. It'll make your upper body workouts bland. 

I don't wish that I stretched more, but *not* stretching is just plain stupid unless you like to be in pain 24/7. Also, foam rollers are nice. 

Creatine is cool. I can't really tell how much it helps though.

I got an honest +45 pounds on my squat. If we want to speculate, you could argue that I got +70 pounds. Thats 405 to begin with (which I doubt my capability of) up to 475 (which I didn't attempt, but should have/probably would have gotten). But I didn't do that, and +15 pounds/week on squat is a cool feeling. I deadlifted two days ago and 455 felt more like 365. My form isn't consistent at higher weights with sumo though, so I could be under-selling a lot of gains there. I failed 495 which would have been a PR. I love this program, and I'll do it again sometime this summer. Maybe it'll be the program that gets me to a 550 squat? That's some wishful thinking, but barring injuries I think it's possible.

&#x200B;

TLDR: WE LIKE THE SQUAT

Edit: I hit 405x8 two days after my max attempt","powerlifting, fitness"
"Building up to my last meet I was training 4 times a week (volume day, technique day, heavy squat and bench day, and heavy deadlift day). I did make some good progress, but after speaking to a few other people they only seemed to train 3 or even 2 times per week.

Just wondering what the most common training frequency seems to be. If there's a chance I could be making more progress leading up to my next meet by only training twice a week I don't want to miss out!","powerlifting, fitness"

Sorry. this is way longer than anticipated. 

**Meet Prep**

I competed July 24th and totaled 645kg@90kg (USPA). I ran a couple of blocks of my own stuff and then ran TSA's 9 Week Intermediate Program with some light pause squats on Day 4 and some shoulder/leg/arm work added in to help with hypertrophy. I hit 235/150/300 the week before running the program to find relative maxes to help guide my training. 

During prep, I had to bow out on several days on squat due to patellar tendinitis and then some bench work at the end due to some arthritic issues in both elbows. Prep was never great. I had some good sessions for specific lifts, but I never could string together good weeks for each lift, and they all felt very inconsistent and uncomfortable for the duration of prep. Sleep was inconsistent due to working 3 nights/week that changed every week and i think that really affected recovery. I also got THE shot 11/29 and never felt right afterward- not making a statement other than that i never felt right afterwards. 

The week of the meet, I ran CBB's meet week since I've done it in the past and it worked nice for me. Openers moved how they should've on Mon/Tue. Felt rough rest of week which included 8 lb water cut. 

**Day of Meet**

I barely slept the night before due to parents being in the house and my dad's insomnia/wandering. They also had all the doors open which threw off spatial awareness. Woke up @ 205.1 lb, had a granola bar, took my normal meds, and drove to the meet to get there an hour early as i normally do.  I weighed exactly 93.00 kg, slammed a Pedialyte, protein shake, and another granola bar. 

\-Squats-

Right at the beginning of warming up for squat, the power went out at the gym (weather), and it cut warm-ups for a lot of us, and others did it in the dark. There was no communication from those running the meet regarding timing or anything until they decided they were ready to roll in 10 min which sucked, so i had to go from 0-225kg in 10 min in a cold gym with stiff knees. 

* Opener: 225 kg- moved okay. Had a TON of pain. Limped off the platform and had to convince my handler to give me more.
* Second: 235 kg- best its moved ever. More pain. Toe-tapped off the platform. Limped around. Had to pee, and with the power outage, had to go out in the 40 deg weather to pee after this which cooled me down a ton. 
* Third: 240 kg- missed. Pain was rough. Knee was swollen

\-Bench- 

It'll moved faster from this point on. Thanks for the patience. Warm-ups were fine. Nothing of note. Had some McDonald's because someone at the meet threw my Chipotle away. 

* Opener: 140 kg- moved great. Was set too high, so I had my rack height lowered by 2.
* Second: 150 kg- missed. Felt a sharp pain in left pec/shoulder area when I unracked and was killing me during the lift. I went and stretched, did some tricep/shoulder work, and hoped for the best for the third.
* Third: 150kg- missed. Was really hurting. Tried a narrower grip to get chest out of the movement. I cramped on the way down and struggled to get it to my chest. 

\-Deadlift-

I considered going lighter on opener to just get through the meet but wanted to push for first and possibly win for deadlift. 

* Opener: 272.5 kg- missed. Was thrown off by how the stiff bar felt and how smooth it felt, so I relaxed and this isn't a weight to relax with. Let's move up
* Second: 287.5 kg- missed. They said there was downward motion before down command. It felt nice. I tried to bring it to the jury. They said it was a good call, so I thanked them and moved on. I wanted 300, so I called it.
* Third: 300 kg- missed. Didn't move. I was fried. Had to hop off the platform because of my knee. 

**Thoughts**

Bombed out. My parents were in town. Girlfriend made it. Handler was great. A couple other friends were able to come down. I would have loved a shot at 700kg but it wasn't there. There's a lot that would have been nice, but I train to train. I compete for the social aspect and to have something to train for sometimes. I don't care so much to build totals but to push myself, and if that means missing more than I'd like, then it does. I'm happy with that. I give it my all, and sometimes it just isn't there. 

It wasn't a great meet but I tied PR on squat and bench and narrowly missed a 17.5kg PR on deads. Prep wasn't good. I need a break from meet prep and from thinking about competing. I'll cut and hopefully get healthy soon. As far as programming, I will go back to doing my own from scratch as that's what has worked best for me in the past. Nothing wrong with TSA's program. It just wasn't what I needed programming wise, but the back work every day was huge and I'll definitely work on leaning more towards that. 

Thanks for reading!

"**PREP**  
This was my 5th meet, with the first being February 2018.  
Started this meet prep a week after a July 24th meet, and knew i wanted to use the 3 months to do strength/ ""re peak"" rather than try and fit a lot of volume in after having done a lot of that leading up to the first meet.  
I knew i needed to manage fatigue from the start to be able to push DL the way i wanted to.  
Two times per week squat w/ top single and 3X5 or 5X3, then repeating just the single day 2.  
I adapted the template from Gillinghams 12 week heavy/light bench program for this,  which waves the loading three times in 12 weeks, and i used just the heavy day 2X week in the manner described above.  
I left a few weeks just for singles practice at the end.  
For DL i did SSPT style singles only on a twice a week scheme, repeating the first few weeks twice each to fit the calendar and have last heavy pulls Wednesday the week before meet week.  
I use an inflated e1RM when i do all singles, so the repeated early weeks were useful to get some volume in before things got heavier.  
Bench programming remained unchanged.

**MEET**

A few weeks out i found out the meet would be an AM session.  
It was a 2 hour drive for me for 8 am weigh ins, so i started shifting my eating and sleeping patterns earlier, and that worked out fairly well.  
Got about 8 hours sleep Thursday night, and managed 3.5 the night before the meet.  
Weighed in at 91.5kg

**SQUAT**

ATTEMPT 1: 177.5kg/391.3lb  
Was pleased to move my opener up 2.5kg from last meet.  
Squat looked good, but i could feel i was on my toes some.  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 187.5kg/413.4lb  
This was my third in July, and the current state record for M3a\~93kg  
Little slowing mid ascent.   
Form held.  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 190kg/418.9lb  
192.5kg would have been an outright PR, but i had decided to stick to my script, as i had a specific total target which i will explan at the end.  
This moved better than either of my other attempts, with almost no discernible slowing.  
Funny how that goes.  
Three whites

**BENCH PRESS**

ATTEMPT 1: 107.5kg/237lb  
This was also 2.5kg up from my July opener  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 112.5kg/248lb  
This was my third in July  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 115kg/253.5lb  
Meet best, but not the 117.5kg i had hit well paused in training.  
I subsequently failed 117.5kg in training, and knocked all my meet attempts back based on that.  
I wanted a new meet best, and needed the kgs for my total target.  
It was the right call, as my left arm stalled for a moment on the press.  
No downward movement though.  
Three whites.  
117.5kg is the Masters 3/93kg state record, so 120kg is my target for next meet.

**DEADLIFT**

ATTEMPT 1: 205kg/451.9lb  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 2: 220kg/485lb  
New state record by 5kg  
Three whites

ATTEMPT 3: 222.5kg/490.5lb  
I had wanted my 227.5 kg for this meet, but had already decided not to attempt it.  
Right side lagged very slightly off the floor, but otherwise the lift looked way easier than it felt.  
Looking at it you might think 227.5 was there, but i'm not so sure.  
Three whites.

**RESULTS**  
27 white lights  
Meet best squat for new state record  
Meet best bench  
New all time PR deadlift for new state record  
New state record total with 527.5kg  
That total is #11 all years USAPL for M3a\~93kg Raw  
I would have needed 535kg for #10, and that was just too much risk with my bench being what it was, and a big unknown for a 227.5kg pull.  
What i did meet day was exactly what i had planned.  
Very pleased with the outcome.

**WHAT'S NEXT**  
I'm taking the week off, and resume training Saturday with my same bench program.  
The following Wednesday i start deadlift on a twice a week 3 week micro used in 9 week blocks.  
Planning on a new 5lb single PR every block as a submax pull.  
Plan on 3 blocks to end at 505lbs with a lot of volume backing that up for whenever the peak comes.  
I would most prefer a very late summer 2022 or even late fall 2022 meet this time around.  
I will be doing some sort of maintenance of squat for at least a few weeks to a month.  
Probably just a single twice a week until i feel out how the new deadlift program feels.

**Carrie Boudreau Big Pullooza Powerlifting Championships**

This meet was organised in honor of the memory of Carrie Boudreau, a multiple time world champion, world record holder, and (iirc) the first woman to deadlift 4 times bodyweight in competition.  
She was from here in Maine.   
There is much more to her story, but her friend and co competitor Shelby Downing has stared this annual meet so that more people can begin to become aware of who Carrie was, and her accomplishments in powerlifting, and in life.

TLDR: [3rd attempts](http://imgur.com/a/Ei9SDFF)


So my meet prep was an absolute trainwreck. I locked up my trap, pulled something in my hip/glute, and then trashed my wrist so I was not peaked at all but I did get some good workouts in they gave me some confidence. Then about 10 days out I got a stomach bug that initiated a violent water cut. As I was getting a covid test just to be safe, my very pregnant wife said she was having bad contractions. I was still wiped out and barely able to stand up but Friday evening we were in the hospital. Saturday morning we welcomed our second child and first daughter, we got home Sunday evening. Between being in the hospital and being sick I had lost 11lbs so filling out to 242 wasn't happening. 


I changed my game plan and decided to open very light at 250/180/250. I weighed in at 102kg and actually felt really good considering everything going on. The 250 squat and 180 bench were state records, the deadlift record was 272.5 so I figured I'd go for it on my third if I was still feeling good.


My squat opener absolutely flew and I knew it was going to be a good day, I jumped up to 265kg and it looked more like an opener. My previous PR was 275, my best case scenario was a 2.5kg PR so I stuck to it and took 277.5 for my third. It was hard but I definitely had more in the tank. 3/3 with all white lights.


Bench is my main chick, she's solid and always there for me. My previous PR was 190kg, I really wanted 200kg so I went 180, 190, 200 and hit all three, again all white lights.


I hate deadlifts, they are inconsistent and hard. I had missed 605lbs in my last week of training so confidence was low. My 250 opener felt like 200 so I jumped to 265 and it felt even better. I decided to just grab 280 for my third, it wasn't a PR but I didn't want to make a huge jump and miss. 280 came right up with almost no struggle and I wrapped up the meet 9/9 with all white lights. I left some on the table but I think I played it smart. I could have taken 4th attempts on all my lifts but I didn't want to yolo something and get hurt and for some reason I think powerlifting is 3 attempts and you move on so I didn't take any 4th attempts. 


They had best lifter prizes for juniors, open, and masters so I won best open male lifter and then ""director's choice"" which I assume was best male lifter. I won $100 from Iron Rebel and Kabuki, free knee and elbow sleeves from Anderson, $75 from Depth Before Dishonor, $50 from Raw Grip Strength, and a free Breath Belt for the Open lifter award and a free custom Pioneer belt and some supplements for the overall best lifter.","powerlifting, fitness"
"As the title says I have cerebral palsy and just joined back in the gym after some years off. I’m perfectly fine walking and can do all the major lifts I have to squat with elevated shoes due to my rom, and have no problem gaining strength in my legs. My question is would I be able to put plates or something under my feet when I bench to keep my feet flat. Due to my flexibility I can’t really touch the floor while laying on a bench, I would like to compete one day, my condition is strictly lower body and I have always had a strong bench.","powerlifting, fitness"
"First of all I recognize that this meet took place at the same time and has the same name as the actual Showdown meet and this was not that one. Feel free to move on if you were hoping to read about someone significantly stronger than me. 

I have been lifting since late 2015/early 2016 and focused on competing since about the middle of 2016. This was my fifth powerlifting meet. [Link to my last meet report](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/armon8/meet_report_usapl_washington_state_championships/?) )]. I didn’t intend to take such a long break, but I blew off USAPL and was gearing up for my first USPA meet in early 2020 when COVID hit. Anyway you know the rest of the story. This meet added 137 lbs to my official total. 

Since my last meet, I hired a coach who I think is fantastic and have gotten much stronger. My gym total is 387.5 kg. I also joined a barbell club/strength specific facility and love that as well. The barbell club opened two weeks before the shutdowns in Washington due to COVID. During the reopening, and throughout the lockdowns, the members of the gym have sometimes been the only people I saw regularly outside of my home, and they were a strong support system and point of contact for me during a very difficult time. That made it especially fun that a bunch of our members competed in this meet and a crew came down to handle and cheer. 

*The Meet*
The Drug Tested Showdown took place Saturday, September 25th and was hosted at Hardcore Barbell in Vancouver, Washington. The meet was run extremely efficiently and quickly, I was done with deadlifts by 2. Also, they had enough squat and deadlift bars that we could warm up on them which had been something I was worried about for my first USPA meet. 

*My prep*
The week prep was supposed to start, I sprained my ankle and had to wear a walking boot for a week. I started prep with bench only. After a week, I added back box squats but no deadlifts. After two weeks, I was able to lose the box and pull again. My best lifts in prep were a 140 kg squat, a 72.5 bench, and a 167.5 deadlift. My all time bests are 140/75/172.5. I also had some big rep PRs and all around felt awesome. I was amazed at how quickly I bounced back from the ankle especially given my age. 

My goals for this meet were to hit the qualifier for drug tested nats next year so I had the option to go if I wanted to, otherwise I just wanted to have a nice time. I didn’t have big expectations for myself. 

This was my first 24 hour weigh in, but I actually weighed in at 5 PM the day before. I cut a little too much weight by stopping water around noon on the day, so I came in at like 81.6. I was really only half a pound over but sweating on the 3 hour drive and little water got me there and then some. 

[Videos of lifts](https://youtu.be/on9EDIUJ8yc)

SQUAT: 

1: 130 kg/286 lbs my ankle didn’t have any pain, but it took a long time for the mobility to come back and that was having an effect on my depth occasionally. We opened conservatively in case I was having problems and needed something I could sink no matter what.

2: 140 kg/308 lbs took a big jump and it paid off. I have been adjusting to the recognition that a 10 kg jump in my squat is no longer a big risk. 

3: 145 kg/319 lbs I don’t think this was a bad call based on how 140 moved but I did not have the positional resiliency to keep it from rolling up my back. This is how I have missed every squat that I have missed for the past year. I need to start looking up. My coach has been telling me this and I sort of half assed it by starting to look more forward but not really up enough. 

At this point a headache started. Excedrin held it off for a bit but coffee/water/salt and snacks could not do it, I think it was a stress headache since I had been so concerned about my squats. My coach and I texted throughout the day and he gave me my warmup plans. 

BENCH: 

1: 65 kg no worries 

2: 70 kg no worries 

3: 75 kg worries, first time in my life I’ve missed a bench in competition. I have hit this in the gym but with a bad pause.

Like squats before, this wasn’t a bad call. I really think I wasn’t ready for either the pace of this meet (there were only 3 flights) or the skill of sustaining my energy through the day

Before deadlifts, I pounded an energy drink. Warmups were nice and fast.

DEADLIFT:


1: 155 kg all good, during my last warmups someone came to tell us my flight had already started. My pull was one of the last in the flight but of course the helpful stranger did not realize that so this was pulled in a bit of a panic. 

2: 165 kg little fight at the knees—I have pulled this easily in the gym and 162.5 is my best double so no reason for the problem except that I was so trashed 

3: 172.5 got it moving, stopped, moved it again, couldn’t get it. Blargh 

*What I did right* 

I am proud that I stuck to my plan and attacked my thirds anyway even when I was tired and losing confidence. I was pretty frustrated at the end of the day but the bright side is that I hit a huge meet PR and can build back up going forward. I am also glad I had a friend handle me because I was jonesing to warm up way too fast and needed to be paced. The most common phrase I heard that day was: “You have plenty of time.”

*What I wish I did differently*

I wish I had brought more food and had more coffee in the morning since I didn’t feel great all day! 

*What’s next*

I don’t know. I love competing, but a side effect of the coronavirus pandemic for me is that I don’t really want to plan for the future anymore. Before, I would plan things for myself and then want them because I had planned them. When my plans (for everything, not just powerlifting) were derailed in early 2020, I realized I didn’t know what I wanted anymore. I would like to compete at least once a year as long as I can since I enjoy it so much, but otherwise I don’t really know what that looks like. I like the idea of going to the National meets since I think it would be fun to travel a bit and get a competition in too. I hope to squat 150 kg by the end of the year and a stretch goal is to go after 182.5 deadlift.","powerlifting, fitness"

"Finished up my first powerlifting meet yesterday (Aug 7). Had an amazing time! Went 8/9, missing my final squat - I was told depth wasn’t there. Don’t think I missed by much and am motivated for next time! 

As what I’ve heard, the USAPL Virginia head, Sabre, put on an amazing meet! Everything was incredibly organized, professional, and smooth. I will definitely be doing this again. 

All of my lifts are in the link below. I would love any advice or critiques!

Squat: 
175kg 🔴⚪️⚪️
192.5kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
205kg 🔴🔴⚪️
My first ever lift I got one red as I learned my knee does a slight buckle right before I go, which is an issue for the judge. No problem, an easy fix! My second lift flew up no problem and wanted to hit a PR. In my final lift, I grinder through and thought I crushed it, but was given two reds for depth. I was disappointed in that but know now for next time I have to leave no doubt on depth. 

Bench:
145kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
157.5kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
170kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
Now to bench. My first lift I think I went too light - I almost pre-racked because it felt like a warmup. Second lift felt smooth and I knew going in I wanted to hit 170. So third attempt - this might be the longest one rep I have ever done. I got stuck just past halfway and was pushing what felt like hours. I finally got it up as my glutes and lower back were cramping. But I got it. I’m really proud of myself for pushing through.

Deadlift: 
220kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
240kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
250kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️
By the time I got to deadlifts I was starting to get cramps in my upper back and quad. Luckily they ironed out through warmups. My first two attempts were very smooth so I decided to go for a big PR on my final. By the time they got to me, I was hyped up and crushed it! I think I still had another 5-10kg in me for next time. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with how everything went. I was that inch or so away on squats to have won my class, which means I am even more pumped for next time. For a first meet, the VA group really does a great job helping us make sure we know when things are happening and preventing us from making easy mistakes. 

Regarding training, I am going to do two weeks of recovery away from the barbell and then hit a base volume phase. I have to get stronger quads - biggest thing holding back my squat - and work on hip mobility so depth isn’t an issue. Regarding bench, based on that final lift, lockout strength is my weakness. And for deadlifts, I just need to push harder and believe I can do more than I think. I am hoping to compete again in January/February time frame and want to get at least a 650kg total - 220 Squat, 180 Bench, 270 Deadlift is my hopes. 

I am amazed at how motivating and supportive the powerlifting community is and am proud to be a part of it!

"TLDR: I got more out of every lift than I expected. Totalled 555 and won second in my class. Was a great meet on my part. Perfectly run and awesome people all around. You can check out my writeup (in german though!) on my [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTfQKSMiP-y/) ^(shameless plug :\^))

&#x200B;

* **Background/Leading up to the meet**

I did my own programming, transitioning from Sheiko Gold, going into the meet. It all went well. Really nothing to say about squats or bench, they were as predictable as can be. Deadlifts weren't ""perfect"" leading into the meet, but in the end it didn't matter because, alltime PR. Deadlifts have always been fucky in training, but better than expected in a meet. I had little to no stress going into the meet with my work life (new 20 hour a week job freed up some time and improved my mental health), social life (grateful for my great friends and family) and all that jazz. Nothing could have went any better, looking back at it.

On meetday I woke up at around 5AM to catch a ride with one of my gymbuddies. Didn't eat or drink for 16 hours before waking up and I felt it. No watercut though. Weighed in at 72,3. Had a Monster and a protein shake like the meet before, because I knew that would be the perfect amount to keep me afloat not just physically, but mentally. Blasted a bunch of hype music in the car and talked about all kinds of things which took the jitteryness away from me. Got to the meet perfectly on time, weighed in at 73,2. Perfect. Got ready, drank another Monster, got some rice crispies, a banana, protein bars, water...etc etc you name it, I ate some food basically, duh.

&#x200B;

* **The lifts**

^(All numbers in superior metric format! :\^))

* Squat

1. Opener-155. Flew, nothing to say here. Perfect.
2. Second-165. Same thing as above, except I got called for depth on the right side, which is silly because I felt my hammies touch my calves. The lifters before me were also called. The headjudge complained to him that he sat in such a weird, unfavourable position that even an ATG squat would look high to him. He changed it around after that.
3. Third-175. I was nervous about this number. Since my adductor injury, I haven't squatted this number in...a year maybe? It has been ages. So my handler selecting this was definitely a little bit of a shock, thinking I had this easily. And I'm happy with it. It was a good third. Don't feel like I had anything more in me.

&#x200B;

* Bench

1. Opener-130. Smokeshow.
2. Second-140. Same, but my right glute raised from the bench. Didn't set my right leg too tight, that was the reason. Decided to increase by a modest amount.
3. Third-145. I don't know and don't want to know what happened there. It felt easy. It looked easy. Gonna see what we can do in the bench nationals on the 13th October. I'm stoked for a 2x bodyweight bench if everything goes right there.

&#x200B;

* Deadlift

1. Opener-210. Felt iffy. Looked iffy. Deadlifts. I hate them.
2. Second-220. The fastest meet pull I have ever done. Hands down. And it came as such a surprise. I thought I would grind it a little bit, and get super dizzy. Instead, boom...but I still got a little dizzy which you can see in the vid
3. Third-235. I was having a talk with my handler after that smokeshow that was 220, and he wanted to put this number because it would secure the second place. ""You have it in you, just go for it"" he said, to a guy who is not very confident in his ability to deadlift, the lift he hates the most. But, we put it. My nerves were acting up like I haven't felt in a long time. The hairs were standing up all around my body. Went out with what I thought would be the perfect track, [""Crowning the Abomination""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANHHM5gINkM&ab_channel=Ingested-Topic) playing in the background. And let me tell you...without that, I wouldn't have gotten half as mentally aroused as I was. I got it. Set it down slowly. Tried to play it cool by looking around, and fell assbackwards again because...dizzy lol. Can't see it though, every vid I have seen so far only plays until the point where I set it down. Oh well.

First 9/9 meet I ever had. Total ended up at 555 and I got second place in the weightclass. Got a bench record, and had the best deadlift out of the bunch, if you discount the italian gueststarter, who had an amazing performance. ^((Hey M, I know you're reading this, you're a madlad!))

&#x200B;

* **Closing word/Personal feelings/Wrap-Up**

Great meet. No complaints. If I could nitpick at a high level, it would be that I didn't get every last kilo on bench, but nothing in training pointed to me being able to lift what I ended up lifting. So, I was just sticking to the plan. It doesn't matter because it wouldn't have made a difference in my placing.

I went into this with a cool head (until that third deadlift, WOWEE my hands were still shaking for an hour after that), and just tried to do my club proud. I think this mindset is definitely the one for me.

I accomplished everything I set out to do in the short time I had after my previous meet; work on my squat, and get better pauses on my bench. The big change I made to bench was to stop giving a fuck about ""hurr durr you lose tension at the bottom position"", and just embrace that that was just my style. To let it crash down into my chest, sink it, and press it up with a shitton of leg drive. Having no wristwraps (this happened purely because I forgot my wrist wraps for a session, and it felt fantastic) allowed me to bend my wrists back even further (which I also got shit for), putting me in an even more advantagous position. Whatever works, works. Deadlifts are gonna cruise along, fingers crossed, if I get my sub-par, shithouse squat up to snuff.

So those are still my big goals for the off-season. Improve my glaring weakness; the squat, keep the pauses crisp on bench and get a bigger chest, and let my deadlift cruise along. Gain some weight while we're at it, because I definitely got some headroom.

Thanks so much for reading and have a good one!","powerlifting, fitness"
"**TL;DR** 

Hit a 40kg meet PR after 2 semesters of DPT school at the hottest meet of my motherlovin' life, [here are the lifts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CST-YNxrYdk/)

**Background**

This was meet number 8 (holy crap) for me, and second in the USPA drug tested division, as I am an absolute simp for the deadlift bar. I had lifted on and off since high school, took things seriously around my junior year of college, and have absolutely fallen in love with the sport. Cookie cutter programs I have run in the past include Shortcut to Size, Arnold's Blueprint, a bunch of 5/3/1 variations, Squat Every Day, and Sheiko Advanced Medium Load. After I started taking things a little more seriously, IE joining OSU Powerlifting Club, I started getting free coaching from The Strength Guys. I've also been coached by my good buddy Joe Sullivan, who is a great coach in his own right, but our training philosophies just didn't align as much as I'd like. He still gives me technique critiques any time, which I cannot thank him enough for. Now I'm coached by Zac Robinson of DataDriven Strength, whom I met through OSUPL while we were both in undergrad. I also cannot sing Zac's praises enough; most definitely the best coach/""athlete"" partnership I have been a part of, and he works hard as all hell to make things as easy as possible for me.

So after I completed Meet #7, I moved from Ohio to North Carolina for DPT school. While this was a huge adjustment, it fit right in for me, as I now only had one thing to focus on (school) instead of school + job + other job + grad school applications. Granted, DPT school is still hard as all crap, but whatever; weights won't lift themselves and I hate running, so powerlifting is the hobby for me.

**Training and Goals**

The biggest training adjustment we had to make once I made the move to NC was cutting my training time *wayyyyyy* down. The university I attend is both smaller and out in the middle of no where, so the best gym I have access to is our campus gym. Due to the pandemic, it originally had 75min appointments during the Spring Semester, then 2hr sessions in the Summer Semester. However, Zac and I were able to turn this into a positive; we used it as an excuse to superset damn near everything outside of the Big 3 to cut some weight I had gained during the pandemic. Therefore, work capacity increased dramatically, I stopped jiggling when I walk (as much), and I may have even put on some muscle.

As for specifics, I squat and deadlift 2x/week and bench 4x/week. We use a combo of RPE and percentage based training in which I hit a top set (triples during hypertrophy blocks, singles during strength blocks) to a certain RPE, hit some backdowns based on a percentage of the e1RM of the top set, then accessorize in an effort to not look like a bag of sour milk. 

Ended up hitting some nice volume PR's in the months leading into the meet. This includes everything from new 8 rep maxes on all 3 to new squat and deadlift gym 1 rep maxes. Bench didn't move quite as much, probably due to the weight loss (went from 212 in January to 193 by the end of April, then maintained through the summer) but I still hit some volume PR's. Overall, the past year has been about me rediscovering my training ""floor"" and balancing some new life stuff. But it worked out very well in the end.

Goals leading up to this meet were as follows:

Primary: total 702.5kg for the NC USPA drug tested state record

Secondary: hit a 290kg+ deadlift for the NC USPA drug tested state record

Tertiary: take a moonshot at the squat NC USPA drug tested state record at 257.5kg 

**The Meet Leadup**

In the week leading up to the meet I simply enjoyed my break from finals and hit what amounts to my last warm ups on Monday and Tuesday, then went to the hecking beach (never going back to the Midwest). I hit a power session on Friday (weights at 50% for fast-ass reps), then drove about 4 hours to Charlotte for the meet. In hindsight, I definitely should have made the trip on Thursday to give myself an extra day, but ya live and learn. Weighed in Friday afternoon at a trimmer-than-I-have-been-in-3-years 87.3/192.5lbs and started prepping for the big day.

**The Meet Venue**

I just want to say I love air conditioning. This meet was held in Charlotte Strength, which is basically what I dream of when it comes to strength sports: brick walls, turf in the middle of the floor for conditioning, an entire half a floor plan of just Oly lifting platforms, free weights galore, and a nice *lacking* of unnecessary machines (yeah I said it). It also lacked AC: in the dead of a southern summer. Needless to say that bish was ***HOT.*** By the time I got to deadlifts I was completely dead, but so was everyone else so I am not complaining. Nonetheless, the meet directors put on a great meet and I will definitely be attending one of theirs again in the future.

**Lifts**

Squats were feeling good leading up. However, my bar positioning had moved up slightly during my training, and it came back to bite me square in the ass.

Opener: 230/506 got 3 whites, EZPZ

2nd: 242.5/535 matched my gym PR, got me a 2.5kg meet PR, and absolutely drained all my squat hype because I am an idiot. I got very fired up for this lift for reasons which still elude me, and by the time my third rolled around I just couldn't ""get up"" enough and I learned a valuable lesson: seconds are for gauging your thirds, not blowing your hype wad.

3rd: 252.5/556 buried me. Due to my moving my low bar positioning vertically to a more mid-bar position, my upper back became the limiting factor in my squat, and it cost me here big time. That, and just not being as hyped (regardless of how hard I hit the ammonia) meant I got embarrassed, to be frank. Front squats, all the rowing, and moving my bar position back down here I come.

Bench was fine this year. Due to losing about 20 pounds I hadn't hit any big weight PR's, but my volume PR's gave me some hope. Not training on competition equipment also left my projected attempts with some wiggle room.

Opener: 142.5/314 was probably too light, looking back

2nd: 152.5/336 was red lighted by the side judges because I got the start command before my butt was down on my set up. Decided to adjust set up and go up because this weight was easy too.

3rd: 160/353 gave me a 5kg meet PR, probably left 2.5kg on the platform here

Deadlifts were the big movers this year. However, a theme for me has been grip issues, which plagued my 2 heaviest deadlift singles in training. But we came to do a damn thing, so screw it.

Opener: 262.5/578 gave me a 2.5kg meet PR, moved easy

2nd: 280/617 would've been 2lbs over my gym PR, but due to the high humidity and me not chalking my hands enough, I never set a good hook and lost it on grip at the top. Now, I knew it moved fast. And I knew I could chalk better and put more baby powder on my legs. Therefore, I took the ballsy move and put in the attempt for the state record and got a wide-eyed stare from the scorers' table.

3rd: 290/639 moved pretty well all things considered, 30kg meet PR. I spent about 5 minutes just chalking up and thinking about not letting go of the bar unless my thumbs actually disconnected from my hands. I have no idea how much I left on the platform due to this being by far the heaviest weight I've ever had in my bare hands (or strapped hands for that matter), but it moved pretty decently I think. Took the record home and got a sweet Halo Sword for it.

**Final Thoughts**

Had a blast competing again. More or less going adjust where I place the bar when I squat, keep doing what I'm doing on deadlifts, and hope bench doesn't fall too much as I cut all the way down to 180lbs before the holidays. Also, Mods plz adjust flair. Gracias and goodnight.","powerlifting, fitness"
"What's up, new to this sub reddit, figured I'd start by maybe starting an interesting conversation about the training Bots that are starting to take off... I have downloaded the new app that Boris Sheiko designed (Sheiko Gold)... Seems very interesting and intemidating at the same time lol

Sheiko himself claims that this could be the future of training because of the AI's ability to track your mood/recovery and general adaptations. 

I am a fan of sheiko's programming principles and I am willing to try it out even though it seems somewhat pricey, I know there has been other Training AI's out there, anybody have experience with any of them?","powerlifting, fitness"

"This was my second comp, with my first in November of 2019. I have been lifting with a focus on strength for around 3.5 years now. The majority of this time, I trained using candito’s LP, gzclp, and greg nuckol’s free 28.

About 10 weeks prior to the meet, I decided that I wanted / needed a coach in order to step my game up. That being said, I started poking around for anybody doing online coaching. I found /u/tweezy2eezy / [@tweezy2eezy](https://www.instagram.com/tweezy2eezy/) and seeing as how he is a fellow big body, with established clients and has a pretty big total, I asked him if he could run my peak for this meet. Check him out here as well, at  [http://buffbarbell.com/](http://buffbarbell.com/) .

**Background and Training:**

Before we started working, I expressed how I like to train and what my humble home gym is capable of. He took everything into account and utilized pretty much every aspect of the equipment I have available. Due to living in Japan, and Antjuan in Texas, we communicate with best effort, but he still replies pretty damn quick most days.  For my form / technique , he has been a huge asset and my squat and deadlift form has greatly benefited. For bench, we got a bit bogged down with some forearm/ elbow pain, but after implementing exercises that he recommended, I’ve been able to keep the pain to a minimum. The normal training schedule leading up the meet was four days, with 2 squat / 3 bench / 1 deadlift session.

**Lead Up to the Meet:**

Considering I had only deadlifted roughly three times in the last year in order to focus on squats / bench, I wasn’t expecting to dl too much at the meet. In the first few weeks with Antjuan I even struggled to deadlift well below my max. However, I adapted to the added stress pretty quickly, and with his form analysis, we slapped deadlifts into shape. Bench was getting totally screwed from squatting though, so we had to take it easy on bench going into the meet.

Few weeks prior to the meet, we discussed attempts based off my last few weeks performance's. I had really wanted to hit a 700 total, but we thought 685 was a more reasonable goal. For my weight class, I was going off the see-food diet and thus weighed in at a tiny 114kg in the 120s.

**Meet Day:**

My wife was also competing for her first time, so we got to the venue early , even though I wouldn’t be starting / weighing in until 1400. I was happy about it though, since I could watch all of her lifts and help with her warmups. She’s got her own coach [@kanan.pl](https://www.instagram.com/kanan.pl/), who is the national 52kg champion and host of [@BarbellRadio](https://www.instagram.com/barbellradio/) in Japan, [https://www.youtube.com/c/BarbellRadio](https://www.youtube.com/c/BarbellRadio).  She ended up handling both my wife & I, and did an excellent job with helping me pick attempts during the meet as well.

Having got roughly three hours of sleep the night prior, I took 2 200mg caffeine pills before squats and half a scoop of preworkout. Throughout the day I was chowing down on onigiri and gummy worms.

[Lift Videos](https://www.instagram.com/p/CO-qYcHBXCx/?utm_medium=copy_link)

**Squats (3/3 230/255/267.5):**

I love squatting , and I was feeling good on meet day. My first attempt flew and from that moment, I knew it was game on for 700kg total. Made light work of the second  as well, so I discussed with my handler about the third. We decided to keep it conservative and go for 267.5 to lock in the best shot at the goal total.

9/9 white lights

**Bench (3/3 145kg/155kg/167.5kg):**

Bench was the true wild card here as I wasn’t sure how much pain my arms would be in after squats. It turns out that I had zero pain whatsoever. All of my attempts flew here and I think I could have put a solid 10kg on my last attempt.

9/9 white lights

**Deadlifts (3/3 235kg/255kg/267.5):**

By this point, I was still feeling fresh and I knew I was about to drop some bombs on deads. I blew up my first and second , and discussed with my handler if I should pick something crazy for thirds. We decided to play it safe to get 702.5.

9/9 white lights

**Results and Plans Going Forward:**

[@PowerliftingTPA](https://www.instagram.com/powerliftingtpa/) ran a great meet with the staff / announcers / spotters all being excellent. I managed to get best lifter and PRs on all lifts with plenty left in the tank for all three. I was extremely satisfied with my  performance and so happy that my wife also had a great experience for her first meet. From now, Antjuan and I will be running through some strength cycles for which I am super excited to start. I’m planning on doing Nationals next year,  so I just need to get a qualifying total next! The journey for a 2k total continues!","powerlifting, fitness"

"This was my first meet. I weighed in at 247.2 so I had to bump up to the 275 weight class. My scale at home was under and I thought I was good, but it wasn’t a huge deal. Everything moved well. I went 8/9 my second attempt bench with 407 was red lighted because the bar descended after the press command. Still ended up winning 1st for Raw Classic at 275 weight class.

• SQUAT •

I didn’t progress much on squats but this is on me. I have trouble getting my hips under the bar and keeping my upper back tight. If I fix this I am sure that my numbers will go up very fast. 

In addition, due to a minor knee pain, I skipped almost all double squat sessions during prep 2. (Sheiko gives Squat,Bench,Squat in the same session). The knee also made me choose box squats a lot of times and this isn’t the best variation for my weaknesses.

• BENCH PRESS •

Well, you can see my butt coming off the bench, so it’s obvious that my form needs work here too. Benching four times a week has been very beneficial though. My upper back tightness and my bar path have seen hugeee improvements. If I learn to use my lower body correctly, my bench press will look very beautiful (in my opinion lol). 

Happy with BP progress? Yeah! It’s my worst lift and 4 months ago I hated laying on the bench. Now, after ~65 bench sessions, I am starting to like it. 

• DEADLIFT •

I will keep it short here. It’s a fcking miracle!!! 30kg / 66lbs increase in four months! Do I need to write another word here? 

— FINAL THOUGHTS —

Sheiko Gold has been a game changer for me. It’s perfect for my minimal home gym and it’s making me stronger at a steady pace (except for deads lol). What else do I need? 

Is it for you? This is how I would rate the options.

\*\*Tl;Dr:\*\* I went 8/9 and squatted 562, benched 413, pulled 628. 39lb squat PR, 11lb bench PR, matched my deadlift PR and narrowly missed a 661 deadlift. 49lb total PR. I'm taking a long offseason to get fucking huge and I'm not competing again until I have a 500+ DOTS.

&#x200B;

\*\*SQUAT\*\*

1st: 230kg/507lb--V easy, first time opening over 500 which is neat

2nd: 245kg/540lb--also easy, probably could have opened with this, already a decent PR here

3rd: 255kg/562lb--still had 5-10kg in the tank IMO, 39lb PR

&#x200B;

It's really neat what happens to a lift when you stay healthy for more than a few months. Next goal is 600+ and I really don't think it's that far away.

&#x200B;

\*\*BENCH PRESS\*\*

1st: 175kg/386lb--easy, I don't know if I told them the wrong rack height or what but the hooks were super low and my unrack sucked

2nd: 182.5kg/402lb--decent, I knew I wasn't getting my goal of 424 but still had a bit left, felt much better after the rack heights got adjusted

3rd: 187.5kg/413lb--I think this was my first true grinder bench in a meet ever. I did not have a single pound left to give on this but my positioning stayed tight. I think I've finally figured out how to bench.

&#x200B;

Next goal is 200kg. It's going to take a while but idgaf. I've benched 2xBW in two weight classes now (165 and 198), figure I should go up one and get a third, then see if I can go 181 without dying and do it.

&#x200B;

\*\*DEADLIFT\*\*

1st: 267.5kg/589lb--easy

2nd: 285kg/628lb--maybe even easier, just matched my previous PR to lock in a 1600+ total.

3rd: 300kg/661lb--my grip issues reared their ugly head on this one. Bar rolled out of my right (under) hand around midway up and I knew I was done for but kept pulling anyway. Got it really close then felt it roll even further and had to drop it.

&#x200B;

Gotta figure out that right hand grip--it's not necessarily a grip issue, I think I have some sort of restriction somewhere up the chain that makes it want to internally rotate and lets the bar roll down into my fingers. It's improved a lot in the past year but I still have room for improvement.

300kg was a bit of a YOLO attempt that I had planned after securing my 1600lb total if I knew I was winning my weight class. I think I could have pulled 650 on this day but I wanted that number. A tiny bit of tweaking and it's there. Aiming for 700+ for the next meet.

&#x200B;

\*\*OVERALL PLACING\*\*

I won the men's open 90kg raw class by about 30kg, and ended up in 4th for the raw overall with a 473 DOTS. The last deadlift would have gotten me to 483 and third place. First place had over 520 (over 530 for the classic raw men).

&#x200B;

\*\*The Meet Overall\*\*

Everything leading up to this meet was interesting. At first there were a ton of people signed up for this meet, including some very big names such as Kevin Oak and Ashton Rouska, as well as a bunch of people from a gym I go to, then a shit ton of people dropped out. The meet was planned for 120 lifters--there ended up being just 65. They even had to ask for volunteers to be spotters and loaders at this meet. That being said, it was incredibly well ran, with four Ghost combo racks in the warm up room, plenty of calibrated plates for everybody, and it went decently fast with two platforms.

The main issue is that Coleman, Texas is in the middle of fucking nowhere. It's close to an hour from the nearest airport in Abilene, which only has flights to and from Houston and Dallas. There was essentially no cell service during the meet. Also, this was in the middle of dove hunting season which is a huge deal in the area so all the local AirBnBs were either sold out or crazy expensive. I stayed in Abilene and rented a car and while a hassle, it wasn't too bad.

I did get to meet Taylor Gohn and Ben Pollack at the meet (shout out to Ben to being one of the few big names that didn't drop out), and had them on for an episode of my podcast which went really well.

\*\*Notes on Training Leading Up to this Meet and Moving Forward\*\*

For the last year and a half I worked with Jake Hartman, owner of DSM Barbell in Des Moines, Iowa, and a long-time friend. He did an amazing job, helping me put over 150lb on my total in that time and accomplish some long-standing goals of mine. I recommend him to ANYBODY looking to make progress, whether they are a beginner or elite lifter. You can reach out to him via Instagram at @ dsmgymdaddy or his gym's website here: [https://www.dsmbarbell.com/pages/online-coaching](https://www.dsmbarbell.com/pages/online-coaching)

That being said, it was time for me to move on to a different style of training, and I will be working with Ranson Lee, who has competed at the Kern U.S. Open and is currently chasing his IFBB pro card in bodybuilding. He ran my nutrition for the last few weeks leading into this meet and I want to see how I do having one person handle every aspect for me, and I think using a more bodybuilding-centric training style for a long offseason will benefit me a lot as I look to put on 20-30lb over the next couple of years. You can reach out to Ranson via Instagram at @ ransonlee.","powerlifting, fitness"
"This meet for the most part was a nice meet to dust the cobwebs off my singlet. Training wasn’t really going well and I was convinced my pro lifting dreams were over. After going 3/3 in squat I remembered that my meet prep training always feels inadequate and then everything comes together when it matters. 

I didn’t PR but I came pretty close to matching my squat best and looking back on it, I should have tried to match it. All I know is a 200kg+ squat is DEFINITELY coming at my next meet. For bench I was fuming the whole time. People kept hijacking the warmup rack I was using without even asking if I was done or if they could hop in. Bench is always my weakest event so the anger definitely helped. Going into deadlifts I was pretty confident I’d be able to pull something nice. I barely wore my belt in training because it digs into my belly (finally found a solution that doesn’t involve getting a custom belt: pull sumo) but everything went well. I always get nervous during warm ups when my openers feel heavy however after a solid bench and squat, I was confident I’d be alright. 

I was snubbed for best lifter because the meet director quickly glanced at the results. I couldn’t correct him right when it happened because they started awards the minute I sat down for the drug test. This wasn’t a matter of a decimal point either. I won by six IPF points. To make matters worse, the meet director didn’t want to rectify it right away but he gave me the best lifter medal intended for the men. Eventually he got the best lifter stuff back from the girl (he knew her personally) and offered to award me during the second session awards but I wasn’t interested. 

Went 9/9 and finished with a 190kg squat, 105kg bench, and 200kg deadlift. I’m excited for my next competition and I’m determined to pull 500lbs this year or get pretty darn close. I also finished with two new lifting goals:
1) dominate so that there is no confusion
2) dominate so much that announcers in my region know how to pronounce my last name correctly on the first try.

"Vids of the Did: https://imgur.com/a/S1cxcWU

I had the pleasure of competing in the 2021 APUWA State Championship at Rev Barbell Club over the weekend. Considering I’ve only been powerlifting since June 2020, I am proud that I have been able to become ‘competitive’ in such a short timeframe.

**Goals**

I wanted a >300kg total with a secondary goal of 110/67.5/130. I felt 50/50 on squats and confident on bench and deadlift

**Meet Day**

I wasn’t feeling the best; my weight was looking dicey and I had a real fear I wasn’t going to make weight. This resulted in me not having anything to eat from about 1pm the day prior. Not terrible considering, but I woke up feeling pretty yucky. Woke up at 5am and weighed in at home at 68.6. I knew my scales weren’t accurate, but my weight was higher at home before the qualifier where I had to weigh-in naked, so was semi-confident I’d make it. No garbage bag suit on the assault bike required. Made my way to Rev and managed to weigh in at 68.7. In light of my water cut, goals were adjusted slightly for squat and deadlift which I wasn’t happy about haha.

**Squat**

92.5kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️ 

100kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️

107.5kg ⚪️⚪️🔴

Absolute grind, really went way too low and had to really push to get up. I believe the red was for downward motion which i could see on the livestream on one side immediately afterwards. Looking at a friends video from the other side showed downward motion as well so I really got away with that one…

**Bench**

Bench is both my favourite and my least favourite. I hadn’t actually cracked 60kg in competition despite it being a very comfortable weight in gym, however I finally managed 65kg in a Novice competition a couple of weeks prior so would have been happy just to get that again.

62.5kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️

65kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️

67.5kg ⚪️⚪️🔴

I felt my butt lift on my last attempt but apparently it was only one cheek! So close to a BW bench I can taste it…

So after bench, I was 7.5kg in the lead. Considering that I was going into this thinking second by default, I was now thinking “holy shit, I could actually win this” 

**Deadlift**

Deadlifts began and I immediately died inside when I saw openers: 112.5 vs my competitors 130 😂 

112.5kg ⚪️⚪️⚪️

125kg 🔴🔴🔴

I have never been more hyped before a lift. I then completely overthought it and stuffed my grip up, got off balance and took a little walk with the bar. Lesson learned: don’t change grip. Maybe I'll sign up for a strongman event haha

So at this point, my competitor's deadlifts were looking absolutely beautiful, but I still had a chance if I got my last lift and she didn’t. So even though I failed my second, we decided to yolo the third attempt. This was what I wanted, I’ve felt in my previous competitions that all my attempts have been hard but not “holy shit I’m dying this is actually killing me” so even if I didn’t make it, I didn’t care. 

135kg 🔴🔴🔴

I didn’t look at the weights, so I had no idea what I was lifting. I lifted the bar off the floor and immediately had thoughts of Ralph Wiggums “Haha, I’m in danger”. I just kept on lifting that bar. I didn’t hear the down command so really focussed on locking out as I didn’t want to get done for that. I finally heard my coach call down and I DID IT... and then my heart was broken as I got called for hitching. 

I don’t know. I don’t think it was hitching. I think it was an absolute maximum effort and I wobbled, but that wobble didn't move the bar. Looking at the later women deadlifting, as well as some calls throughout the day, I believe there were some really questionable calls. My competitor didn’t get her last deadlift too on another questionable lockout call. So I ultimately came second, but don’t even consider it “by default” as I really fought for it and we had such close competition. 

I finally stopped crying about the call and asked my coach what I had actually lifted cos I didn’t know. When he told me I cried again and I randomly feel like crying whenever I think about it because I just can’t believe I did it. It may not be an official lift, but it’s going on the gym PR board and the PR board in my heart.

**Thoughts and Feelings**

With a 282.5kg total, I am ultimately disappointed but still pretty happy with myself. Looking at the bigger picture I have come so far in…9ish months? My first max out day at the gym was 80kg/56kg/98kg. I honestly could not have imagined that I would be able to compete at States within such a short timeframe.

**Future Goals**

* I’m going to have a break from competing (2 novice comps and 2 sanctioned comps in 6 months is exhausting) and will probably look to qualify later in the year/early next year for States again.

* I want to cut some weight so I can sit comfortably within my weight class. The anxiety and stress that comes with cutting isn’t fun and I’d rather not do it again.

* I’m going to come back next year and win it. That’s basically it. That 135kg is going to be my opener.","powerlifting, fitness"

"Still want powerlifting to be my primary activity but would like to throw in some cardio to burn a little fat and be more fit generally. I'm a 42-year-old male, just did squat 380, bench 285, deadlift 512 in competition. Not looking to break any world records so just want to add a little balance to the fitness regime.

Any suggestions or experiences to share for what kind of cardio you've thrown in while still powerlifting to be less fat and more fit?","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background and Training**

* This was somehow my 7th career meet, which is crazy to me as it feels like I just started yesterday. My first competition was back in September of 2018 and man have things changed a lot since then. Between then and now, I did 4 meets in my home state of Maine, 2 in New Hampshire, all of those being local, and then one national meet (Collegiate and Junior Nationals 2021) down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in which I placed 8th overall for lightweight men on day 1 and 2nd in juniors 66s. 
* To make a long story short, I developed pretty extreme quadricep tendinitis going into Junior Nationals to the point where I heavily considered dropping out of the meet. I did almost my entire prep for that meet in my bedroom which is one of the reasons I think I developed the tendinitis issues I did. My room was on a slant, I performed barely any unilateral work and did not have access to stuff like hamstring curls and stuff of the like to offset the amount of knee extensor work I was doing. At one point I could not train the squat at all without ibuprofen, copious amounts of tiger balm, and long... long warm ups. About 21 days out from the meet, I went back to my old commercial gym and began incorporating heavy isometric leg extensions as well as isometric lunges for time and this was enough to get me to the meet in one piece. 
* Due to some unfortunate calls on the day, which at the end of the day, are on me as the athlete, I ended up going 7/9 at that meet totaling 5kg less than my best ever. The first time I had ever not PR'd my total at a competition.
* Needless to say, when I returned I was highly motivated but also very injured. I mapped out a plan of attack to rehab myself back to squatting shape and at the same time found a meet that aligned perfectly with my summer schedule. I wanted to compete one more time before I aged out of the junior division (August 1st) but also did not want it to interfere with a meet I was fortunate enough to co-direct on July 24th. This meet happened to fall the week after that meet and one day before my birthday, I could not pass it down. My training early on consisted of isometric leg extension holds before every single training session as well as high rep leg extensions and soleus/gastroc work. I introduced squatting slowly with ascending sets of 5 beltless until I reached a 4/10 pain threshold. I did this twice a week, one day with a strict tempo, the other day with no tempo but a pause. 
* To fast forward through all the boring stuff, I am back to 100% now. Feels good man. Also made strides to my upper body muscularity which I think paid dividends for my bench press.

**Meet Prep**

* I am self-programmed and via close to 3 years of trial and error, I found a system that works very well for me.
* I squat twice a week with what I think most people would consider low volume for someone my size, I pull once a week with again, pretty low overall volume from what I have seen from other lightweights (I also did one day of heavy beltless RDLs), I bench three times a week with 2 of those sessions being comp style and the other being a fairly distant variation.
* This was the heaviest I started my weight cut at, I was 69kg/151lbs 7 days out. This was intentional as I have a lot of data now from former cuts and I wanted to push it heavier for more leverage on squat and bench and this really, really paid off. Can get into more detail about this if need be but I spent close to 3 hours spitting into a bottle the morning of.
* I have peaked very poorly over the course of all my meets. I finally practice what I preached and saved some for where it counted. All of these lifts were heavier than I had gone in training, which is crazy to me.

**The Lifts**

* Went 9/9 and about as good a day as I possibly could have asked for. My goals were the following: secure a 9/9 meet, PR my total, ensure a Raw Nationals open age qualifying total. We did all of that.

**Squat**

* [**https://streamable.com/6f2dqz**](https://streamable.com/6f2dqz) **190kg/419lbs** \- This was a number that I was pretty confident in. The way I plan attempts is I start from my projected 3rd and pace back the jumps I think are reasonable to make to get to that point, in order to be on pace for my top end range, I had to open here. Moved insane, felt easy.
* [https://streamable.com/nsr8nu](https://streamable.com/nsr8nu) **200kg/441lbs -** This was the heaviest I went all prep on squat and I took it one week out and it moved insane. So, I knew this would be a good second attempt but I really had to get out of my own head about it being my heaviest of the prep. My handler on the day was unreal about filling me with confidence so when I actually walked out to take it, I knew I was gunna blow it up, felt great.
* [https://streamable.com/gwto4s](https://streamable.com/gwto4s) **207.5kg/458lbs -** Meet PR and all time PR. This one was emotional for me for a ton of reasons. Mostly because 18.5 weeks before this a bodyweight squat hurt very, very bad and I got myself all the way back to my strongest ever. Also the first time I peaked my squat to all time PR levels in a meet. Pretty cool, this felt euphoric. Not that this matters at all, but I ended up closing the flight which was the first time that has happened for me. I am very introverted but shine in front of crowds in competition, I think that is fairly normal though.
* **Bench**
* [**https://streamable.com/9n0h2m**](https://streamable.com/9n0h2m) **120kg/264lbs -** I flat out have improved my bench so much. My first meet, my 3rd attempt bench was 97.5kg/215lbs. I am not blessed with a good arch so my bench really only goes up when I put on more size on my upper body, I have really learned to love bench training and have found some cool accessories that just flatout ""work"" for me. Felt very easy.
* [https://streamable.com/72zmle](https://streamable.com/72zmle) **127.5kg/281lbs -** This actually ties my meet PR. Felt easy but I made the mistake I always tell my own athletes not to do, I did not press it back and up. Little bit of a stick because of it but I really did not panic at all.
* [https://streamable.com/a2gup0](https://streamable.com/a2gup0) **130kg/286lbs -** Top end for the day was 132.5kg/292lbs and I think that if I wanted to, I could have gotten it but again, my handler on the day was good about keeping the goal, the goal. No need risking it at this point. This was a meet PR, all time PR, and the heaviest I went for this cycle. Pretty cool. Closed the flight again here, which was a cool full-circle moment for me as my first meet I opened the flight on all my bench attempts hahah.

**Deadlift**

* [**https://streamable.com/agwp44**](https://streamable.com/agwp44) **222.5kg/491lbs -** Very easy. A cool thing to note, this was my first meet pulling with mixed grip. I switched because I noticed my hands would always, always tear pulling hook on a 29mm power bar. I could hookgrip the hell out of even the smoothest 28.5mm bars but I would have a very hard time getting my shoulders back on a 29mm. Really worked hard on my grip strength, was a great call and I am glad I was not stubborn.
* [https://streamable.com/0dzvpa](https://streamable.com/0dzvpa) **232.5kg/513lbs -** Things lined up exactly where I wanted them to. This pull secured a PR total and was very easy, I nailed my deadlift peak and heavily considered ""sending it"" on the third. My top end goal for the day was 242.5kg/535lbs but we put in 240kg for the third, knowing we could change it up or down.
* [https://streamable.com/mvwzzg](https://streamable.com/mvwzzg) **237.5/524lbs -** I was 2 goals short going into this attempt, maybe three. I wanted to go 9/9 as I have not gone 9/9 since my second meet back in 2018. I also wanted to secure my first open aged raw nationals qualifying total. I only needed 2.5kg more to secure that so I opted to go 237.5kg which was up only 5kg, secured a Raw Nationals total, gave me a meet PR deadlift, and I was extremely confident in it to secure a 9/9 day. There is nothing like a third pull man, this was euphoric. I lost it after. I cannot believe how far I have come in the short term as well as the long term. This was poetic justice and a story-book ending to my Junior career.
* **Results**
* Totaled 575kg/1262lbs with room to spare on every lift I reckon. I will take that ALL day.
* I love competing so much. My life is about to change a bit so I do not know when the next time I will compete again will be. However, I am not done with this weight class, I really feel like I have just scratched the surface to my potential.
* **Final thoughts**
* Went out the way I wanted to as a junior lifter and after a cursory look at this years totals in my weight class, this performance landed me the 7th highest total out of 84 junior lifters this year and 31st out of 356 lifters in the open division. Subject to change of course but pretty cool seeing my name climb meet after meet, year after year.

Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the sport of powerlifting with my first novice comp coming up in 5 weeks. I had recently signed up with Powerlifting Australia so I could compete in a Fed by the end of this year. But with the recent news of Robert Wilks alleged misconduct I don't think I want to continue to associate with someone who has behaved in this manner. As Robert Wilks is the CEO of Powerlifting Australia we are already starting to see a number of athletes and affiliates pulling out. Link down below for more details.

TL;DR summary: 1070 total @ 179.8 bodyweight, 9/9, BEST DAY

**Prep/Background/Crap No One Cares About Except Me/Etc.**

So after shaking off the bad juju of my [last wrapped meet](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/j5k6bu/f_31_45359_kg_821_kg_4093_wilks_2020_rps_fall/) with an unpeaked sleeved meet in [August](https://www.reddit.com/r/powerlifting/comments/p5tbne/meet_report_f_32_42411_kg_814_kg_3962_dots_raw/), I went into this prep ready to a) focus, b) avoid getting married to certain numbers, c) follow the plan and trust it even when I doubted myself, and d) have fun. While I didn't get married to any numbers, I did get engaged in September, and I swear the engagement ring gave me super powers or something. Form of a dragon, etc. But for real, having my fiancé supporting me every step of the way, encouraging me to have fun outside of the gym even when I was deep in prep, and reminding me who TF I am has been unbelievably helpful for me. I also got to see him put up a 99 PR total from his meet in May at the beginning of October, and that really gave me the itch to get back on the platform and show off.

This was my second time doing NOTB, and I can't recommend Laura's meets strongly enough. My next one will be the Women's Pro/Am in April 2022--on PRO DAY!!--and I have had so much fun doing and watching Sweatt Shop meets. You're in for a long day, since there's always a lot of geared lifters, but if you're prepared with food, that's nbd. The judging is always very fair and consistent. The number of ATWR in the building is always absurdly high, too; I mean, Dave Hoff was my head judge for bench and a side judge for squat, Laura obviously, Amy Weisenberg runs the mono, and Leah Reichman is running around helping, not to mention the ATWR competitors actually on the platform. It was an honor to share the platform with my friend Jackie, on the day she broke her own ATWR squat at 148 (!) and with Jeannine Whittaker, back on the platform for the first time in 3 years after back surgery. I had an absolute blast with this meet and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a big regional meet with high level competition. I mean, I was 5th among the raw women and I was well over 1000, so, it's a STRONG meet. 

I remain a conjugate devotee. For this prep, Lones had me do something a little different. All my really heavy deadlifts were within the first 6-7 weeks of the cycle, and I wrapped once or twice a week for the last 5 weeks. I took my last heavy deadlift (440 with reverse light bands) at 5 weeks out, pulled a heavy triple at about a month out (370x3, which was a PR), took my opener at 3 weeks out, and that was it for deads. When I saw the program I thought there was no way my body would hold up and that my elbows would surely depart my body with that much wrapped squatting, but I have never been more confident in a lift than I was in my squat heading into the meet. My platform PR prior to Saturday was 410, and frankly, it was a gift call because it was high and I had missed my first two attempts that day. During this prep I squatted 430 for a 20 lb PR, easily; 455 with reverse micros, easily; 415x2, for a 20 lb PR double; really easy triples on my secondary squat day at 370 and 380; and 357 v 100 in chain. I left some in the tank every one of those training days, which is amazing to me, still. Fiancé helped reel me in to avoid taking really stupid extra reps that would not have been helpful. Shoutout also to my physio who helped keep me in one piece. If you've never tried dry needling, YOU SHOULD. He was at the meet and worked on about 5 of us between bench and deadlift, which is the most clutch thing that has ever happened.

**FOOD AND CUT**

I had been sitting roughly at 183 for most of prep, but two weeks out was my birthday and my family came to visit and do wedding planning stuff. Mom cooked all of the food for me, and I ATE GUD. That resulted in my first ever water cut, which wasn't that miserable, but also not super effective because I'm just not someone who holds a ton of water? So idk, I'll have to find a different protocol for next time. With a little extra sweating and spitting, I made weight easily (in the grand scheme) at 179.8. I didn't have much trouble getting my weight back to about 185 by bedtime, which was where I was sitting at the start of water loading, and I woke up at 181.4 on meet day feeling good.

A note on snacks: I ate an entire bunch of bananas and an entire box of uncrustables through the day, as well as 120 oz of gatorade. I had some oats for breakfast and some more after squat and I never felt over-full, like I was forcing food, or depleted, which is the best balance I've ever had on a meet day. On Friday, I made myself drink salt water, even though it was absolutely foul. This was the first meet where I didn't have a lat/erector cramp absolutely wreck me on bench, and I have to think that extra salt helped. I am also undefeated with Italian food as my dinner pre-meet. 

**MEET DAY (Third attempt videos:** [here)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWPEMW2A9yb/)

* **SQUAT (3/3)**
   * 405 (three whites). EZ PZ. 
   * 435 (two whites). 5 lb lifetime PR and 25 lb meet PR. looked easy, but didn't feel great, so I went more conservative than I had originally planned for my third. [video](https://imgur.com/a/eUFLHa8) of both opener and second.
   * 450 (two whites) 40 lb meet PR!! Exactly the right call for a third and while it slowed down, it wasn't a huge grind and didn't take it out of me for the rest of the day.

HUGE mental catharsis from last fall. I didn't realize how much that was still haunting me. I didn't stress about hitting depth the entire prep because I finally figured out that in wraps, I have to send my hips back before I break at the knees. This was my first meet in the Pioneer wraps and they are the perfect balance of stopping power and spring for me. HIGHLY recommend, particularly if you're a quad-dominant/knees forward squatter like me.

* **BENCH (3/3)**
   * 185 (three whites). Easy but didn't feel awesome, so I remembered my lesson from August and went conservative on my second. I also dropped my rack height a notch and that helped a TON.
   * 195 (three whites). Easy and glorious redemption from missing it twice in August. 5 lb PR. Fiancé called for 205 on my third, but I wanted to be SURE I would nail 200 after missing it last year, so I went conservative again. [videos of first and second.](https://imgur.com/a/uh0BqLa)
   * 200 (three whites) FINALLY I DID IT YAYYYYYYYYYYY. Also, my butt came off the bench and they did not call it, so the lesson here is have a giant ass so the judges can't tell if it's all the way off the bench or not. 

This was the first time in EIGHT MEETS where my back did not cramp during bench!!! Between August and now, I changed my set-up and though my arch isn't as big, I don't cramp nearly as much--so I'm glad I ate the humble pie to make the changes. 195 and 200 were both redemption numbers for me and it's amazing to finally hit 200 where it matters. My bench has a long way to go compared to my other two lifts, obviously, but slowly and surely, it's improving.

* **DEADLIFT** **(3/3)**
   * 385 (3 whites). Felt like air. When I took this as an opener in training, it looked like dogshit even though it was fast, so let that be a lesson to everyone that shedding fatigue is a big deal. This also locked in 1035, which is the qualifying total for the women's pro/am pro day!
   * 405 (3 whites). Moved so fast I didn't realize I had lifted it until I realized I was standing there waiting for the down command. I can't believe I can regularly smoke 400+. [videos of first and second.](https://imgur.com/a/eouvNeq)
   * 420 (3 whites). Lifetime and platform 10 lb PR, with a little in the tank, and my all-time favorite platform moment. I never understood how people could smile at the top of a lift until I did it. 
* **TOTAL 1,070 LBS** **(70 lb meet PR); 9/9**

This was the first time in my powerlifting career that I went 9/9 and the first time I had pounds in the tank. (I went 8/8 and scratched my last attempt a few years ago, but that's not the same). I had absolute confidence in every attempt the entire day. I know visualization, etc. works well for a lot of lifters, but what I've discovered is that going full caveman brain and going ""no brain only lift"" is the secret to keeping me calm and executing the way I have trained on max effort lifts. For most of the week leading into the meet, I really didn't think too much about lifting; I stayed really busy at work, focused on chugging water, and getting good sleep every night. Nothing fancy, just treating meet day like another training day. And it was the most fun training day of my life.

I checked open powerlifting when I got home and turns out I notched the 2nd highest total and squat for 181 wrapped lifters in the APF this year, I'm now the #11 wrapped 181 all time in APF, tied for the #7 heaviest wrapped squat for 181s all-time in APF, and tied for the #22 biggest total for all wrapped 181s (all feds) in 2021. That's...pretty cool and I never expected I'd be anywhere near any of that when I started in 2017 and squatted 242. 

Powerlifting rules, you guys. Next stop, pro day and 1100+.","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background:** I have been powerlifting since 2019, and this is my 4th powerlifting meet. With the pandemic, and a state job that has me working every other weekend, I'm lucky if I even compete once a year at this point. Also, because I compete with USAPL, everything I do gets recorded into a [lifter profile](https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=55690)

**Training:** I haven't really followed any kind of program. I work a week on, week off type of schedule so, for awhile, I would just train in my off week. The gym I go to doesn't allow chalk, so for awhile my deadlifts suffered. The gym at work has chalk, but the equipment is pretty terrible so benching and squats are out of the question, but I can go heavy on deadlifts.

Eventually, it dawned on me that I can work around this by doing a week of heavy weight and a week of lighter weight. I learned to really hate EMOM deadlifts, put strict press back as a priority in my training, and started doing some front squats.

Near the end, I took a page or two out of u/mythicalstrength 's book of bad ideas, and started hammering on some +2 squats, starting at 365lbs. It's brutal. I had a good 365x2, and when that didn't turn into 365x3 at the next squat session, I punished myself by turning that nonsense into +3 squats. Definitely a good way to see some stars.

On front squats, I would do some burpees in between sets, and really tried to tower of babel it as best as I could, with some variations in there due to time constraints (when I'm at work, I get maybe a half hour to work out during lunch break).

&nbsp;

**diet:** Definitely the worst part of me. When I'm at work, if I haven't meal prepped beforehand, its been either gas station food, or quick meals from the supermarket, or (on days), food from the kitchen, which tends to be loaded with carbs, even for staff. Off-week I eat a little better. Breakfasts are usually either oatmeal with peanut butter mixed in, or sausage and eggs. Lunch tends to be something like burgers and meatloaf. Dinner is also something like that. Sometimes pizza. Honestly I tend to eat two big meals in a day and call it good. I think most people overthink this anyway. Get your protein in, and get your calories in. Train hard and move on with life.

&nbsp;

**Meet prep:** If there's one thing I have taught my body, it's how to hit the weights cold. While everyone was hitting the warmup stations, figuring out how to work in, trying not to warm up too early and go cold, I was in the crowd, with my wife, watching the ladies compete and, enjoying the competition, and not worrying about any of that.

**meet day:** weighed in at 90kg, 2kg under my previous weigh in from around a year ago. We had 17 competitors, and, as is par for Alaska, a lot of them were the only ones in their weight class. There were two in mine, and it was clear from the start I was already competing for second place.

&nbsp;

**Diet:** I tend to eat pretty freely. If Im on my on week, my diet sucks a lot more. If im on my off week, it's a lot better and more suited for training. lots of protein, some carbs, and cutting down on sugar more and more. I have started preferring 93/7 or 96/4 cuts of ground beef because it just cooks up so much easier with less mess. You can add fat or whatever from somewhere else.

&nbsp;

**Meet prep:** train when I can, eat well. I work week on, week off, and am stuck at work for the entirety of a 12 hour day, with a 45 minute commute. So I'm stuck at a crappy work gym on my on week.

That crappy gym has forced me to skip bench pressing for one week, and back squats for one week, because the gym equipment is literally that terrible. The bars are bent, the bench is crooked, the squat cage has too big of jumps. But it has chalk.

Contrast with my off week, where I can squat and bench in peace, but can't do chalk. For the longest time I would just skip working out when on-site, until I realized that I could set up things such that I can train light one week, and train heavy the next week, because my work week is thursday-wednesday.

With that in mind, it's actually kind of great. In lieu of being able to run an actual program, I actually got into running a few of u/mythicalstrength's bad ideas, and have been slowly getting accustomed to EMOM deadlifts.

Depending on how I feel, I would skip days or weeks entirely or double up to get back on schedule. Etc. No set schedule, no set regimen, just worked hard, got strong, and refused to let time off allow my body to weaken.

Also, I never warmed up in training.

&nbsp;

**Meet day:** picked fairly conservative openers, stuff I knew I had hit before, to get on the board. Also figured if I ran into issues I could just pack more on to the deadlift.  I packed two meals but really only needed half of one. Did pack some tomatoes and Himalayan pink salt though, and had some of that. Plenty of water, as well, and two riot energy drinks, downed one before squats and the other before deadlift. Also weighed in at 90kg even naturally.

&nbsp;

**The lifts:**

Squats [165](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4fXRlE0L_U)/[170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrWWvWCrr5Q)/[172.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ4OQVowpI4)

Hit all of these. 165 felt good. 170 felt heavy so I eased back a bit and selected 172.5kg let me see stars and I didn't even have to go to space, or hollywood. Oh and it's also a competition PR.

First attempt: As far as I can figure, I just wasn't tight here. I'm happy the judges called it missing a jump command, because it allowed me to clear my head, focus on getting tight, and going for it. No PRs here, unfortunately, and missing the first attempt like this forced me to salvage bench press as best as I could.

Deadlifts [170](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngsTEQBFctc)/[180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3FhQoyvRF4)/[190](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-m_gICt1hM)

All of these went up well, and I'm really happy about the third attempt being a competition PR. I might have had another 2.5kg or 5kg in me, but hitting 190 did everything I needed to do this day.

**results:**

Totalled 465kg, for a competition PR of +20kg, while dropping 2kg. Since I came in with a goal of a +17.5kg pr, I actually did better than I hoped. Also went 8/9 on attempts, another PR!","powerlifting, fitness"
"**About Me**

Age: 44, Weight - 190 pounds  


**Program:** [**https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/bench-more-to-bench-more**](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/bench-more-to-bench-more)

**Results**

Max before program - 285

Max after program - 290

**Thoughts**

After all this benching, I was disappointed in only a 5 pound increase, especially when reading all these other posts where people are adding 20 pounds. I pretty much did the program as prescribed adding 10 pounds each week. The only time I deviated from this was the fourth day of week 3 in which I only added 5 pounds. The fourth day of the last two weeks was quite difficult, especially since it was back-to-back to day 3. I never failed a single rep.

I finished the program on a Thursday and tested today (Wednesday). 290 was quite difficult and I failed 295.

Any ideas why I didn't have more success with this? Any recommendations on what to try next? Thanks!","powerlifting, fitness"

"Background: 
So basically I’ve been actually training towards doing powerlifting since January 2020. I signed up for my first meet then, and a couple months before that meet in October signed up for this one because I felt like I might mess up at the first one(I did) and wanted to have another chance at it. I’m not all the way new to lifting, I did do a bit in high school and was decent at it then as far that goes. For most of my life I’ve been involved in some kind of physical activity except for when I was in a bad/low point of my life in my early twenties where I wasted a lot of time being a piece of shit when I could’ve been living a happy life powerlifting. But that’s a different story and not for this sub. Anyways I’m not sure if that’s the info we’re looking for as far as background but that’s about all I’ve got for you there. Lol.

Training

As far as training goes: I’ve run Unity 2.0 and Program X(2x) by John Meadows leading up to this meet. I also found out about Jim Wendler’s 531 and gave it a shot and have been running it for about 6 months. I start with 531 before running the other program for the first 3 days of the week. I train 5-6 days a week normally . I will sometimes randomly go for a 10 mile run about every 3 months when I get the chance to “knock the dust off” as I call it.  I really need to just do more cardio in general but yeah, you know. 

Diet

So I actually had my diet under great control(staying under calories, hitting my macros, not eating trash) up until about 3 weeks out from this meet. (I know, why would I get lax when I was so close) Well, it really wasn’t a huge difference but it ended up making my cut a little more intense than I wanted it to be. I was normally sitting around 142. When I got to meet week I was about 145. I wanted to compete in the 63kg weight so now I was 7lbs away. I was like okay no big deal, 7lbs is nothing compared to the last incredibly stupid and painful cut I pulled to get into 60kg in my first meet.(I know everyone is cringing) but something that cut did teach me was what my body was and wasn’t capable of doing under extreme stress. But normally, I try to stay on track and eat right to the best of my ability but still not exactly perfect all the time. I strive to get my diet completely on point and keep it there always but it’s always been the hardest thing for me fitness-wise. 

Meet Prep

I actually had just competed Oct. 2nd(about a month before this competition)So I trained normally for 2 weeks immediately after to try and milk that time the best I could. Then, two weeks out I actually remembered about how I had saw stuff about “peaking” on here and didn’t quite know what that meant exactly. (Obv. Knew it had something to do with getting ready for the meet but didn’t know what that entailed) So I looked around on the internet and found a peaking template by Barbell Medicine. I was already about to be two weeks out so I picked the “Advanced Fast Peak” option and started on week 2. I actually loved doing this because I felt like doing the big 3 more just helped me simply in doing these lifts more than once a week. (Besides doing speed bench on Thursday as always) I was feeling super strong on everything and actually really confident going into this meet. I was hitting all my reps with ease and even was able to pause squat with 226(my opener for meet#1 that I failed twice) Other than that I really didn’t have much prep. If you have any more info on peaking or prep you’d want to share in the comments with me I would be super grateful! 

Meet Day 

On meet day I woke up around 3AM to get ready. Packed our cooler and headed for Chicago. It was about a 3.5 hour drive. My amazing husband drove me, bless his heart. He drives/will drive me to all my meets because I’m TERRIFIED of driving on big highways and all around am just a pretty awful driver. I grew up on a dead end gravel road in the middle of nowhere and basically the farthest I’ve ever driven myself is Indianapolis and that’s even taxing on someone like me. Anyways, he’s the best- the real MVP here. So the trip up there wasn’t too bad, I was obviously dying of thirst and slept about 4 hours because I find it extremely hard to sleep on a cut even though all you want to do is sleep? Before I left the house I was exactly 138. We got there about an hour and a half early because of the time change. Waiting around to eat and drink sucked pretty bad and time was holding still. 8:30 finally rolls around and the ladies start walking back to the weigh in area. Most of the female lifters were gathered at this point so I wasn’t going to be shy and end up last in line and I was about ready to keel over if I didn’t get something to drink in the next 5 minutes so I popped up and stood where I figured they would form a line. I step on the scale and you can imagine my surprise when I get there and I’m only 134. I’ve essentially just accidentally lost 11lbs. I only needed 7 or 8 for good measure. This time was different though. This was a 2-hour weigh-in. I immediately drank my hyperaid(electrolyte and glycogen drink by steel that I like) and 3 bottles of water. Then I ate a packed of hostess mini chocolate donettes. I also brought a gallon of chocolate milk and start chugging that here and there. I then proceeded to make myself a giant ham and salami sandwich with Colby jack cheese and ate some chips with it. I also had a couple Oreos. And I drank a Gatorade cause it sounded good. Then by that time it was time to warm up for squat. Also at this time I started to feel real sick. It was also about 100 degrees in the gym bc it was a basement with a shit ton of people in it so I was sweating balls and also feeling like I might puke so I took my belt off when I was warming up. I was worried about how shitty I was feeling but it was game time so I sucked it up. 

Lifts
As some of you may already know, Squat has started to become my worst enemy. Today I didn’t want to risk not getting a total again so I went very conservative to a point where I didn’t really set myself up for success on my third attempt. Even though not oh well because I’m still bitter. 

First Attempt - 92.5kg /204
Something I could get without a doubt ever, because I didn’t want a repeat of failing my first attempt twice.
No reason to really share this video but here it is anyways. 3 Whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/_XvdZ3ncnKU?feature=share

Second Attempt - 97.5kg/214
Should’ve gone to 102.5 because this again was something I was sure of and I’m still mad that I played it so safe here.
3 Whites.
https://youtube.com/shorts/ISg6Z4iWFDc?feature=share

Third Attempt - 110kg/242.5
Got ballsy and decided to go for it, only to choke and forget all my cues and how to squat all together. Husband took a moving picture instead of a video here for some reason but here’s a still shot.

https://imgur.com/a/HejcgYR
Got stuck way down in the hole. Stupid.

Bench 
I was already super relieved to be done with squat and show everyone what I’m really made of. 

First Attempt - 70kg/154lbs
Could do this one even if it was a 5 minute pause. I felt good. Still jumped the command even though I had just told myself .3 seconds earlier to listen, and got no lift. No big deal. 

https://youtube.com/shorts/q5ABCZDjjVM?feature=share

Second Attempt - 75kg/165lbs
Felt great about this one too and went up pretty nicely. 3 whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/BGnMpfhFCIE?feature=share

Third Attempt - 80kg/176lbs
Thought I had this one in the bag but really didn’t take the time to brace correctly and didn’t use any leg drive so I ran out of gas pretty close to the chest. Wish I would’ve went a little lighter on my selection. 

https://youtube.com/shorts/QRKvL2noa-A?feature=share

Deadlift
Felt kinda blah warming up, so I used the same opener as last meet. It served as a good confidence boost and a good last warm-up.
First Attempt - 125kg/275.5
Easy peasy, snapped right up.

https://youtube.com/shorts/z-rGq1A6mww?feature=share
3 Whites.

Second Attempt - 137.5kg/303lbs
Wanted to go heavier than last meet for this one(292lbs) so I went a little bigger to try and set up a good third.
It was a slow lift but I still felt okay about it.
3 Whites.

https://youtube.com/shorts/xxqDn7flu-A?feature=share

Third Attempt - 145kg/319.67lbs
Since 303 moved so slowly I didn’t want to go crazy on this one, but wanted to beat my last meet PR. And I did by almost 6lbs which was cool. Wish I would’ve just went all out though kinda and tried something close to 330. Idk what this one looked like unfortunately bc my husband taped the ceiling bc he was too in the moment I think. 

All in all as far as meet quality it was nothing like East Race in South Bend. I definitely got spoiled by that first meet. This one wasnt bad, I just liked it better when there was music blasting. 

Moving forward I am competing yet again this year, December 12th at the Missouri River Open in St. Louis. Trust me when I say I really didnt know what I was signing up for when I so impulsively entered myself in four meets this year. So much goes into a meet, definitely not something you should just wing like I have basically this entire time. But that being said, I wouldn't change any of it, because in just those two meets I've learned a million different things about this sport and had experiences that I will never forget. There's no feeling quite like being out on that platform. Still undecided if I want to put my body through another brutal cut but most likely I will. Hoping in this short time frame to hone in on my squat and bring those numbers up to where I can at least try and make it up in my bench and deadlift. 
After Missouri I'm finishing up my year with one more meet. It's a USPA one called Liftmas and its only about an hour away from where I live, so I said fuck it why not. After that I plan on taking the year off on competing to get better and come back even stronger next year. Don't hold me to that though. Lol. Thanks for reading!

"TL;DR 1st meet in 6 years. 601/402/551 -1554 lbs total raw at 274.5 bw [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzh9sbfz4aU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzh9sbfz4aU)

**Background:**

I started powerlifting competitively in 2010. I competed in NASA, USAPL, and APF and mainly in the 308/SHW class although I started out as a 242 lifter. I had great success for many years culminating in my best meet ever in 2015 with a 1730 lb total. After that meet, I started noticing knee pain I had never experienced before. Totally messed with my head and squats were always my best lift and suddenly I didn’t feel right doing them. I was 300 lbs and I started to hate the fact that I allowed myself to balloon up to such a weight just to hit higher numbers. I made a decision in 2015 to focus on getting my bodyweight down and change my lifting routine to something more bodybuilding in nature. I had lost a ton a weight by 2016/2017 and weighed around 220 lbs. I basically stopped powerlifting altogether until last year. November last year my training partner with whom I competed for my entire competing career, convincing me to jump back into powerlifting so we decided to enter a meet set for April.

**Programming:**

My training partner wrote all of our programming. We decided to do a 4 month prep. The programming started out with basically 4-6 week volume training. December we did 3 sets of 10 on squat, bench, deadlift with a lot of assistance work. We decided to train hamstrings a ton this time around. In February the volume came down and did sets of 5 with the main lifts and still incorporated various assistance work. The last month or so we hit sets of 3, then 2, and then finally peaking with singles in the last week of training. Surprisingly my knee issue really didn’t factor in until we started hitting doubles and singles. It did bother me sometimes and other times it didn’t.

**Goals:**

I knew hitting PRs in this meet wasn’t really in the cards so I came up with a gameplan of what I wanted out of this meet. I wanted a 600 lb squat, a 400 lbs bench, and at least a 500 lb deadlift. I figured a 1500 lb total coming back after 6 years of no powerlifting training was something I could feel good about.

**Meet day:**

I slept like shit the night before the meet. I was anxious as all hell but extremely excited. My flight was  the 3rd out of 4 so I got to watch the first flight and I was getting so jacked up emotionally from the atmosphere. I really missed competing at a meet. The crowd was pretty large and the energy was palpable.

Squat: My warm ups for squat went extremely well. I opened with 501 lbs and absolutely crushed it. I took 551 for my second attempt and I also crushed it. I knew I had a decision to make. I could go for 600 or take something conservative and hit a high 500. My training partner pushed me to go for 600 and I made the call. To my surprise I nailed it with a little grindage. Got what I came for.

Bench: Bench warm ups felt good. I opened with 353. Crushed it. Took 380 for my second and nailed it. I went for a 402 on my last attempt which was a state record. It was a grind but I got the 402 attempt. Goal nailed.

Deadlift: I was exhausted at this point. The meet was entering hour 9-10. My deadlift warms up were fine but I knew I was running out of gas. I opened super conservative with 455. It was easy. Went to 501 on my second. Crushed. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my 3rd attempt. I hadn’t gone over 500 in training leading up to this meet. My training partner told me to go for 551. It was absolutely easy as well. I probably could have hit a high 500 for my deadlift.

**General Meet Commentary:**

This was my first foray into the USPA. The meet was pretty large with 60+ lifters in it. There was some technical problems in the first flight that made it drag out 2 hours. They were able to fix the software issue and the remaining day went faster. Still, this meet didn’t end until around 8pm. I had never competed in a meet that went this long. It was tough to stay energized for that amount of time but overall I was very happy with the meet and was happy to say I hit my goal. Now I plan on competing again in the fall. I got my passion for powerlifting back!","powerlifting, fitness"
"**Background and Training**

Hey all, time for my meet report. The last couple of years have been rough as fuck, and my training really reflects that. This is also a (mediocre) coach review of Chris Lentini(/u/goose_dies) and his sadistic tendencies. Here’s a quick summary of my training/personal life since I started in September 2018.

August 2018 - Wife has an ectopic pregnancy, needs emergency surgery

September 2019 - I begin strength training. I think I ran a bro split for a few months? Then hopped on 531 for Beginners.

January 2019 -  1st miscarriage

September 2019 - First meet. S/B/D were 308, 165, 385. I ran out of steam around this time and took a break until February 2020.

2020: COVID. Made my home gym around May. Started training with Chris in June. Details on that below.
July 2020: 2nd miscarriage

October 2020: Ran out of mental steam and give a fuck. Took a break from training. Got into therapy. Prescribed antidepressants and ADHD medication shortly after.

December 2020 - Started training again. On and off consistency at first

January 2021 - Trained constantly for 1 month. Contacted Chris and began training with him again.

April 2021 - My wife and I separated. Also had my hormone levels checked, prescribed TRT.

OK, enough of the depressing shit that is my current life, onto the good stuff.


**Mini Coach Review**


Chris Lentini is a USPA WR holder,  and quite a few of his athletes have state, national and I believe a couple of world records. He is a big fan of paused, tempo, and bands. Often all 3 on one lift. He uses a training max and wave periodization for progression. The training itself is 5 days, 3 of which are focused on the big 3 or variations of it. The other 2 are more assistance/supplemental work. He also is a disciple of John Meadows and uses a lot of Meadow’s bodybuilding stuff in the assistance work. I highly recommend his coaching. Prices are reasonable, and he cleaned the fuck out of my form on 3 lifts, and he can make a lot of cool stuff for you(plates, deadlift jacks, eccoarms, the murderbar and other goodies). 

I first started training with Chris in June 2020, after seeing a post in /r/Powerlifting. At this point I had just scooped up equipment for my home gym because of covid. At the time, I had a rack, about 300lbs in weights and a homemade axle bar. Chris is a metal fabricator, and made me 6 45s and a sick deadlift jack. I eventually was able to scoop up an EliteFTS Iron Cowboy bar.

My best (pre-covid)gym lifts at the time were:

Bench: 185

Squat: 345x2(with sketchy depth)

Deads: 385

Training was great for a stretch, and I worked up to a 210lb bench, 345 squat and a 425 deadlift in August of that year, before I took my mental health break. 

I started working back with him in February of this year, and found a meet in May that I wanted to hit. During my break, all of my lifts regressed, due to diet, stress, and weight loss from depression. Per my sheet, my S/B/D was 235/175/365. My peak was kinda janky due to work, and there was a couple of times where I couldn’t train due to this or my depression kicking my ass.


**Meet Report**


This was my first USPA meet and I did much better this time around. I registered in the 90kg class, Open Raw and weighed in at 84.4kg. My diet the day of consisted of Granite Supplements pre and intra carb and aldi's brand protein bars. I drove down the day before for weigh-ins and crashed at an AirBNB for the night. 

SQUAT:

Attempt 1 - 137.5kg - 3 Whites - Really sank these today

Attempt 2 - 150kg - 3 Whites - Still pretty

Attempt 3 - 165kg - 3 Whites - Bit of a grinder, but I murdered the depth

BENCH:

Attempt 1 - 80kg - 3 Whites - Nice and easy

Attempt 2 - 85kg - 3 Whites - Still pretty easy

Attempt 3 - 90kg - 3 Reds - Died on the way up. Only failed lift of the day

DEADLIFT:

Attempt 1 - 175kg - 3 Whites - Easy Peasey

Attempt 2 - 190kg - 3 Whites - Still went up smooth

Attempt 3 - 205kg - 3 Whites - Bit of a grind, but I think I could’ve done a little heavier.

Final Thoughts

Overall a great day. My lead up could’ve been better, but Istill set new meet PRs in every lift. Taking Monday and Tuesday off then staring back light on Wednesday. And working on upping my bodyweight(I can hear /u/benchpauper shouting 242).","powerlifting, fitness"
"Stats: 
Age - 17
Weight - 230
Training age: 3 months when starting 

PRs before starting: 205/145/290 

PRs after: 265/165/330

This program is one of the many programs translated from Boris Sheiko’s book. It endures 4 weeks, and it requires you to go 3 days each week.

It’s mainly for increasing SBD, hence why you do at least 2 compounds each day. There’s about 2 accessories each day such as Good Mornings and Flies; 3 accessories if you’re lucky

Program experience:

As someone who’s never attempted a program before hand, the volume was gruelling. 

My experience with the program was enjoyable, since I was able to gain somewhat a decent amount on SBD, but I don’t know whether that’s to me training properly for the first time or newbie gains. 

SBD experience:

I was only doing deadlift variations ( Rack pulls, Deadlifts to knees) once a week , but it still somehow improved my deadlift overall.T his claims to be a ‘beginner’ program, yet it doesn’t state a warning about hamstring cramps, so be wary for that. 

With squats, I was very pleased. The reason it took me so long to do some type of program was due to my ankle mobility on squats , which took quite a while too fix. Squatting 3 times a week was rough though ( 2 sets on 1 day during the week) was a shift and a half. But clearly the shift came with a good cheque, so like I said; PLEASED.

Bench was not intense whatsoever, so I’d recommend to anyone to put your bench on the program about 5-10lbs up. My bench did improve but the working sets didn’t not feel as demanding as the other ones.

During the 4 weeks, squats I failed , deadlift I failed , but not a single bench was failed, so I suggest increasing the bench 1RM

Diet and sleep:

Also, I wasn’t to state my sleep was about 5 hours and diet was very off, where most days I didn’t reach my protein intake, so you could expect greater results.","powerlifting, fitness"
"Competing in the 105kg (231lb) class. Weighed in at 102.17kg (225lb). This was my first ever meet, wanted to go in and do what I could, figure it all out.

[Squat 1 - 195kg (429lb)](https://streamable.com/tve3nq) . Wanted to be a little conservative on this, just smash something out the way. Figuring out the warmups and stuff was interesting but had somewhat of a plan and smashed this pretty easy, felt good! All whites.

[Squat 2 - 205kg (452lb)](https://streamable.com/y2005c). This one was easy as well, I probably could've done a little more but didn't want to make huge jumps and miss out. All whites.

[Squat 3 - 215kg (474lbs)](https://streamable.com/nkzopa). Jumped another 10kg, got into this one and it was a lot easier than I thought. All whites, 3/3 on squats. 

[Bench 1 - 157.5kg (347lb)](https://streamable.com/5ny4vk). This is where things got sticky. My lower back cramped/seized up on my first warmup set for bench, definitely made a mistake of not pre-emptively rolling it after squats. I felt okay, was able to smash this pretty easily. 3 whites.

Bench 2 & 3: 167.5kg (369lb). I've smashed this in training but was not getting it today. Lower back grabbing was a big part of it. My 2nd set I wasn't able to get setup properly and my 3rd just couldn't get it right. Almost got it up on the 3rd but I think the margin of error was too shot. I should've gone conservative on my 2nd jump knowing my back was tight but live and learn! Three reds, each time.

[Deadlift 1 - 210kg (463lb)](https://streamable.com/czusc0). I purposefully went light to open my deadlifts, I knew going in that my bench was probably going to be higher than most so if I went light I'd have a good basis to judge how much I'd need in order to get a victory. Another issue is that I can't have chalk at my gym, so the transition worried me. Got this pretty easily. 3 whites

[Deadlift 2 - 215kg (474 lb)](https://streamable.com/l1y7jj). I just went up very light here, I knew all I had to do was hit this and I would win for sure. Felt pretty good, back was still meh but got it up for 3 whites

[Deadlift 3 - 227.5kg (502 lb)](https://streamable.com/jy8g2a). I was at a crossroads for this one. After my 2nd one I knew I won first in my weight class so here I could either go for a 1300lb total or I could try to get a 500lb deadlift. I decided to go for the 500lb deadlift, I thought I had it but that slight hitch there gave me 3 reds. Oh well! 

All in all, I placed first in my weight class (7 total participants), I had the 3rd highest bench press in the competition (74? male competitors) and 7th highest squat and was tied for 8th highest overall total (Not sure about wilks rankings yet). Definitely could have done better if everything went perfect but sometimes things don't go perfect! A really good first meet, very happy to get the win and looking forward to really hammering to improve my deadlift in the next few weeks, on the quest for a 4/5/6 now!","powerlifting, fitness"
